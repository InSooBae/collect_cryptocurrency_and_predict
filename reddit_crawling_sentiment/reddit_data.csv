dzg9zw,Binance acquires Mumbai‚Äôs bitcoin exchange WazirX,"&amp;#x200B;

[www.zeusbtc.com](https://preview.redd.it/6916tcn620041.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74e23071f874b4249c376fa3cb53cadce4180ba)

BENGALURU: Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, has acquired Mumbai-based bitcoin exchange WazirX, in a significant move in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India.

The transaction was estimated at $5-10 million, according to sources.Over the last couple of years, exchanges have been shutting down due to lack of a clear regulation, and this acquisition is the first major one in the space. Through this acquisition Binance is expected to foray into the fledgling Indian market, which is counted among the top exchanges globally.

ET had reported earlier that WazirX launched its global operations earlier this year and its peer-to-peer and cryptoto-crypto transactions.

WazirX‚Äôs peer-to-peer (P2P) engine will be integrated into the Binance Fiat Gateway platform in the first quarter of 2020, allowing users to trade any digital asset available on Binance with the purchase of USDT or Tether, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, from the WazirX P2P market.

‚ÄúThe young demographic in India gives an edge to adopt and build on new financial technologies, and I believe this will play a vital role in making India a global blockchain innovation centre to also spur cryptocurrency adoption throughout the larger public in the country,‚Äù said Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.

‚ÄúIndia will be one of our first forays into stimulating financial growth and access in developing nations beyond the country,‚Äù Zhao told ET. ‚ÄúWe will be continuing to work towards furthering crypto adoption, lowering the barrier to entry. One of the main goals is to add more fiat currencies to Binance and work with local partners to add as many fiat-to-crypto pairs as possible.‚Äù

WazirX users will now be able to buy and sell crypto using the Indian currency on the Binance Fiat Gateway. Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX, will continue to run its operations independently from India. ‚ÄúThe acquisition will now help us to expand our P2P business geographically. The next phase of mass adoption for crypto will arise from developing nations. India, with more than a billion people, is primed for massive crypto adoption,‚Äù said Shetty.

The native WazirX token (WRX) is currently available through trade mining, signups and an upcoming token sale is also under consideration.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzg9zw/binance_acquires_mumbais_bitcoin_exchange_wazirx/,Moustache_Group,1,2019-11-21 08:25:56,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzg9zw/binance_acquires_mumbais_bitcoin_exchange_wazirx/,NaN

dzl1do,BITCOIN SAFETY,"Hello My dear Hodlers,

I know reddit community has many veterans who are just way too informative about Bitcoin Birth,usage,future prospects etc.,I might not be a great talented geek about Cryptos but this question always keep pricking in my mind,many of us might have lost/scammed/misplaced the private keys etc., and I completely agree that Bitcoin is a decentralized asset where you are your own boss to gain it or loose it,in this case should only Technical geeks use Bitcoin ? When you buy a product from store if it goes bad/lost you have the right to question the store person but here you buy\[no question on mining\] the Bitcoin and if something goes wrong you have no one to complain and ur at ur own rescue !

dzq2kd,"If you buy bitcoin from an ATM machine, and it gets stuck at less than 6 confirmations in your wallet, is there some timeframe where if it's stuck for longer than x amount of time, it'll just never go through and get returned to sender (the ATM machine) and you'll just lose your money?","I've spent hours trying to search about this, and every question I've found seems to be about people stuck at zero confirmations.

In my case, it did get 3 confirmations reasonably quickly, but then it just never got any more confirmations, it's just been stuck at 3 for like a day, and it needs to get to 6+ before I can actually use it in my wallet to spend it myself.

I am fairly new to this stuff, so I was pretty freaked out when I read some stuff about how if a long enough timespan goes by (several days?) then if it is still stuck at less than (6? not sure how many) confirmations by that point, it'll just be a failed transaction and get returned to the sender.

If that happens, I just lose all my money that I spent trying to buy the bitcoin from the bitcoin ATM machine, right?  Because in this case it's not some human friend of mine I can go try again with, it's just some machine, so the machine/company gets its bitcoin back, and but I can't just go walk up to the machine and have it spit my cash back to me I assume.

So, now I'm trying to figure out how many more hours or days I have left before that is going to happen.

Around 2:55 in this video https://youtu.be/TjuzBZnhXJU a miner explains that it costs around 7400 to make a bitcoin. When the price drops below this level it would be very difficult for a miner to sell at a loss. Some miners will leave as they will be in the red if this happens and the ones that stay will most likely do so to remain profitable which means holding bitcoin until the price goes above this level.

Instead, bitcoin is  competing with the dollar, euro, yen and gold as money, and any  comparison to Visa, its transaction volume or transaction speed is  fundamentally flawed. Bitcoin fulfills the role of currency issuer and  final settlement. As a result, the proper comparison would be between  bitcoin and the Fed as currency issuer and as a clearing mechanism.

The common example associated with Bitcoin is the QR code. QR codes represent the set of black and white boxes that are related to barcodes. Barcodes are a line of channels, and QR codes represent a network of squares. Bitcoin uses QR codes because they can store more data in a little area, and the camera , e.g., the smartphone will see them. These two QR codes on the Bitcoin note represent the national and personal speeches, and will be read with a number of online tools. Everyone in this Bitcoin system is considered the individual, and all addresses are created equal. All transactions will happen only from individual to individual, but a number of websites exist to make these transactions simpler. These websites are named exchanges. Exchanges offer instruments for dealing in Bitcoin. Some permit the acquisition of Bitcoin from outside reports, and others provide trading with different cryptography-based currencies like Bitcoin. Most exchanges also offer the standard \`\` case '' service.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzur2k/bitcoin_qr_code_generator/,malestatestanding,1,2019-11-22 02:55:21,3,/r/Bitcoin/comments/dzur2k/bitcoin_qr_code_generator/,NaN

e00275,How to save Bitcoin on transfers between cryptocurrency exchanges?,"Cryptocurrencies have become quite commonplace for many people. Every day, tens of thousands of transfers are made between wallets and exchanges around the world. However, few of us think about how much money is spent on paying commissions for transfers. In fact, some transactions lose a significant amount. For several months, the user can safely lose the amount that would be enough to buy a new TV or washing machine.Therefore, it will not be out of place for everyone to know how to save money on such operations. There are exchanges that charge 0.001 - 0.002 BTC (9 - 18 US dollars) for the transfer. There are those who ask a little less. For example, Poloniex asks for only 0.0005 BTC (about $ 5). However, having made 10 or 20 transfers, the amount ceases to seem so insignificant. Therefore, we offer a good option that will make transactions almost free.

## How to save my BTC?

First, you need to choose some alternative currency for making transfers. It must meet the following criteria:

* It should be low cost. The transfer fee will be lower when it will be possible to purchase more coins for the money available;
* On two exchanges selected by the user, there should be a minimum difference between the price of buy and sell orders;
* It is necessary to pay attention to the trading volume. The larger the number indicated for buying and selling, the less the course is subject to fluctuations, as a result of which the probability of a sharp change in the situation in the unnecessary direction will be lower.

The best coins to circumvent high commissions are Dogecoin and Bytecoin. Both meet the above criteria, but Dogecoin transactions are confirmed much faster.

## DOGECOIN 

DOGE is a fork of Litecoin. In technical terms, there were practically no changes, but in terms of marketing, both cryptocurrencies are significantly different from each other. The following features of this coin can be distinguished:

1. Block formation takes only 1 minute (LTC - 2.5 times longer, BTC - 10 times longer);
2. Infinite emission;

For the transaction you need to pay only 2 coins, regardless of the amount of transfer (this is only about $ 0.0047 or 5.1 \* 10 -7 BTC);This coin has all the attributes of popular cryptocurrencies (anonymity, decentralization, advanced security system).

## How it works?

As an example, you can exchange BTC for DOGE on some exchange, send them to another exchange, and then transfer the coins to your Poloniex wallet, paying a commission (unlike direct transfer).

You can give an example of a real case with detailed numbers: user N on the Bittrex exchange changes 0.01023405 BTC to DOGE, after which he sends them to the Poloniex exchange and receives 0.01019278 BTC. The final commission for the transfer came out 0.00004127 BTC, which is 24 times more profitable than directly transferring BTC between exchanges. You also need to add a fee for transferring to a cold wallet (a little more than one dollar), but even with this in mind, the difference still remains noticeable.

And one moment. After exchanging cryptocurrency for DOGE and transferring them to a wallet or exchange, these coins need to be sold. There are a couple of options: sell them at the current purchase or sale price. Here everyone must choose their own. Sales price orders are usually sold in less than half a day.

In addition, it would simply be wrong not to mention another interesting fact about this wonderful coin. If you carefully look at the graph from Coinmarketcap of the DOGE price change, you can find one interesting detail. During the day, there may be a short-term sharp increase in the value of this asset. It is believed that due to the abnormally low commission, the coin is used on a large scale in arbitration operations, so by catching the right moment, you can also earn on DOGE. 

## 

[Doge chart \(Coinmarketcap\)](https://preview.redd.it/sul458f888041.jpg?width=1212&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e246c5b4d425191c29aa0c77e35d32f993ef895)

## Bytecoin

A few words about Bytecoin. It was created in 2012 on the same algorithm as Monero. This provides the coin with a high level of anonymity and privacy. The cost of one asset is also low - $ 0,0004. Transactions are processed every 120 seconds. It‚Äôs simply not possible to track payments. Of course, Bytecoin is not as popular as DOGE, but you can take a closer look at it as an alternative.

Today we looked at the best way to save money when transferring crypto assets between exchanges or wallets. Experienced traders most likely have their own tricks that help save the maximum amount of money, but this option is now seen as the most optimal, universal and practical. 

Currently, we are preparing to launch the [holderlab.io](https://www.holderlab.io/) service, which allows us to optimize the cryptocurrency portfolio. The service allows you to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the crypto portfolio using the correlation matrix and the effective border, as well as configure automatic portfolio rebalancing.

e01k4r,"Bitcoin Energy Cost ~$3,380 Due to Changes in Mining Efficiency Curve","Just a thought as the price drops out, since there are two remarkable events occurring:

1. The mining efficiency of the network is increasing greatly as Bitmain rolls out their newest miners like the  Antminer S17 Pro; no doubt they've been using their own equipment on the network before public sales as has been the historical case for big efficiency leap rigs.
2. Couple this with the somewhat usual end-of-year settling up that occurs between Nov - Jan that we've seen in the past.

Food for thought: as the higher efficiency rigs propagate the energy cost for mining Bitcoin nearly halves to $3,380 at 12.5 BTC. However, once the block reward cuts in half next year then the energy cost will double.

Is this market movement the result of mining groups offloading a lot of their cheaply mined coins at the higher value now before the price moves downwards towards the energy production cost?

e05urj,Question about the future of Bitcoin,"I was thinking about the future of bitcoin.  In a world where bitcoin sees mass-adoption, we already know only a small number of people can own a single bitcoin just by simple math.  So, that means practically all transactions would be based on Satoshies, since a single bitcoin would have enormous value.  What happens when people lose their bitcoin?  The same way people might drop $5 on the ground, people could lose track of their keys.  Sure, it's irresponsible, but humans are prone to mistakes.  Given that, bitcoins buying power would continue to rise thus causing the value of commodities to constantly change.  And does that mean that we'd essentially be buying and selling an indefinitely small amount of Satoshies?  Sorry if this seems confusing.  Just interested in how this might all work out.

e0e5ig,Finland prepares for cyberwarfare after receiving 235 Bitcoin ransom threats,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img p9rwbjmjqd041...*

Finland is preparing to defend itself against a mysterious activist group threatening to carry out cyberattacks ‚Äî unless it gets some Bitcoin.

More than 200 Finnish public organizations and municipalities have taken part in the drills. The scenario reportedly involves a hypothetical hacking crew demanding payment before waging various cyberattacks, Yleisradio Oy (YLE) reports.

These measures are in direct response to threats made by an activist group calling itself #Tietovuoto321 (‚Äúdata breach 321‚Äù), which sent Bitcoin ransom demands to 235 public organizations across Finland on October 10.

So far, government offices and towns have seen their websites and data systems come under simulated attack twice in the past month. A third practice day is reportedly scheduled for next week.

YLE noted that participating organizations have responded ‚Äúenthusiastically.‚Äù

Ransomware attacks on public facilities and municipalities have increased in frequency over the past year, and not just in Finland.

Hard Fork has previously reported that several US hospitals hit by ransomware attacks opted to pay the hackers to recover their systems.

Earlier this month, hackers held computer systems belonging to Mexican state-owned oil firm Pemex to ransom for a gut-twisting $4.9 million worth of Bitcoin.

It‚Äôs not all bad news, though. One ransomware victim recently exacted revenge on his attackers by infiltrating infrastructure powering their malware, releasing thousands of decryption keys to help others recover their files for free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0e5ig/finland_prepares_for_cyberwarfare_after_receiving/,Moustache_Group,1,2019-11-23 06:26:11,1,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0e5ig/finland_prepares_for_cyberwarfare_after_receiving/,NaN

I didn't plug my money into the cryptomarket as well I could have, I should have averaged it out more across a longer period of time, that said, iirc the inflation on bitcoins mined and released into the market prior to the next halvening is high compared to say our fiat USD...that will drastically change 5-10 years out when the inflation rate is substantially lower than inflation on fiat.

I believe there is a chance that the next recession could be a doozy, and say a substantial credit downgrade on US Treasury bonds, bond holders demanding higher interest rates, or the US somehow defaulting on its outstanding debt instead of say mass printing off a good $25,000,000,000,000 instead of absolving itself from debt...there could be a major change in the world order on USD being the world's currency.

In terms of conflicts among major powers this has been the most peaceful 80 years the planet has ever seen...I believe there will be a major event in our future where that is no longer the case, dystopian at minimum.

e0kzvs,Has Bitcoin failed?,"First of all I don‚Äôt want to shittalk bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Since 2015 I had Bitcoin on my radar and bought my first Bitcoin in november 2017. A lot of the following stuff was already written elsewhere but I want to share my thoughts of the last two years. 

A store of value.

Bitcoin was invented as P2P cash system by Craig Wright (nah, just kidding). The whitepaper clearly stated it and never mentioned it as a store of value. So what we need for a cash system? Scalability, and here is one problem of Bitcoin. It doesn¬¥t scale. With 7 transactions per second you cannot build a cashsystem, it is that simple. But the lightning network!! Right now there is only 6 million $ in the LN (capacity) and even that number is shrinking. Besides this low adoption in the LN you have a third counterparty to deal with and it has some technical flaws, recently one guy lost 4 btc due a technical bug. Hence you need a lightning wallet it‚Äôs not so easy to onboard nocoiners, most people didn‚Äôt grasp a normal btc wallet. So we can say that the lightning network is a technical playground for nerds but the majority of people in crypto never touched it. But back to the store of value argument, it came up as the mempools were full and the transaction fees sky rocked. Instead of saying ‚ÄúWe have a serious problem in our system‚Äù people came up with the store of value argument and people started writing books about it and put lipstick on the pig with a lot of money theory (Bitcoin standard). But if you just look at the volatility you¬¥ll see that this couldn‚Äôt be a store of value. I hate to admit it but even Tether is a better store of value than bitcoin. Only Bitcoins deflationary architecture is an argument for the store of value theory, but the numbers indicate, that people don‚Äôt use btc as a store of value or a payment system. They simply don‚Äôt use it. There is no adoption and for this reason steam removed btc as a payment option. I see it in my own behavior, why should I spend my btc when the value increases in the future. I don‚Äôt want to be the next bitcoin pizza buyer.

Doing the same mistakes twice.

I came into crypto because of the traditional banking and money system. I hate these greedy banksters and margintraders who almost crashed the economy in 2008. And what do we do in crypto? Instead of avoid such mechanisms we copy them. Yay, I can short bitcoin with a 100 leverage on bitmex or lending my coins to an exchange for x amount. The bitmex volume is ridiculously high, it is not directly tied to the bitcoin price but has a huge influence. I don‚Äôt want to mention all these scammy icos, ah I mean the new term ieos. And because we have no retail in it, we have no adoption. There are some companies like bitpay who started with a good intent but bottom line is, we have a middleman (again) and fees (besides the transaction fees).

Power consumption.

I think most arguments regarding die proof of work mechanism are not true. But one thing shouldn‚Äôt be dropped: the electric scrap. I recently came across some pictures of an abandoned mining farm in china, and they were so awful. The world is facing a climate crisis and we just create more and more scrap for mining our bitcoin. That is not a good thing in bitcoin.

So what is the solution?

Maybe there is none. People will not starting to pay their daily goods with bitcoin (because of the deflation). Most people don¬¥t care about the technology there just in for mad gains. And even if there in for the technology, what happened in the last years? The only thing in my mind is SegWit (slow clap) but the hashwar in that that time was so annoying.

Maybe the cryptocommunity itself is the best thing bitcoin has done. There are so many smart people outside who are now connected and doing great stuff. Perhaps we should go further and leave bitcoin behind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0kzvs/has_bitcoin_failed/,gdm41,1,2019-11-23 17:29:47,24,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0kzvs/has_bitcoin_failed/,NaN

I know that Electrum can be configured to accept a random list of words (user-generated) and to ignore the incorrect checksum.

What is the risk something to go wrong by using manually selected words (selected with dice and ""Bip39-diceware"" for example)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0m6ft/are_all_possible_bip39_mnemonic_seeds_produce_a/,tedjonesweb,1,2019-11-23 18:52:15,14,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e0m6ft/are_all_possible_bip39_mnemonic_seeds_produce_a/,NaN

Companion Web site (with source code): https://bitcoin-pi.com

**Description**:

Compile and run Bitcoin full nodes, lightning nodes, and user-friendly web-apps that help abstract the complexities of Bitcoin. This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin‚Äîwhat it is and why we need it‚Äîfind out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.¬†¬†The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.

With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Ntework-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.

The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well¬†¬†be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered ‚Äúuseful‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn‚Äôt stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.¬†¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e1jwst/bitcoin_and_lightning_network_on_raspberry_pi_book/,brakmic,1,2019-11-25 18:05:40,10,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e1jwst/bitcoin_and_lightning_network_on_raspberry_pi_book/,NaN

e1x27b,Bitcoin and New Ukrainian cinema,"&amp;#x200B;

Many people in Ukraine who have no connection to blockchain and cryptocurrency area, are aware about Bitcoin. One time I was returning from crypto-conference abroad and when taxi driver asked me where I've been, it happened he is also Bitcoin enthusiast and a trader. I also know a barman-trader, who is working full time in a bar and trades in a free time (and even had some kind of a fund). So no wonder that topic of Bitcoin entered many areas of life, especially art and creative industries, and in this short article I will focus on cinema. 

Ukrainian cinema nowadays has its Revival. Many films are created, from different genres and for different audiences, and now we see that Ukrainian movies are more viewed in cinemas, while in past cinema-market was dominated by Hollywood blockbusters and Russian shitmovies. Some films win prizes at international festivals. 

While the quantity of films is still much smaller than in other countries, I know at least 3 films which mention Bitcoin topic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Just Sex, Nothing Personal**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTBM7T0cpZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTBM7T0cpZI)

Genre: Comedy

Release date: December 20, 2018 

Director: Olga Ryashina

Production company: Star Media

In the beginning of the film, girlfriend leaves Serhii, the main hero of the film, saying that he is ""just an accountant"". - ""But I also deal with crypto"" - he responds, but this doesn't affect her decision as she claims that he is complete 0 in sex. 

Serhii goes to Prague for New Year to visit his friend, and meats a strip-dancer in a club, then falls in love with her. His ex-girlfriend was humiliating him in past, but as the time passes, somebody asked her if she saw the price of Bitcoin. She checks the price and understands how rich is her ex-boyfriend now, so she decided to return him and marry. 

Even though Bitcoin is small episode in this film, it's not even depicted in trailer, but it really shapes the whole story. 

Taking to account date of release, it could be real story a year before in 2017. 

We don't know if Serhii made millions or just some smaller amount, but it's enough to implement into life dream of his new girlfried ex-strip-dancer, to start a restaurant-cafe in her home city Lviv in Ukraine. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Foxter &amp; Max**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRmC8hHdGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRmC8hHdGk)

Genre: Comedy for children

Initial release: September 19, 2019

Director: Anatoli Mateshko

&amp;#x200B;

Timid 12-year-old schoolboy Max finds a can of nano-paint, and draws graffiti - dog. Unexpectedly drawn graffiti comes to life and turns into a nanorobot with super powers - a combination of biotech and AI. This nano-dog Foxter helps Max in life, but both of them are hunted by a dangerous criminal who wants to take possession of this powerful technology in order to mine cryptocurrency and hack, withdraw cryptocurrencies from others' accounts to his. Well, as usually in comedies - there is happy end.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Nightmare Director, or School # 5**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFqfX3Wivn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFqfX3Wivn4)

Genre: Comedy

Release date: October 31, 2018 (Ukraine)

Director: Mila Pogrebiska

&amp;#x200B;

The story is about ex-prison manager who in order to return to his previous job has a challenge to be director at problematic school. Unlike first 2 films I didn't watch it, as it was in cinemas not for a long time.

But Bitcoin topic is mentioned in trailer. 

At 00:55 you can see the criminal who is asking:

\-- What is Bitcoin, do you know?

\-- Yes, composer

So this short dialogue references to the popular joke (hard to say does this joke has more truth or joke in it) when people mix Bitcoin with Beethoven, music composer.  (Well of course now in certain communities people know what is Bitcoin, but don't know who is Ludwig van Beethoven)

Then (at 00:59) criminal asks ""Did you mine a lot already"" and we see a torture scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

All 3 films are very recent - this year and previous, and of course there might be other films which I'm not aware about. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be depicted more and more in the mass culture.

e1yvsu,Cost to Mine Bitcoin Analysis by Canadian Miner Hut8,"‚Äã‚ÄãHut 8 Mining Corp., one of the world‚Äôs largest public cryptocurrency mining companies by operating capacity and market capitalization, announces its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. It gives a great idea on cost, Revenue, Margins, EBITDA to mine Bitcoin. (Figures in Canadian Dollars.)

**Summary: **
$4.4K cost to mine = $11,353,029 /1950 btc = $5.8K CAD * 0.75 CAD/USD = $4.4K

*If including other expenses;*
Site operating: $11.35M
Depreciation: $4.7M
Expenses: $1.4M
Net finance expenses: $1.1M
Total = $18.6M/1950 = $9.5K CAD * 0.75 CAD/USD = $7.1K USD

The really funny part is, I got the message right after making a stupid joke about being old and using a recliner yesterday. I'm probably old to most people on here, but I'm not really *an old person*. Makes me feel like I was targeted based on the comment I made, but I'm in no way sure that's the case.

Site Pays? : Yes, until mid-December (hurry!)

You can put a minimum of 0.001 BTC in to double. I recommend doing this minimum amount to see that it does double, then doing a larger amount.

Initially, the group started out as a few business associates lightly investing and trading into altcoins back in 2017. It didn‚Äôt take long for us to appreciate the potential of ICO‚Äôs at the time, more so with the group‚Äôs accredited investor status and large capital liquid. Subsequently, our focal point went from trading to investing into ICO private sales (fulfilling discrete BTC/ETH allocation amounts set for us). The pre-sale of ICX was our first investment which yielded over a 10X+ and ever since we‚Äôve dedicated ourselves full-time. Along the way we‚Äôve built a strong base with connections amid big names in the crypto space, opening up many doors for us.

We‚Äôre currently seeking like-minded individuals that we deem recruitment worthy. In return, we can negotiate investment on behalf of our deals and bonuses. Timezone is absolutely not an issue.

Please reach out via PM if interested, we can set up a meeting and go in further detail on who we are and how we operate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e2bb00/bitcoin_network_group/,waoh,1,2019-11-27 05:30:50,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e2bb00/bitcoin_network_group/,NaN

e2ipmh,Traceability of Bitcoin-Transactions / How to stay fully anonymous?,"Hey guys.

I don't really know that much about Bitcoin and got a question, I thought this might be the best place to ask about this.

So I'm planning on finally getting a VPN and have been eyeing Mullvad, which seems to be a very trustable and anonymous Provider. Upon Account-creation you just get a number, that's your whole account: no username, no email, no nothing, just that number. That means not even they can connect your identity with your account.

The only thing that might connect the account and your identity is the payment. To be FULLY anonymous it wouldn't be smart to pay by bank transfer or with your every day PayPal-Account, but luckily they offer to pay with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

As far as I know Bitcoin is just pseudo anonymous, as you can trace back every transaction to the wallets it came from, and at one point in time you had to create an account somewhere with your personal information to even buy Bitcoin in the first place.

Which brings me to my question: Is there any way to stay fully anonymous the whole way, buying and sending Bitcoin?

There are services like [anycoindirect.eu](https://anycoindirect.eu) where you can buy Bitcoin etc. and send them directly to an address you'd like to. (In this case I'd send it to the payment address for the VPN)   
But to do that you have to create an account there with your personal information yada yada yada.  
I guess they have one address where they keep their Bitcoin and send it from this address to wherever. Would this be directly traceable to ones account? Or would this step make the payment of the VPN untraceable to my accountdata on their site? 

Before there arises suspicion: I don't wanna do some highly illegal things, don't worry haha. Most illegal thing would maybe be some torrenting from time to time lol. I just want to be sure that there is no way I can be traced by paying and using this VPN.

Well before I write a whole book I'll keep it at that.. 

Thanks for helping out a cryptodummy :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e2ipmh/traceability_of_bitcointransactions_how_to_stay/,Polyoxi,1,2019-11-27 16:47:10,9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e2ipmh/traceability_of_bitcointransactions_how_to_stay/,NaN

HYPOTHESIS:

Bitcoin will never be a dominant currency because it is too risky for Fortune 500 companies to use. A major company would have to keep billions of dollars in a bitcoin wallet and, presumably, several people at the company would have the keys in order to send payments to vendors and so forth. A Fortune 500 employee with the keys could easily send lots of BTC to a personal, anonymous wallet through coinjoin or some other anonymizing application. The company would have no recourse in this situation.

I still believe BTC is a great tool for individuals, but I don't see it becoming a primary currency for day to day transactions.

A few months back, I released this button as an option to receive **Lightning Network** tips on your **Tippin** account easily: *You sign up at Tippin, you copy the button code &amp; paste it on your web, and you are all set.*   


However, there were some bugs and incompatibilities that should be fixed with this update. Also, now there is a \*Dark mode\*, in case the pink button was a little too much for your web color scheme.  


Here you have a short video showing the new design: [https://twitter.com/tippin\_me/status/1199798669211578368](https://twitter.com/tippin_me/status/1199798669211578368)  
(The updated code is live on Tippin.me)

Hope you enjoy it!

e2pxeg,Bitcoin promotes advances in energy and computation efficiency,"With improved energy efficiency comes reduced energy cost which is better for miners.

With improved computational efficiency comes more hashpower at a reduced cost which is better for miners.

Anything better for miners is better for bitcoin because the network becomes more secure.

Anything better for bitcoin causes bitcoin to become more sought after.

When bitcoin becomes more sought after, more miners try to mine more, and do so in part by increasing their efficiency.

Can you guess the lynchpin here?

Bitcoin has massive security which is the driving force behind its own feedback loop. No other coin comes close to achieving this property. This is why it‚Äôs so important to keep the blockchain small. It‚Äôs the other variable in Bitcoin‚Äôs security equation.

When many people regretted that it was too late to start, a football player found a new way -- to wear the T-shirt advertised by bitcoin to speak for his dream on shaky voice, and successfully won the support of many people.

There are football players wearing clothes with bitcoin logo and QR code, which represents the address of bitcoin wallet. Scan these QR codes, and others can donate money to the wallet. This two-dimensional code has successfully gained a lot of attention in  Tik Tok, and quickly spread throughout the bitcoin community.

Oh man, it's a wild ride! The price discovery process is crazy as usual, but there's all this other interesting stuff happening in the space. The technology just keeps improving every day. Lightning is looking pretty interesting, watchtowers soon, schnorr signatures. 

&gt; ""I saw bitcoin crashed, you doing ok?""

I lost it all, everything, wiped out. Had to sell me car...

...just messing with yah! It's definitely a wild ride for sure, but rolling out new technology like this is never a straight line. One thing I do find pretty interesting though is that the low for the year gets higher, year after year. So while the highs are getting all the headlines and distracting everyone, meanwhile the floor just keeps  on rising.  

&gt; ""Hey, weren't you into bitcoin? Is that still a thing?""

Don't get me started, I'm more excited about this tech than ever. I don't want to talk your ear off so be careful what you wish for. The economics of it are so interesting.

I have a Trezor and Coinbase (I know, I know). I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to receive crypto on my registry. Is there a way to put a QR code on my wix website, or have a public key number, or an even simpler way? Would love some advice!

e3ufge,My 1800 Bitcoin stuck in brainwallet. Moderator mark as fake. I need more input.,"I‚Äôm here seeking for advice. My original post flag as faked. Mostly because my typo of bitaddress.org. I‚Äôm not trying to phishing the website. 

My post even get coverage from cointelegraph.com. Some ‚Äúold timer‚Äù claim it as fake because of the dates etc. Off course I don‚Äôt really give the exact details because I don‚Äôt want to risk someone to steal it (if someone find out the exact address, there‚Äôs risk someone can trace my IP and intrude my MacBook that I belief still storing the keystroke I used to generate the brain wallet). 

But the fact is: 

1. 1800 (plus minus)  still stored in that address. 
2. I used bitaddress.org to create the wallet. 
3. I created 3 address. Stored 1000,1000 and 1800. Managed to recovered first two. But failed to get the 1800z 
4. Off course I tried all common typo including space, caps lock etc (I‚Äôve been trying to retrieve it since January 2018). 

I‚Äôm thinking about forensics expert on the MacBook to retrieve every single data that might be helpful. Or, the most unrealistic is using hypnosis for my brain to travel back on the date I created the wallet. So, I need recommendation If anyone know how to do this method. I‚Äôm willing to travel anywhere to meet in person to do this.

e4gn7d,"PSA (important terminology): when we say we pay ""with lightning"" or ""in lightning"" instead of ""with Bitcoin via / on lightning"" we do ourselves a big disservice as everybody not as knowledgeable as us thinks we are using another currency, not Bitcoin.","I came to realize this problem now over the last few months taking payments via the LN at our bar ROOM77 in Berlin. The amount of people from outside of the community who have by now asked me what the new lightning currency is all about is staggering and we even had staff members who took LN payments for quite a while without having understood that they are actually accepting Bitcoin.

Accordingly we have aksed our staff not to ask our customers ""do you want to pay with Bitcoin or with Lightning?"" and instead offer the choice of ""Bitcoin onchain or via the Lightning Network?"".

I think by not using the right wording we are creating unneccessary confusion amongst all the bystanders and noobs and at the same time playing into the hands of the people selling fake bitcoins and claiming that bitcoins on the LN are not actually bitcoins.

Thanks for considering this wording suggestion or using your own as long as it avoids the confusion desribed above!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4gn7d/psa_important_terminology_when_we_say_we_pay_with/,joecoin,1,2019-12-01 12:06:43,37,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4gn7d/psa_important_terminology_when_we_say_we_pay_with/,NaN

**Forecast: BTC/USD is on its way from apx $7300 to apx $6300.**

Renko charts are designed to filter out minor price movements to make it easier for traders to focus on important trends. While this makes trends much easier to spot, the downside is that some price information is lost due to simple brick construction of Renko charts.

e4r0hb,Please stop comparing Bitcoin to fiat,"I am getting tired of repeating myself so here's to hoping I can reach a broader audience assuming this doesn't get downvoted into oblivion.

If you read articles like this- https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1

You are fundamentally misunderstanding money.

The entire purpose of money is to facilitate trade.  It is not desired to be an asset that appreciates in value.

If money continued to increase in value over time, people would spend less of it.  This would lead to less active markets (higher volatility).  Business incomes would decline (--&gt; layoffs --&gt; unemployment goes up) as people decide to spend less because their money will be worth more tomorrow.  Consumption goes down, revenues decline, companies go out of business, unemployment goes up and up and we end up in a deflationary spiral that is unstoppable.  This eventually leads to a depression, bread lines, nationalization of industry, and war.  Yes, War.

It is NOT DESIRABLE for money to increase in value.  We want people to spend money.  Constantly.  Keep those markets going.  More trade.  More trade.  Buy bonds, buy stocks, buy fuckin candy bars, whatever, just spend your money.  Keep trade going.  That is the entire purpose of money - to facilitate fucking trade.

Yet here we are.  In the HODLverse where everyone thinks that it's a good idea to have money that continually increases in value while they chant ""HODL"" which is literally what I just described - a massive decline in trade.

Bitcoin is a commodity.  It is an investment.  Like gold, or oil, or muni bonds, or treasuries, or a million other things.  Those are the comparisons you should make.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4r0hb/please_stop_comparing_bitcoin_to_fiat/,mobile-user-guy,1,2019-12-02 00:57:00,19,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4r0hb/please_stop_comparing_bitcoin_to_fiat/,NaN

e4w14l,Bitcoin prediction and the CCP thought.,"So the Chinese seem to be tossing in a ‚Äúwe like blockchain‚Äù obstacle To BTC adoption.  This to me is a sign that that the CCP would like to divert Chinese attention away from real crypto.  This blow coincides at a time when some miners (I assume) are cashing out due to their razor thin margins and their calculation of what a halving would mean for future profits.   If a run up occurs as a result of decreased flow of new bitcoins, the vacuum of miners (assumed) would create a huge strain on transaction speeds.  The lack of speed and the introduction of a state owned crypto that is faster could give pause to many would be Chinese adopters of real crypto.  If you were the Chinese, wouldn‚Äôt you love the idea of creating fiat crypto from thin air and exchanging it for non fiat Crypto?  I‚Äôm reminded of the forced ejection from silver backed dollars in the face of worthless fiat that occurred 40 something years ago.  I think the Chinese have that part of history earmarked in their playbook.  So, two things could precipitate. I would think:  The Chines people or the CCP could dump their BTC purchased by the new flow of Chinese crypto at that point OR they could flush out the crypto market in China to a large extent, taking demand way down at a crucial time .  Does the CCP have their people totally dialed in that well?  Am I making too many assumptions about how they would use a state backed Crypto?  Am I selling the Chinese people short.  Pardon the pun.  Maybe the Chinese will release their new currency just weeks before the halving?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4w14l/bitcoin_prediction_and_the_ccp_thought/,chadcansell,1,2019-12-02 08:14:17,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4w14l/bitcoin_prediction_and_the_ccp_thought/,NaN

The only thing I notice is a bit of speculation about the price and various imitation attempts made, above all, to speculate on the price of coins and tokens.

Indeed, I see danger on the horizon: the States are trying to push the population towards the elimination of paper cash in favor of ""modern"" forms of payment. This will eliminate the privacy of all of us citizens and will excessively earn the banks that will receive commissions for every monetary transaction.

In practice, the only use of the blockchain that I see at the horizon will be detrimental to us private citizens.

e53r7s,Financial Uncertainties and The Eurasia Debt May Welcome A Bulls for Bitcoin," The financial industry is currently seeking to integrate the new financial technology with the traditional financial tech. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that serve as a digital asset globally. Speculators believe that a bull market trend for BTC will necessitate a universally neutral reserve asset.  


Rona Foroohar, an associate editor and columnist at Financial Times, recently published an opinion article on the ‚Äúgold bugs,‚Äù which attracted comments from central bankers and investors. Foroohar wrote that for investors to hoard physical bars in the new digital financial world, they have to strongly believe that that the sky is falling.  


The columnist attributes the ‚Äúgold bug‚Äù to the urgencies welcomed by mild geopolitical fears, and the post-2008 horizon, which she believes was systematically fragile.  


The Dutch Central Bank issues a warning in October that if the system fails or witnesses a monetary reset, gold would be the go-to solution to rebuild the system. There is a sense of security in gold due to the stability of the DCB‚Äôs balance, which gold bolsters have high confidence in.  


According to Ray Dalio, speaking at a conference at the Institute for International Finance, there is a likelihood that gold would save the situation if America‚Äôs creditors betrayed the signs of edginess.  


Jamie Dimon, the Chief at JPMorgan, and Stanley Druckenmiller, fund manager, had warned back in 2016 that there was an unsustainable financial situation due to unfunded healthcare and pension entitlements in the U.S.  


The U.S Dollar is at the risk of depreciating due to fiscal imbalances, which have led to inflated balance sheets and low-interest rates. Such a situation would scare off investors from holding the USD nor federal debts.  


She points out that there is a need to develop an asset that is no one‚Äôs liability. These words from Foroohar meant gold or any other independent asset.  


Recently, China edged away from petrodollar when it Issued its pioneer Eurobond in fifteen years. Eurasia is gradually de-dollarizing, and this is so critical that it would force the U.S to sell USD in an effort to settle the balance of payments in the country.  


However, the co-founder of Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, Cameron Winklevoss, has an opinion contrary to Dalio‚Äôs. Winklevoss believes that Bitcoin holds a solution that is not confined to being a ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù or a safe-haven digital asset. Winklevoss had also forecast that Bitcoin will break gold‚Äôs market cap of $7 trillion.

e59h2h,LET THIS SINK IN: There aren't enough BTC for HALF of today's millionaires to own JUST ONE. Owning ONE bitcoin puts you--at minimum--in the top 0.2% of the human population in terms of total possible Bitcoin wealth distribution.,"There will only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. Ever. Approximately 4 million have been permanently [LOST](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/), bringing the maximum circulating total to 17 million. This total number won't be reached until 2140 due to Bitcoin's [issuance schedule](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply).

Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/22/12-million-new-millionaires-will-be-minted-over-the-next-five-years.html)).

The math is simple: there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for even HALF of today's millionaires to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN. Much less all the future millionaires that will be born as the human population approaches [10bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population).

Bitcoin is SCARCE. Check out the [S2F model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) for a good explanation of why scarcity and value correlate.

Furthermore: If you are able to acquire even one BTC today: Enjoy the feeling. You are an early adopter. And one of a **very** select number of humans. Owning just ONE BTC means that you are--at minimum--in the top 0.2% ([17M / 8Bn \* 100](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=(17,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)) of the human population in terms of total possible bitcoin wealth distribution.

Edit: And never-mind the idiots that will say something asinine like ""my pubic hairs are limited in number too...does that make them valuable?"" Your pubic hairs have zero utility, whereas every day Bitcoin proves it has extraordinary utility as (perhaps) the most perfect form of money humans have yet created.

e5fh5m,Evading financial censorship - Bitcoin got me some 3d printer parts that my bank wouldn't let me order.,"Was trying to order some parts from Prusa - if you don't know them, they are a very reputable manufacturer of 3d printers. They produce one of, if not the best desktop FDM 3d printer, and have a list of awards as long as my arm. I've ordered stuff many times from them with my card before, the printer itself along with various upgrades and supplies. They have a very good reputation. It's not like I'm trying to buy stuff off Silk road here.

This time, I tried to order some new upgrades, and secure 3d came up saying that my bank thought the transaction was suspicious and that they may send me a text. They never sent me a text, the transaction got blocked.

Guessing my bank doesn't like Prusa for some reason (maybe because they are from Prague?) - went back to payment methods and noticed they accept Bitcoin. [It certainly wasn't an out of character transaction for me](https://imgur.com/a/ziX6i2t). Paid and it cleared within a few minutes, parts are on the way.

e5g3vm,The TRUTH about Bitcoin!,"Satoshi‚Äôs decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin is most likely based on the global M1 money supply which stands at approximately $21 trillion.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Every dollar can be divided into 100 cents, making the total number of pieces of money to exist at around 2,100 trillion.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar to the cents for a dollar, a Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 100 million Satoshis in each Bitcoin, which means there will only ever be 2,100 trillion, the same number as the global M1 supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, Bitcoin is well suited to replace all fiat currencies and has the ability to act as a global currency.

&amp;#x200B;

The supply schedule of Bitcoin is 140 years, from 2008 to 2148.

&amp;#x200B;

Once all Bitcoin are mined, miners will continue to be paid in transaction fees.

&amp;#x200B;

In the 40 year period from 2008 to 2048, 99.9% of all Bitcoin will be mined.

&amp;#x200B;

In the 100 year period from 2048 to 2148, only 20,507.8119 BTC will be mined.

&amp;#x200B;

The same amount of BTC will be mined in the 4 year period from 2020 to 2024 as the 124 years from 2024 to 2148.

&amp;#x200B;

e5i5dp,Stolen bitcoin - advice please,"Throwaway account because I'm an idiot.

I sold a small amount of BTC on localbitcoins(.)com to a third party.

He said the payment would take a bit of time as the bank had to manually confirm the transactions but that would take longer than the Localbitcoins time frame to complete the transaction. He got the coin, I didn't get the money. He's not talking to me now. 

I get it, I'm an idiot. I've spoken to my bank but they can't help. I contacted Localbitcoins.com and they have banned the user, but that's where I run out of ideas.

Is there anything else I can do to recover the money or BTC? 

Police? Debt recovery? Court action? Something else?

e5lxm7,Bitcoin as salvation,"At the moment, the Bitcoin exchange rate is $ 7400. However, in Venezuela, the price of bitcoin approached $ 9,800. This situation with cryptocurrencies clearly reflects the current economic situation in the country, where there is an acute shortage of cash. Watching how money turns into dust, the population wisely transferred their funds to cryptocurrency. Despite warnings that Bitcoin could turn out to be a bubble, locals are prepared to take risks. In the eyes of consumers, cryptocurrencies look like a salvation from fear of loss of funds and protection from financial collapse. The black market of US dollars is running all over the streets of the capital. The country is facing problems of hyperinflation, similar to that which occurred in the early 20th century in Germany. ‚ÄúI transferred all my savings to bitcoins, because this is the only way to save them,‚Äù says Enrique Lopez, who works for an IT company in the capital of Venezuela. Many investors do not trust Bitcoin, not indicating its high volatility and frequent speculation. For residents of Venezuela, where the severe economic crisis lasts for a year, cryptocurrency, despite all its disadvantages, has become more important than ordinary money. Today, Venezuelans use bitcoins to make purchases in foreign stores and transfer funds abroad. They can also buy ordinary goods, such as clothing and products.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5lxm7/bitcoin_as_salvation/,IRedditGirlI,1,2019-12-03 19:10:28,10,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5lxm7/bitcoin_as_salvation/,NaN

e5rvv9,Just published: KEYS to BITCOIN,"Hi everyone,

I just published my ebook on Amazon, ""[KEYS to BITCOIN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0829D91VX)"", so yeah, I am very excited!

But seriously, this is the blurb: 

""*What is Bitcoin? How does it work? In this book you will find answers that go beyond the headlines.*¬†

*Whether you are an investor, a decision maker, or simply¬†curious about Bitcoin, you will learn the key concepts behind the digital money: the blockchain, miners, digital signatures, and much more.¬†Step by step, example by example. You do not need a Math degree to understand Bitcoin; this book will take you from not knowing anything about crypto-currencies to understanding Bitcoin completely: all the technologies used, why they are being used and how. It includes chapters on how to buy and store bitcoins, how Bitcoin is updated, and the newest evolutions in sight, such as the Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures. If you want to understand the evolution and revolution of digital currencies, this book is for you*.""

So, I hope you read the book, it's a pretty long and dense read, but hopefully worth your time. You can get a free sample from the Amazon website. Enjoy!

e5uy9x,Peter Schiff once said Gold Money would kill bitcoin. Now Gold Money is dead proving once again that the only viable global sound monetary system will be a completely decentralized one.,"In this most recent [Podcast](https://youtu.be/-wamx4HHs2w) at  50:40:00 Peter Schiff talks about the fact that Gold Money has had to start charging storage fees on their accounts of $10 per month just to cover regulatory burdens. This has made small accounts less than a few thousand dollars impractical which has caused Gold Money to have to completely change their business model.

Gold Money were originally trying to make gold usable in commerce as a medium of exchange via a bank account and gold backed debit card. Peter Schiff has always said that this one company would kill bitcoin because gold as a medium of exchange is better than bitcoin. Our argument however was always that Gold Money would never work because it was centralized and at the mercy of regulatory suffocation where bitcoin is decentralized and can survive no matter how much regulatory burden exists. 

The fact that Gold Money could not do what it set out to do shows once again that a decentralized protocol for money is the only system that can work long term and that backing a crypto token with gold just brings it back to being centralized again.  Bitcoin so long as it is algorithmically scarce does not need gold backing to make it scarce. Bitcoin is the only logical way forward for a global sound monetary system.

Peter Schiff stated he will take over where Gold Money left off and his centralized company will do what they couldn't starting next year. What is the definition of insanity again? Trying the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result.

Per the above story, Terpin was using Google Authenticator:  

""Mr. Terpin believes employees at an AT&amp;T authorized dealer handed hackers control of his phone number, and those hackers found a way into his digital wallets by breaking into accounts of his that couldn‚Äôt be protected by Authenticator.

‚ÄúOn a scale of 1 to 10, I‚Äôd say my security protections were a 9.8 or higher,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut these hackers, all they do is they sit around in a basement and figure out ways of hacking people.‚Äù""

The first lesson is to not leave $24 million in hot storage, but if you're in the process of buying or selling bitcoin for fiat online you will eventually be somewhat vulnerable.  So I'm wondering, how would a hacker get into say a Binance or Coinbase account of someone who has Google Authenticator enabled (which both support)?  The only way I can think is that the hacker would impersonate Terpin and contact Binance/Coinbase and say they lost their phone and need to recover the account.  I believe this method takes several days at least during which Terpin would know his phone was stolen and he'd be able to at least call Binance/Coinbase and tell them to freeze his account.

In addition to run bots to evaluate and post general 4chan and reddit crypto sentiment about once a week, my Twitter account will now also automatically retweet any BTC related tweet made by a verified account with &gt;1m followers.

This is an easy way to catch major Bitcoin news, mentions and celebrity involvement.

The twitter handle also retweets  ETH, LTC or XMR related tweets (if by verified account with &gt;1m followers). I hope this doesn't get this post removed...

Let me know if you notice any issues or have any questions. Apologies if there some problems in the beginning, I'm only doing this as a hobby.

Enjoy and let me know your feedback!

e6oe9w,Finally back into Bitcoin after I ruined my life.,"In 2017 I was 4 years out of college without a full-time job driving Uber. I got into Bitcoin right after China ""banned"" it(4-5k). I grew disillusioned with myself. Because I still didn't have a full-time job and had no money my mind-set was gamble gamble gamble until I have at least $500,000 because I thought I would never get a full-time job. Big mistake. I gambled(by trading altcoins) everything away. 

Earlier this year I was in more than 40k of debt and still no full-time job. I saw Bitcoin moon. I got depressed. A couple of weeks after Bitcoin peaked at 14k , I got a full-time job. Last month I fomo out the dip. I bought 1.66667 Bitcoin at about $7350 each. I had more than 10 during the bubble. But I learned my lesson! 

Hold, don't trade shitcoins, and don't buy 30k of bitcoin on credit cards.

e6pqe7,Trying to sell my bitcoin! Noob question.,"Hey guys, 

So a few years back when bitcoin was dirt cheap (I think), I purchased something from South Asia and had it shipped to the United States. It wasn't necessarily legal, however not dangerous by any means. I used CoinBase (app) as a wallet to purchase the goods. Almost immediately after buying the holograms, my CoinBase account was shut down due to illegal purchases. Okay, fine. I only had a few bucks left in there due to a poor conversion of how much I really needed. 

 

Fast forward 7 years into the future, the few dollars turned into $80! How did I find out? Apparently CoinBase still had my account in purgatory and was ready to close it the whole time, but I needed to transfer my funds to another wallet. So I do that, I now have the app BRD. As you can tell, I'm VERY naive when it comes to bitcoin and actually decent wallets. What I'm trying to do is take this $80 back and keep it. I need to find a way to sell this bitcoin! The app that I'm using now allows for you to sell it to them, however I cannot link my bank account due to it being a local smaller one. It worked with CoinBase, but not here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically can someone help a clueless guy out to get some beer money? Things have been tight lately and I shit you not, this currency was meant to be a gift from the beer gods themselves.

e6q2iv,Bitcoin core data use,"Running two Raspiblitzs (which obviously means I'm running two full nodes). Chewing through 120gb of bandwidth a month. Hoping to reduce a bit.

Question is: what is best for my node, and what is best for the ecosystem more generally (I'm not totally selfish in this situation - want to help out new nodes by having connections).

Suppose I‚Äôm using my games &amp; torrents &amp; porn &amp; browser-addons computer and visit a website that sells something for bitcoin. And suppose I‚Äôm using a separated clean android device for my bitcoin, and even use a hardware wallet connected to it.
How can I tell if a virus simply replaced the bitcoin address in the website that I‚Äôm viewing?
Is there a 3rd party to actually verify this?
It could be great if my Android payment app could automatically say ‚ÄúThe address you are about to pay to belongs to www.somebitcoinstore.com‚Äù or warn me if it does not.

e6ybqa,SEED Madagascar - international development charity accepting bitcoin,"Hey everyone,

I'm Zoe and I volunteer for an amazing charity called SEED Madagascar (more about us below)... we now accept bitcoin and are really excited to potentially receive much needed donations we may not otherwise receive and to connect with new types of supporters. 

I'd also love to connect with other charitable organisations and service providers out there that are accepting bitcoin!?! 

If you're feeling generous this giving season, any donation will be very much appreciated! I've included a link to the bitcoin donation page on our website but please have a browse of our website and take a look at our programmes.

I've also set up a fundraising campaign, Project Fanaka, on the Helperbit site to fund raise for a desk and bench construction project designed to provide schools in a remote region in Madagascar with comfortable and adequate school furniture... check it out here...

[https://app.helperbit.com/project/5de1406af13ffd3fe2e94ecb/project-fanaka-a-desk-and-bench-construction-project-designed-to-provide-schools-in-and-around-fort-dauphin-in-the-anosy-region-of-south-east-madagascar-with-comfortable-and-adequate-school-furniture](https://app.helperbit.com/project/5de1406af13ffd3fe2e94ecb/project-fanaka-a-desk-and-bench-construction-project-designed-to-provide-schools-in-and-around-fort-dauphin-in-the-anosy-region-of-south-east-madagascar-with-comfortable-and-adequate-school-furniture) 

So, more about SEED... an award-winning, holistic international development charity that envisages¬†communities and ecosystems thriving across Madagascar. Our central mission is to enhance the¬†capacity of individuals, communities, organisations and government in fulfilling sustainable¬†environment, education and development goals in southeast Madagascar.

We achieve this by working across four departments to respond to the most critical and express¬†needs of the country: community health, education infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, and¬†environmental conservation.

Our approach is based on partnership, co-management and skill-sharing with individuals,¬†communities, local organisations, and governments. The programmes that result lead to lasting¬†change, alleviating poverty and supporting environmental conservation for some of the world's most¬†vulnerable people in threatened and irreplaceable environments, measurably contributing to the¬†UN's Sustainable Development Goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e6ybqa/seed_madagascar_international_development_charity/,zoejames49,1,2019-12-06 12:47:22,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e6ybqa/seed_madagascar_international_development_charity/,NaN

e6ye31,Quick question about withdrawing cash from bitcoin atms,"Cross post from r/BitcoinUK

Before you ask - I have used the search bar.

People have stated that the rates are terrible for buying and selling on a bitcoin atm machine. Checked the local bitcoin atms in London using radar map and I must say buying is a rip off, but how about selling? Especially Shitcoin's selling exchange rate looks reasonable, very close or even higher than the current price. What am I missing here?

[Example 1](https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/6614/bitcoin-atm-shitcoins-club-london-uk-elephant-and-castle-shopping-centre/) .
[Example 2](https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/7142/bitcoin-atm-shitcoins-club-london-uk-west-one-shopping-centre/) .
[Example 3 - Worst case scenario for me](https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/6658/bitcoin-atm-general-bytes-london-uk-the-moon-house/)
&gt; Current price (06/12/2019) of 1 btc on google: ¬£5603

&gt; Buying price of the machine: ¬£6493.33

&gt; Selling: ¬£5790.59

I need to convert my 200&gt; quid worth of bitcoin into cash (am not interested in the holding part). Tried localbitcoins but for some reason (seriously) they didn't accept my ID even though it was extremely clean, no blur, everything is normal but they didn't accept it so I am trying to cash out my bitcoins in another way. I am happy to scan my ID in a bitcoin machine if it asks, (should I though?)

Someone has suggested attending bitcoin meetings, literally I have no idea how I am going to tell people that I am selling bitcoins. Do I HODL a sign in my hand or wear a coin costume?

Any suggestion is appreciated.

ORIGINAL POST :

Hi everyone,

I just published my ebook on Amazon, ""[KEYS to BITCOIN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0829D91VX)"", so yeah, I am very excited!

But seriously, this is the blurb:

""*What is Bitcoin? How does it work? In this book you will find answers that go beyond the headlines.* 

*Whether you are an investor, a decision maker, or simply¬†curious about Bitcoin, you will learn the key concepts behind the digital money: the blockchain, miners, digital signatures, and much more.¬†Step by step, example by example. You do not need a Math degree to understand Bitcoin; this book will take you from not knowing anything about crypto-currencies to understanding Bitcoin completely: all the technologies used, why they are being used and how. It includes chapters on how to buy and store bitcoins, how Bitcoin is updated, and the newest evolutions in sight, such as the Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures. If you want to understand the evolution and revolution of digital currencies, this book is for you*.""

So, I hope you read the book, it's a pretty long and dense read, but hopefully worth your time. You can get a free sample from the Amazon website. Enjoy!

e7cpfb,Can't mine? Run a Bitcoin full node + GIMPS to find Mersenne Primes (there's a $3000-reward but that shouldn't be the prime reason).,"[What Is A Full Node?](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node)

&gt;A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.

Why you should run a Bitcoin full node is a no brainer, so onto GIMPS: the **Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search**. Among plenty of good reasons, the following one resonates with Bitcoin. 

[Why participate in GIMPS?](https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Why_participate_in_GIMPS%3F) 

* **People collect rare and beautiful items.**

&gt;Mersenne primes, which are usually the largest known primes, are both rare and beautiful. Since Euclid initiated the search for and study of Mersennes approximately 300 BC, very few have been found. Just 51 in all of human history - that is rare!  
&gt;  
&gt;But they are also beautiful. Mathematics, like all fields of study, has a its own notion of beauty. What qualities are perceived as beautiful in mathematics? Mathematicians look for proofs that are short, concise, clear, and if possible that combine previous disparate concepts or teach you something new. Mersennes have one of the simplest possible forms for primes, **2****^(P)****-1**. The proof of their primality has an elegant simplicity (to a mathematician). Mersennes are beautiful and have some surprising applications.

* Least importantly, the cash $3000 reward: [https://www.mersenne.org/legal/#awards](https://www.mersenne.org/legal/#awards).

Surprisingly, *Ben Delo*, the co-founder of *BitMEX*, is also looking for Mersenne Primes: [https://www.mersenne.org/report\_top\_teams\_ll/](https://www.mersenne.org/report_top_teams_ll/), [https://www.mersenne.org/report\_top\_500\_ll/](https://www.mersenne.org/report_top_500_ll/). He's or they've only been at it for a few months and already surpassed everyone at Lucas-Lehmer first primality testing.

Anyway, I hope some of you will join me in this quest of finding Mersenne Primes while running their Bitcoin full node. Don't just post memes and hope the price will go up, do something about it. Support the network or [contribute code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin); the price will follow the value of the network.

Right now all I‚Äôm doing is HODLING, resenting Conbase and checking the subreddit /Bitcoin every day just waiting for an opportunity to do something more. It‚Äôs frustrating.

e7qo5o,Do you honestly believe bitcoin would ever replace banks.,"This was a question that /u/Tew_Wet asked me on another comment and I felt I should make a post about it. Before 2018 it looked like Bitcoin was going to take over the world in only a few years. Now there are a lot of skeptical people that fear Bitcoin or lost a lot ""investing"" in Bitcoin and are scared to get involved again. People don't understand that Bitcoin is meant to be used as a monetary system to make you free. Most people think that it is a get quick rich scheme that won't work anymore. I don't think people care enough about their personal freedom or privacy in life or money. I think that something can or will some day replace banks and this is the starting foundation to it all. 

I trust Bitcoin and it gave me something money never could and that was freedom. A major problem that I see to Bitcoin is the hodl mentality. In order to get Bitcoin to rise in popularity we need it to be used as a currency. The best use case that I see for Bitcoin is to replace Western Union and all money transfer services which could mean banks but there will still always be a need for loans. It is cheaper and faster and safer to send crypto internationally over any other option. The only people that were using it as a currency were the dark web guys and now there is so many problems with that I think usage is probably slowing down there too. 

We need to get more Bitcon awareness out there. We need more people to adopt and use Bitcoin, move Bitcoin around using it as a currency. A major problem I see is that people always have an excuse for not using bitcoin and what it comes down to for real is that Bitcoin is too hard for them to learn. But what it really comes down to for real is they are too lazy to learn about Bitcoin and automatically assume, Bitcoin, Computers, it's too hard for me and they never look into it at all. For Bitcoin to be adopted us as a community need to do more to show Bitcoin to the world and make people understand.

Q. Do I honestly believe that Bitcoin could replace banks.

e7qznv,Does Bitcoin have an anthem?,"OK, you can write your ""Cringe"" comment below.

I was thinking about the historical and symbolic value that bitcoin has and no other altcoin will ever have - being the first cryptocurrency. Symbols like flags and national anthems have powerful meaning for the masses - millions have died for what they thought they represent, even though those symbols can represent something a little bit different for each individual.

Bitcoin already has the famous B icon. I think it should have an anthem. Not a pop-song, but a real serious anthem, with carefully chosen lyrics and rhythm. The European union has an anthem - representing many countries with one currency, and so did the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. Even the boy scouts have an anthem.

I'm not a native english speaker, but I would agree that the Bitcoin anthem should be written in English, because this is the language its creators used to communicate. I would add some words in Japanese because Satoshi definitely had some empathy to the Japanese culture. How do you say in Japanese ""not-your-keys-not-your-coins is our motto""?

I know this has probably been asked a dozen times already. But I‚Äôm not talking about using quantum computers to break the encryptions behind bitcoin - it‚Äôs impossible to do so with current technology, and by the time quantum computers can break bitcoin encryption, bitcoin would likely have upgraded to become quantum-resistant, anyway. 


Rather, I am talking about using quantum computers to mine bitcoin. If quantum computers can theoretically outperform classical ones, shouldn‚Äôt they be able to mine bitcoin at a significantly faster rate than usual? In addition, is it possible to do so with current quantum computer technology (like, for example, some guy uses IBM‚Äôs 53-qubit computer or Google‚Äôs 72-qubit Sycamore chip to do the job)?

I have the ability to use bitcoin to pay for a wedding band in July of 2020 which saves us 3% transaction fee by not using FIAT. Do I buy now and hold until payment?

e7vsia,What does success in 2020 for BTC look like for you personally? (not related to the Bitcoin Protocol or Lightning Network Improvements),"Obviously there is a lot of adoption or features that people want to see over the long term. To keep this thread less technically involved, I'm hoping to avoid those more technical topics.

For me personally there are several factors that will make 2020 successful.

* Zero Network Downtime
* Halving #3 without major market distress
* New ATH before 11:59PM EST December 31 2020, though only marginally higher (Somewhere around 20-25K)
* BTC trading at a greater than 1 to 50 ratio for all shitcoin hardforks combined (Meaning BCH + BSV = Less than or equal to 2% of BTC value)
* Marketshare of BTC vs. All Alts exceeds 70% consistently and breaks 80%.
* Major retailer with brick and mortar establishments accepts Lightning Transactions successfully &amp; instantaneously. . . in such a manner that an outlet like CNBC doesn't a short piece on it showing instant BTC transactions that are accepted without any sort of wait. Such as a Starbucks. Key is it isn't an obscure location or brand, and that it is demonstrated as instantly accepted.
* End 2020 with more BTC than I started with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e7vsia/what_does_success_in_2020_for_btc_look_like_for/,foxyjim99,1,2019-12-08 16:34:39,20,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e7vsia/what_does_success_in_2020_for_btc_look_like_for/,NaN

e7xmaa,Is it too late to get into bitcoin?,"Hey guys,

My name is Amara (20ish year old)  and I‚Äôm considering getting into bitcoin. I heard about bitcoin like six years ago when a friend of mine told me about it and tried to convince me to buy some. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt listen to him. 

Two years ago I tried investing into crypto but I didn‚Äôt make any money nor did I lose some. I guess I wasn‚Äôt investing for the right reasons anyway. 

A year ago I ‚Äûwoke up‚Äú and realized in what a shitty condition the global economy and financial systems all around the globe are and I started to invest in ‚Äûreal‚Äú stuff like gold and silver. 

Now I am asking myself if I should invest into bitcoin or any crypto at all to be prepared for what the future might bring. I have a feeling that the next decade is going to be the ‚Äûdecade of crypto‚Äú and it might be smart to put some money towards it. 

But honestly I feel a little bit like I already missed out and it‚Äôs too late to get into bitcoin. Does it make a whole lot of sense to buy like 0.1 bitcoin? Or has bitcoin become an asset for rich people only by now?

I do have a Ledger Nano S and I‚Äôm ready to invest but I‚Äôd love to get some advice and feedback on how much I should invest for it to even make sense. Like is $1000 a good amount? Or is it way too less? Because I feel like it is way too little money to even get started. 

I would really love to get some feedback. 

Lots of love

e8ax89,Best way to setup a Bitcoin cold wallet (storage) - Thoughts?,"Hello.

So, there's just too much information online regarding the wallets topic so I decided to post it around here as I think this is a good place to have an answer that can help a lot more people. It's the central point in crypto and I find it hard to get to an actual answer.

What I used to do was download the web page of a random key pair generator ([bitadress.org](https://bitadress.org)), move that to an offline only laptop, run it and then broadcasting a transaction to it. I played with it a bit and it was ok, but I now need something more secure to store BTC and I think there might be a better way to do it then what I explained. What I want is the most secure method of creating your keys and storing your crypto.

**Paper wallets?** 

**Hardware wallets ?** As far as I know Ledger's code is not open source so no one is 100% what's there. Not sure about Trezor either.

**Desktop wallets?** Not even an option, since you don't really know what's on that code.

How are the most knowledgeable people in crypto storing the assets?!

e8gl3q,"Running Bitcoin: Epic Collection of Practical Bitcoin Tools, Apps and Guides","The Bitcoin community is difficult to create content for, since there are already so many incredible content creators and curators who have covered quite a lot of territory.

When deciding how I could best serve the community, it occurred to me that I hadn't noticed any curated lists focusing on practical application of Bitcoin. There's always a ton of content *about* Bitcoin, and countless tools apps and guides for using such.

So, I scoured the Bitcoin topic on Github, Awesome Lists, and spent a ton of time on [lopp.net](https://lopp.net) over the past 6 months.

I started by making a couple webpages to concentrate these resources. A page one for Layer-One, and a page for Lightning Network.

Theeen, I inputted all of those sources into a spreadsheet, to make it more accessible and easier for others to build upon. One tab for Bitcoin, one tab for Lightning.

I find myself thinking a lot about the fact that Bitcoin isn't really a currency as much as a method of currency--as it were--and that we are possibly giving it *real* value by using energy to keep it going, by sacrificing resources for it, etc. I also wonder how this is any different from paper money.

e8p4tz,Is Bitcoin failing on its main objective?,"I've been looking for ways to store/send/receive bitcoins independently and other than operating a full node myself it seems there isnt a way to do it. 

Bitcoins main goal was to provide decentralised money and the ability to send/receive it without the need for a third party. But atm third parties like coinbase, electrum, armory etc etc are required. Running a full node is clearly unrealistic for regular users, so this means users are still bound to 3rd parties.

I dont mean to single electrum out here, but after googling a little bit I see numerous hacks on electrum that have resulted in lots of lost BTC for its users. 

Personally I wouldnt feel secure holding large amounts of bitcoins in a wallet that is operated by any third party, be that electrum, trezor, coinbase or any other, as you can never know when a clever hacker might come up with something that results in you losing some or all of your coins.

Of course if I had control of my own coins, I would need to keep them safe from attackers myself, but at least that would be my own responsibility and fault if they were lost/stolen. I would much rather lose my coins because of an error that I'd made, than going online 1 day, learning that my third party wallet provider has been hacked and all my coins are gone.

Are we solely relying on price increase of that magnitude that it actually makes sense to mine a few hundred dollar transaction? (meaning you get the transaction fee?)

What are mining fees like these days anyway?  Are miners looking at the possibility of 1% annualized returns?

This does not seem like much incentive - unless there's a ton of transactions.  Given the Store of Value narrative - i'm not sure that will happen.

e8z149,The Federal Reserve's plan with Bitcoin,"[Chico Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dW549Ohkxo&amp;t=3s) from Youtube has been exposing truths behind Bakkt as Bakkt has been reluctant to provide a public custodian address where the funds will be held. A notable name Chico Crypto mentioned was Glenn Hutchins, a Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, former adviser to President Clinton, and one of the biggest drivers behind the Lightning Network. Glenn is also in the Board of Directors at AT&amp;T.

This inspired me to research into what the future may HODL for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Glenn Hutchins' connections to Bakkt comes through ICE's partnership with Blockstream. Blockstream is the developer of The Lightning Network. Glenn Hutchins made a speech at Coindesk in 2016 [""Why Bitcoin Still Matters""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfSCCRHL4xc) 

I was shocked Glenn even spoke publicly on Bitcoin. He addresses the Lightning Network in this speech as fast, cheap, and transformative. The most notable points he made was:

""1. Providing the consumer or enterprise with a very simple technology that ***doesn't require them to figure out Bitcoin technologies***.

2. Giving consumers or enterprises something that works very quickly at very low cost and will have ***a massive opportunity in terms of profit pools*** that are available.

3. It is really important for this industry to embrace regulation for two reasons:

* Banks, deposit-taking institutions, and other parts of the financial services infrastructure will continue to be for a very long time period necessary for the Bitcoin ecosystem to work.
* Being able to work inside the framework of the legal and regulatory systems and the countries is going to be critical to being successful. The technology needs to work within the know your customer anti-money laundering anti-terrorism OFAT kind of control system, and ***if we get that right the consumers benefit right***. And if we get the regulatory environment right and also embrace Bitcoin technology for what it can do this is an industry that can be transformative in our lives **both commercially and personally**.""

Glenn also claims *to own a lot of bitcoin*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Moving onto Bakkt, the following is a breakdown of their investors: Boston Consulting Group, Horizons Ventures Limited, Microsoft, and Naspers

&amp;#x200B;

The current CEO of Boston Consulting Group is Rich Lesser. In December 2016, [Lesser joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-strategic-and-policy-forum-includes-dimon-iger-schwarzman-2016-12) to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Horizons Ventures Limited includes early investors in Google Deep Mind, Dollar Shave Club, and Siri

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft has been developing blockchain solutions through Azure. Microsoft is a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and also chairs the Token Taxonomy Initiative that created the token framework. [Microsoft and Enjin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/azureheroes) have collaborated in a local pilot to create a blockchain based recognition programme on the Ethereum public blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

Pantera Capital - investments include Bakkt, Bitstamp, Brave, Ripple, Shapeshift, Zcash, 0x Protocol, Enigma, Kyber, OmiseGo, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Naspers - owner of PayU and largest **owner of Tencent Holdings Limited, the parent company of WeChat**

&amp;#x200B;

ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) - CEO is Jeffrey Sprecher, **husband of Bakkt CEO - Jeffrey Sprecher is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange**

&amp;#x200B;

Kelly Loeffler is the **CEO of Bakkt - new Republican Senator of Georgia 2019**, been seeking the Republican nomination since 2014 US Senate election in Georgia.

&amp;#x200B;

Johnnny Isakson preceded Kelly Loeffler as the Georgia Senator for 15 years. Johnny Isakson's political stance about the Environment, Healthcare, and Immigration is as follows:

In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about the Keystone Pipeline on January 21, 2015, he voted against Amendment 87 by Senator John Hoeven that climate change is real and human activity contributes to climate change, and against Amendment 58 by Senator Brian Schatz, that human activity ""significantly"" contributes to climate change. In 2015, he voted against the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.

Isakson voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and has since voted over 60 times in favor of ending it.

Isakson favors tougher border security to address the immigration issue. **In 2019, he voted to support President Trump's national emergency declaration.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Trump's public views on Bitcoin are also commonly known from his [tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) ""I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity... **We have only one real currency** in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is **called the United States Dollar!** ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My key takeaways, thoughts, and questions are as follows:

1) Bakkt will introduce regulated retail payment solution for cryptocurrency. They will advertise that you can spend your cryptocurrency at Starbucks however they will conduct this to **collect Bitcoin on a large scale.** This will be facilitated by a closed system where you will not be able to use your cryptocurrency outside the Bakkt system.

2) The main driver behind The Lightning Network is an advocate for KYC. *If no KYC can you not participate in The LN?*

3) Why is there such a strong connection between Bitcoin, the Republican party, and the Trump administration?

4) Why is the largest investor in **WeChat** investing in Bakkt?

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know your thoughts below and whether you have more information you can add to this, especially Naspers' involvement.

e90a7k,Is it worth it to sacrifice my health for bitcoin?,"I've been holding bitcoin ever since before the pump to 14k (average is sitting around 8-9k), which has been over 6 months now.  Every week when I check the price and it keeps going down it affects my health negatively because I keep losing more money and I keep adding more funds into bitcoin, but it just goes down even more.  I thought by now it would at least be 20k.  Even when I don't check the price i'm constantly thinking or stressing about it.

Even if I can end up making 500 grand it will take until 2025 at this slow rate.  Will it be worth it to risk my health and be stressed out for 5 years and basically not experience my life to it's fullest for this period of time?

e93h8z,Bitcoin rulez and you can also keep your opinions on others choices with it to your self.,"I'm sure a lot of you are going to be pain-stricken to hear of such events, but yesterday I chose to use a dirty old bitcoin/fiat ATM. But hold the spears before you hear me out. The greatest thing about bitcoin is no one can challenge how you spend you're value when you see fit and never forget that. Also I understand if you're not a poor shmuck like I, then this post probably doesn't apply to you at all.  


I've been in a rut for a long time, bitcoin and crypto helped me get partially out of that rut by seeing the potential when I got in early 2017. But let's be honest, what fun is hodling? dreaming of things you could trade coin for in the future; always believing your sats will go further in the future. It is a very likely probability given the time btw, but life is actually precious. Pouring too much of your reward of working time of society into an asset hoping some day you'll get rich, again not saying that's not likely but I am saying what's more likely is you're becoming blind to the greater investments in life. the progressions in other technological fields that you may have been excited about but had your dreams fade over time, perhaps for the same reasons that brought you to the great orange currency.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get into a specific field of work over the summer, having 3/4 of the physical gear required but missing some critical pieces and not having the fiat as my credit is ruined, my bills keep me stretched, etc; I couldn't complete my work goal. Fast forward to the past weekend, thinking about cyber Monday and black Friday and knowing I had a chunk of coin and a bit of fiat to work with I decided to pull the f\*cking trigger, just like buying bitcoin I traveled to a bitcoin atm, fully prepared to pay the fee. I planned the entire expense out to the T, and I really asked myself ""is this what I want? do I see value in this?"" and I remembered the Rick and Morty meme with the bitcoins, where retard Rick is saying ""hey if you see value in this, and no one else does, who cares"". Even if 99% of you guys don't see value in what I've chosen to do, I don't care, because I do and even in time if the value of what I've traded my coin for falls. Perhaps I've used that equipment to make twice as much coin as most of you could hope to achieve threw simply hodling what you have. Perhaps I'll be wrong but also perhaps bitcoin will be in a quagmire for the next 2 years and I have lots of time to recoup any trade losses anyways while everyone greedily hodls and waits for something called a moon lambo---- IT'S CALLED THE TESLA CYBER TRUCK BY THE WAY. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I'm trying to get at is bitcoin is YOUR freedom for YOUR choices, no person or bank, relative or friend should discourage you from using it as you see fit, which is exactly what satoshi designed it for. If you want to spend your bitcoin, do it if you can justify the trade in value- it was a hard choice to part with coin for this hardware but I see the value it can bring me in the future and to me, that's all that counts because in the last 24 hours my attitude is up more then bitcoin has been in the last 2 years because of my choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to mention though, anything I've ever bought by trading coin for fiat or directly, I treasure and take great care of. The first thing I ever bought with bitcoin was an umbrella which I used tonight to keep me dry and not cranky, it's just next to me as I type. Do what you see fit with your sats, if it keeps your feet dry when you're between pay then it sounds worth it to me, because those sats can always be bought back if you keep working hard because you're still in good health.

The world's first Bitcoin fund is established in the United States,"During the fierce game of virtual digital currencies between governments and investors around the world, the financial regulatory authorities in the United States quietly opened up an opportunity to allow long-term institutional investors to enter the market.
 On December 10, the relevant blockchain reported from the media that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a new Bitcoin futures fund. The asset management company named Stone Ridge currently has a fund size of 15 billion  US dollars.  It is reported that as early as October of this year, the US asset management agency submitted the registration statement of the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategic Fund to the American Securities and Exchange Commission. After two detailed amendments, the registration took effect on December 8, US time.  It is also the first similar fund approved by the SEC.
 At present, it is not known whether the admission of such funds by the SEC can stabilize the price of Bitcoin.  However, it can be seen that the United States is trying to accept Bitcoin.

e97s6u,The two talking points for helping newbies understand the difference between Bitcoin and national currencies: Bitcoin is global/public and it uses a percentage-based unit.,"Bitcoin has two primary factors that make it different than national currencies.

1. Bitcoin is global and open/public. Anyone at all, who has the resources, can participate in it's governance, even at the developer level (making the rules). This is in contrast to governance of national currencies where making the rules usually involves being elected or appointed, and usually requires being a citizen of that nation in ""good standing"".

2. Bitcoin is percentage based, where 1 Bitcoin is regulated to be 1/21,000,000th of the total number of bitcoins. Always. (Unless the majority votes to change it.) This is in contrast to quantity-based currencies, where the total number of units can, and often does, change at any time.

That's it. Everything else about Bitcoin is seen in some national currencies, at least, if not most. I mean, other than Bitcoin being only digital.

e98dwn,German Solarisbank launches Bitcoin custody business The Berlin institute wants to be one of the first German banks to store crypto currencies.,"The new German Money Laundering Act, which regulates the safekeeping of crypto currencies in a legally secure manner, has barely come into force when interested banks venture out of cover. 

The Berlin Solarisbank is one of the first German banks to take the offensive and planning to build up a cryptocurrency custody solution, as the Handelsblatt has learned in advance. The plans are to be officially announced on Wednesday.

The new money laundering law allows banks to offer and keep crypto currencies. From 2020, financial institutions will be able to offer their customers crypto currencies as well as traditional securities such as shares and bonds in legally secure online banking at the touch of a button.

For this purpose, Solarisbank has founded the subsidiary Solaris Digital Assets. In 2020, it will apply to the financial supervisory authority Bafin for one of the newly introduced crypto custody licenses and will then store Bitcoin and other virtual currencies on behalf of customers.

e9any0,Video shows bitcoin vulnerable to double attack,"This video in Portuguese shows a double spent attack that can be performed by anyone!  Anyone at all!  With only one cryptocurrency wallet.  At the beginning of the video is a Brazilian Youtuber and bitcoiners, who claim to prove that transactions with BTC are instantaneous, as there would be no need to wait for a confirmation from the BTC network.  But the video proves the opposite, and shows that it is possible for anyone to double-spend bitcoins, and that bitcoins are bad for micropayments!  The same test was also done with BCH, but it didn't have the same result, so BCH is better for micropayments than BTC.

e9lx68,How I managed to get Bitcoin SV stolen,"Log of events leading to my stupid loss of Bitcoin SV coins.

1. I discovered the Bitcoin SV in my Coinbase account. The      only option they provided for this coin was to send it somewhere.
2. I wanted to convert the coins to BTC in my      blockchain.com account. But they don't support BSV.
3. I found a site, changenow, that would convert the      coins.
4. Foolishly, I did not test the site. When it asked for      the receiving address, I apparently entered blockchains address. The coins      were sent directly to blockchain.com without converting to BTC.
5. Since blockchain.com doesn't handle BSV, they never      received them. The coins were in limbo on the Blockchain SV transaction      chain.
6. I searched the internet trying to find a solution to      this problem. I could not find a simple solution.
7. I contacted blockchain.com, describing the problem. Their      customer support responded with a description of the situation and several      suggestions. Their response was excellent.
8. Based on one of their suggestions, I decided to use a      desktop wallet that supported Bitcoin SV. By creating the wallet with the      12 secret words from my blockchain.com wallet, I hoped the desktop wallet      would retrieve the coins.
9. Recognizing the risk, I basically emptied my      blockchain.com wallet.
10. Since I had used Electrum, I decided to use their SV      wallet.
11. I found it, downloaded Electrum-BSV-4.0.4.exe, installed      it. and elected to create the wallet by importing the Bitcoin SV secret      words.
12. After I entered the 12 words, the program failed to      connect to the internet, so I tried again, and it failed again.
13. I moved on to atomcwallet.exe. The wallet it created      had its own 12 words, so I restored a wallet with the 12 words. My coins      did not appear so once again I moved on.
14. My next choice was Exodus on my Windows 10 computer.
15. I created my wallets using the 12 words from my      blockchain.com account. Effectively I created a clone of that account. I      entered the words manually.
16. I did a refresh in Exodus and the BSV coins appeared. 
17. Exodus has an exchange feature where you can convert      one coin for another. There is a fee for this.
18. Since I had pretty much emptied my blockchain.com      before starting the process, I didn't have enough to cover the exchange      fee.
19. I transferred a small amount of BTC from Coinbase to      cover the fee.
20. I used the program to exchange the BSV for BTC. The      exchange was going to take a while, so I closed the program.
21. When I returned a few hours later I could see that the      exchange had occurred, but the BTC had been sent somewhere.
22. I was confused and ultimately contacted the Exodus      support team.
23. A few hours later the rest of my BTC disappeared.

I worked for a while with the Exodus support team. Despite their excellent support, ultimately the coins were stolen in step 12 and not recoverable.

I made two mistakes as indicated in steps 4 and 12. In step 4, I should have tested the conversion with a small amount so I would understand the process. Had I done so, none of the rest would have been necessary. In step 12, I did not find the real Electrum SV product, but one apparently designed to steal your coins.

Ultimately, I did find an excellent desktop wallet, Exodus, with a great support team. I'll be using them in the future. I also learned more about crypto currencies and blockchain during the process. It's too bad the tuition was so dammed high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9lx68/how_i_managed_to_get_bitcoin_sv_stolen/,ole44bill,1,2019-12-12 10:26:19,1,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9lx68/how_i_managed_to_get_bitcoin_sv_stolen/,NaN

Everyone says that 2 Ôºæ 256 is a very large number.  But I am more real, what is the concept of 2 Ôºæ 256?  How big is it?
 (2 Ôºæ 256) This number is much larger than our usual number, so it is difficult for people to have concepts, but we can try.
 2 Ôºæ 256 is 8 times 2 Ôºæ 32 multiplied.
 2 ^ 256 = 2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32‚úñÔ∏è2 ^ 32
 2 Ôºæ 32 is equal to about 4 billion-does this number have a concept?  It's the kind of numbers that appear in news headlines.

A fully indexed Bitcoin full node can take up to 300Gi disk space and non-trivial amount of CPU and memory, which is quite a bit for an everyday laptop which is also used for other purposes.

A cloud based Bitcoin full node can be accessed from anywhere through multiple devices, using standard tooling such as¬†gcloud¬†and¬†kubectl.

If you want to develop or test a Bitcoin application, it is easy to point local development environment to the Bitcoin full node through¬†port forwarding¬†and then smoothly deploy it to the cloud later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9mezl/setting_up_a_bitcoin_full_node_on_gcp_using/,hongchao,1,2019-12-12 11:31:27,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9mezl/setting_up_a_bitcoin_full_node_on_gcp_using/,NaN

e9v7ev,Can someone please explain to Mark Cuban that nobody is using Bitcoin as a currency because of legal tender laws and because it is classified as property by the IRS?,"The Bitcoin community consists of at least ten million members (probably more)... if overnight the IRS/government treated Bitcoin the same way they treat the US Dollar, then at least 5 million of us would convert some % of our paychecks to Bitcoin and use it for things like groceries, farmers markets, televisions, cars, monthly savings, rent, gym memberships, etc... 

Arguing that Bitcoin isn't a success because nobody uses it for payments is beyond absurd and is not a logical argument.  It simply rests on an appeal to authority (i.e. nobody uses Bitcoin for payments because the powers that be are literally putting up barriers for it to be used that way).

So, assuming we can change the laws then millions of people will start being more vocal about paying in Bitcoin, which will create another feedback loop, because it will create ""Conspicuous Bitcoin Consumption"", more people will see us do it, and will see that merchants like it.... and then it will spread like wildfire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9v7ev/can_someone_please_explain_to_mark_cuban_that/,the420chronicler,1,2019-12-12 23:02:56,37,/r/Bitcoin/comments/e9v7ev/can_someone_please_explain_to_mark_cuban_that/,NaN

ea1kou,"New bitcoin conviniance unit; Fiatbit (like, mbtc, bits, sats)","Fiatbit is either one tenth, or hundredth, ... or hundred millionth of BTC, what you can buy for within your fiat 0.1 - 1.0.

In other words, you can always buy 1 - 10 fiatbits, for your 1 unit fiat.

Fiatbit isn't a fixed unit like mbtc, bits or satoshi. It changes with the fiat you use, and exchange rate in the fiat you use.

Example, for USD, dolorbit stays always between $0.1 - $1.0. 

Now 1 BTC is $7200, so dolorbit is 0.0001 btc, or $0.72.. can be written as $‚Çø4.72. Here 4 is kind of ""checksum"" (4 represents one ten-thousandth of BTC, and 0.72 represents 0.72 USD).

Once price goes up $10k or more, your dolorbit becomes 0.00001 btc (say, $‚Çø5.12345). When price goes below $1k, dolorbit becomes 0.001 btc (say, $‚Çø3.123).

Similarly, we can get other units ‚Ç¨‚Çø (eurobit), ¬£‚Çø (poundbit), ‚Çπ‚Çø (rupeebit), ¬•‚Çø (yuanbit / yenbit) etc.

Current fiatbit for,
$ is 0.001 btc ($‚Çø4.7200)
¬• (CNY) is 0.00001 btc (¬•‚Çø5.5xxx) 
¬£ is 0.0001 btc (¬£‚Çø4.54xx)
‚Çπ is 0.000001 btc (‚Çπ‚Çø6.51xx)
¬• (JPY) is 0.000001 btc (¬•‚Çø6.79xx)
Gold is 0.1 btc (XAU‚Çø1.4925)
Gold gm is 0.001 btc (gold gm ‚Çø 3.1528)

Not a rocket science.. say in your country you can buy 1 btc for 12345678 bucks.. then your bucks-bit is 0.00000001 btc, with price 8.12345678 bucks.

8 represents one hundred millionth of BTC, and 0.12345678 represents the price of that (one hundred millionth of BTC).

Is there a way how I can make paying by bitcoin less tedious? The process for buying bitcoins seems really long for most as they need to sign up, verify, wait etc which is quite long. I offer a discount on my website if paid through bitcoin but im struggling to think of anything else. 

I was currently making a tutorial on how one can pay on the site and was thinking of using exchanges such as [switchere.com](https://switchere.com)  or [moon.io](https://moon.io) where customers can buy bitcoins without verification.

I have released the new parser blk file for Bitcoin; it is my first work on Bitcoin and one of the two big projects for my programmer live.

&amp;#x200B;

SpyCBlock is my thesis project ""Extraction data to Bitcoin Blockchain"" with it you can build the 2 complete serializations:

* Transaction graph Serialization
* Complete blk serialization to JSON with the additional information, how the hash of the block and the hash of the transaction.

SpyCBlock implemented the partial serialization address graph  (This uses the Bitcoin-core with version &lt;= 18.0.1).

&amp;#x200B;

With the JSON format is possible to run more analisis on the network, for example, [my analisis](https://vincenzopalazzo.github.io/AnalyticsPyBlock/) on the type of script run with the [AnalyticsPyBlock](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/AnalyticsPyBlock).

&amp;#x200B;

eai48o,Don't use Bitcoin Blender. They just scammed me.,"Hi guys,

TL;DR: Couldn't get my 0.016xx BTC from Bitcoin Blender cause of ""withdraw limitations"". Sent more BTC to get over the limit and sent them to my electrum wallet. Now they are just gone. Don't use this service!

So to make some transaction I wanted to mix my BTC. Just a small amount 0.016xx BTC. I transferred it to Bitcoin Blender which I before this date never used but heard it's a good mixing service.

The BTC arrived and I wanted to sent them to the destination. Besides it's clearly stating ""Amount of bitcoins to send (minimum 0.001 BTC)"" there was an error message with something like ""Due to high server load minimum withdraw amount is 0.05 BTC"". I was like ""Okay ..."". Then I slept and tried it again on the morning. Same message. Now I was already a little bit suspicious. Of course there is ALWAYS high server load, right. Then I wrote a support ticket and over the whole day tried again and again to transfer the BTC with the same result ... not possible.

Here I made the mistake: Instead of just waiting or writing the BTC off I thought I could transfer BTC up to the needed minimum amount, transfer it to my electrum and then never visit the site again and find another reliable mixing service. You know how it went:

Transferred the missing amount, sent it off to my electrum with a 1-2h delay. The website told something like ""Bitcoins sent"" or something like that which suggests the BTC are on there way. I was happy. After maybe 20 minutes I refreshed the page. The BTC amount of my account was now zero. I looked under Withdraw but there was no notification of any transaction. I opened my electrum wallet and there was nothing to see of an incoming transaction. Then I checked blockchain.info for my wallets address. Also nothing. After the first shock I thought: ""Oh wait you made a delay, maybe therefore it's not showing anything"". Since it was already late I went to bed.

Now today I check my electrum and nothing is there. It's like nothing ever happened. Wrote another support ticket but yeah ... as if I will ever receive any answer on them.

So the amount of BTC is nothing that ruins me or stuff and I can write this off under ""lessons learned"" but I still wanted to tell this maybe somebody will read it and don't use this scammer service.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eai48o/dont_use_bitcoin_blender_they_just_scammed_me/,ShitIGotScammed,1,2019-12-14 10:16:54,42,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eai48o/dont_use_bitcoin_blender_they_just_scammed_me/,NaN

eaj8lk,Improving Bitcoin Privacy and Self Sovereignty - Questions from a KYC Exchange User,"INTRO:
Bitcoin privacy and best practice advice is often spoken about as if you were just entering the bitcoin space (with disregard to previous bad habbits). However I'm curious what steps can taken, and what advice there is for someone that is hodling bitcoin purchased through a KYC exchange, and who is not (yet) fully sovereign.

BACKGROUND:
The advice I was given for buying my fist satoshis was to use a KYC exchange such as coinbase. I was also told about the importance of holding my own keys, so was told to get a Ledger Nano S, connect it to a Ledger Live wallet, and to always transfer my BTC out of the exchange.

For someone who was new to bitcoin at the time, I don't believe anyone can dispute this advice given to me, as the on-boaring experience was very good and not at all daunting, nor overwhelmingly technical. Seeing the satoshis arrive in my Ledger Live wallet was the first step to changing my media skewed perception of bitcoin, and only made me more curious as to what the big deal was all about.

My questions below though personal to my own situation, are likely applicable to many others.

QUESTIONS:
1.) What can I do with my existing bitcoins purchased through a KYC exchange where my identity has already been linked to my transactions/bitcoins/UTXOs?

2.) Should I sell all my existing bitcoins, and re-purchase using a method where privacy is better protected (i.e through a P2P exchange)?

3.) What is the easiest on-boarding approach to running a full node with a hardware wallet such as Ledger?

4.) Is there an application for running a full node where I can remotely connect to it from my mobile phone while I'm away? Some what mimicking being able to run Ledger Live on my mobile and on my desktop computer. Or is the alternative/best practice to run a full node at home connected to a wallet (like a savings account), and have a separate wallet app (with a different private key) on my phone for everyday transactions (only for holding small amounts of satoshis)? And what would be the best practices of coin management when transfering between each wallet?

5.) What is the best practice for privacy if you want to send bitcoin to a friend (or vice versa), where you dont know what privacy steps they have taken with their bitcoin?

6.) What is the best practice for privacy to make a bitcoin payment for a product or service (like buying a cup of coffee)?

7.) Anything else you feel is important to mention? Should I really be concerned, or just continue to stack sats the way I am currently doing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eaj8lk/improving_bitcoin_privacy_and_self_sovereignty/,FracturedKnees,1,2019-12-14 12:36:21,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eaj8lk/improving_bitcoin_privacy_and_self_sovereignty/,NaN

easw5g,Max Keizer: Bitcoin comes to promote peace," He states that with the appearance of Bitcoin, the first real opponent against Fiat money was born. Keiser argues that the digital currency is the peaceful replacement in the face of the inherent violence of the Fiat. For this reason, as the title indicates, Bitcoin brings peace to the world, being its labor field the financial one. In addition, it states that Bitcoin is the reincarnation of gold, making reference that it is closest to when gold began to be used as money. 

[Brave Browser Download Free Now Adblock](https://brave.com/cri518)

 Keizer claims that Bitcoin has its strength because people want it that way, as was the case with precious metals. Therefore, Keizer explains and highlights the real end of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, taking power away from politicians and Central Banks. Use the phrase ""it's not about money, it's about sending a message"", referring to the fact that the use of Bitcoin by people is a reflection that people want change.

How to mine, What to mine, ETC.

Things that could help you hlep me if you so kindly would be willing to is:

\*My electricity is free.

\*i have little to no money.

\*i have no experience in this mining e-currency field.

I just want to know where to get started by someone pointing me in the right direction.

I primarily want to mine bitcoin as it seems popular however people are saying its not profitable at the moment (probably due to average electricity costs, repairs to miners, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

but like i said none of that matters to me as my electrcity is free.

&amp;#x200B;

eb3i0j,Some very important points that most people do not understand about Bitcoin,"**Point 1)**

Most people do not understand that you can't send money over internet, but only information. **Bitcoin is the first digital settlement layer.**

When I send a picture to someone on Facebook messenger, I don't actually send a picture. I send information about the pictures structure, and the picture gets restructured on the client side (the cellphone) of the user I send it to. Copy of the information is being sent, not the picture itself. So you can't send money over internet, it is not possible, only information.

If I have a bank account at some bank, and I send $50 dollars to another person in the same bank by using the banks website, then a transaction happens between two people within the same infrastructure, which is the banks back-end system and database. So the banks system just subtracts $50 dollars from one person and adds $50 dollars to another person. But no money has moved, only information has been edited. But if I send money to someone that uses another Bank, then this bank has its own infrastructure which is independent of the first. So Bank1 tells Bank2 that they have a user that wants to send money to a user of the other bank. So Bank1 subtracts $50 from User1, and Bank2 adds $50 to User2, but now Bank1 owes Bank2 $50, why? Because you can't send money over internet. So they have to settle the difference between them with some kinds of a settlement system, (cash, gold or a third party like a central bank).

With Bitcoin, because of how the system works, it is almost as if you can send value over internet for the first time, even though you don't really send value, you still send information, but since the infrastructure is global, it is like the first example, it is as if the world has (one large bank infrastructure), that is fully automated and which no one controls.

This alone makes Bitcoin extremely valuable, because it is a trust less digital settlement layer which is extremely secure and not dependent on one particular nation or organisation.

**Point 2)**

There can never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. This is very hard for people to grasp. Because what do you mean there can never be more than 21 million bitcoin? It sounds like a game, such a scam... People do not understand that Bitcoin is not normal software. In normal software the developers can change the code as they want and publish the code when they want. They do not understand that Bitcoin is a software that is not like a normal software. You can't actually change the number even if the number is programmed in. Which of-course most people will deny, because it makes no sense for most people. They do not understand that even though it is theoretically possible to change it, it is practically almost impossible. It is theoretically possible for me to convince half of Sweden to burn half of their money, but practically impossible. Just because something is theoretically possible, doesn't mean that it will happen within a time frame, or even in your lifetime. In order for the 21 million supply to change, most people in the Bitcoin community needs to agree on it, which is practically impossible. Miners have to change to the new protocol and so on. Not going to happen.

**Point 3)**

People think that $100,000 bitcoin is wishful thinking and that there is not enough money in the world for Bitcoin to be worth millions of dollars. Which I can assure you is false. Bitcoin can even be worth $50 million dollars per coin, which would make 2 satoshi 1 dollar. Even if one Bitcoin transaction would cost 10 000 Satoshi. You might say, that's not possible, whats the point if one transaction is so expensive. Again, you don't need to actually do a transfer of money, as in the first example of point 1, virtual transactions on bank level can happen, or on Coinbase. You can send 100 satoshi to someone and pay 1 satoshi in fee ""on the bank level"", not on chain, banks or exchanges then will settle the difference as they want. At least with Bitcoin you have the option to be you own bank, even if that will cost you more, you still have the option. This is already happening in front of your eyes. Banks like Dutch ING, Deutsche bank, even exchanges want to operate as banks. This is already happening and it is the correct move forwards, a mix between the legacy banking system and cryptocurrencies. Most people are too lazy and stupid to operate like us, it is a fact well known.

In terms of the price, money inflow is not the same as market cap. For Bitcoin to have 21 trillion market cap, Bitcoin does not need 21 trillion of money inflow. Bitcoin price is dependent on market sentiment, if the market sentiment is such that very few people want to sell their coins because the price keeps going up then you might have 100x market cap of the money inflow. So 1 billion USD in money inflow translates to 100 billion USD in market cap. The multiplier can be 10x, 2x or 50x, all depends on market sentiment and time period. So an inflow of 10 trillion USD in 10 years might lead to 100 trillion USD market cap of BTC and 5 million USD per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin value have no roof, the price might actually just keep going up and up and up and up and up. We have never had something that is absolutely scarce, and global, and seen as an alternative form of money, when the rest of the world keeps bubbling up. There is no limit on the BTC price because the whole world works with a bubbly system, and the way Bitcoin is price discovered, is a guaranteed insane BTC price in the future. Even $100 million USD per Bitcoin in 50 years before I am dead is possible.

**Point 4)**

Fiat does not need to die, and Bitcoin does not need to take over in order for Bitcoin to have ""ridiculous price"". No financial crisis is needed. Actually what you want is things to just continue as they have done in the last 10 years. No too extreme events. Just ""small events"" here and there. You can't change human nature, it is inevitable. Bitcoin is so ingrained into our world that there is no way back. There will be people with whole Bitcoin, and people without. Just like people with gold and stock investments and real estate, and people without those things. No insane events, this is all normal.

**Point 5)**

Bitcoin has won as the financial cryptocurrency. No flippening will happen. The only flippening will be with gold and fiat currencies. If I wanted to, I could have developed a system like PayPal in 1 month time, and it would be able to do 5000 transactions per second because I would use MySQL and SSD, but no one would use my service because they would not trust me because they have no idea who I am and what my service is, and there is no one to send money too, so the network is not there. Bitcoin has won because security and network effect is way more important than transactions per second. Transactions per second will be dealt with on bank level, exchange level, or layer 2 solutions. This is already clear to me. Bitcoin has won.

**Point 6)**

In order to understand Bitcoin and what will happen in the future, you have to be able to see things that are not in front of you. You can't compare Bitcoin to Tulip mania, or even Gold. Because something like Bitcoin has never existed before and you have to think about it's properties and try to understand it with human nature and with how the world works and how everything keeps increasing, and Bitcoin is the thing that does not increase in supply. You will eventually accept the unnatural thought of Bitcoin never stopping going up in value, which is something that is hard to come to terms with, because it feels unnatural, ""and it could not possibly be so"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eb3i0j/some_very_important_points_that_most_people_do/,21btc,1,2019-12-15 19:40:06,108,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eb3i0j/some_very_important_points_that_most_people_do/,NaN

I wanted to do my own research on this and asked if I could do it on my own, but he said he would give me the company address and that I cannot find it anywhere online because only workers can use it or something like that.

Because so far it looks so damn complicated. Only people in IT and people who know something about security, privacy, anonymity etc. Know what is up. 
If you own any bitcoins, you constantly worry about hackers if you do not have a good wallet and so on. 

Is anyone actually working on something to make bitcoin a classic currency that kids can use to buy candy or something? 

So far, for me ,this is just a big mess and people use bitcoin just for market trading, holding (as gold) or buying illegal stuff because of anonymity.

ebhp7x,"Over the past year my team and I have been tirelessly working to build a Bitcoin onramp built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners. Today, I'm excited to introduce River Financial: the best place to buy, sell, and use Bitcoin for the long term investor.","Hey /r/bitcoin! I'm Alex Leishman, a longtime Bitcoiner and member of this sub. 

Today I'm very proud to announce the launch of River Financial ([river.com](https://river.com)), a financial institution built specifically for long-term Bitcoin investors.

TL;DR At River.com you can:

* Connect your U.S. bank account and buy Bitcoin at a competitive price with USD
* Setup recurring Bitcoin purchases with discounted fees 
* Send and receive Bitcoin onchain or via the Lightning Network
* See detailed investment performance metrics and select specific tax lots when selling (coming soon)
* Easily access human support (phone, chat, email)

**Background**

Like many of you, I became quite frustrated over the last few years as I watched many once-respected companies in the space (e.g. Coinbase) turn their backs on Bitcoin and become casinos for altcoin trading. So, I decided to compete with them and build the company that Bitcoin deserves. 


At River.com we deeply believe that Bitcoin (and Bitcoin alone) will continue to grow in its role as a globally recognized currency and store of value, and will eventually sit alongside or challenge today‚Äôs government-backed fiat currencies. We're building a financial institution around this hypothesis.


We have built our technical infrastructure from the ground up. All core applications run on our own servers sitting in a 2,000lb vault only we have access to (not your servers, not your company). And, of course, the vast majority of funds are held in a multisig PSBT-based cold storage system. By focusing exclusively on Bitcoin, we can provide access to the latest features Bitcoin has to offer. We already support the Lightning Network and will be ready to go with Schnorr support if/when the taproot soft fork is accepted by the network!

 
If you'd like to read more about River Financial and who we are, check out our blog post [here](https://river.com/blog/posts/introducing-river-financial).


We are based in San Francisco, and growing quickly. We are currently still in invite-only mode as we scale up. If you are eager to get access, sign up here river.com/request and DM me. I'll see what I can ;)


Feel free to ask any questions below!

 
**FAQ**

*How are you better than Coinbase?*

* Discounted recurring purchases
* Lightning Network Support
* Proper accounting and financial reporting tools (easily see your unrealized gains and losses)
* Human support
* And lots more to come
 
*What states do you currently support?*

* California
* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* Montana
* Pennsylvania
* Texas
* Wisconsin
* Wyoming

With many more coming early next year.
 
*Will you support other cryptocurrencies?*

No.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebhp7x/over_the_past_year_my_team_and_i_have_been/,alex_leishman,1,2019-12-16 16:55:38,155,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebhp7x/over_the_past_year_my_team_and_i_have_been/,NaN

eblaqp,HELP PROMOTE BITCOIN,"Dont throw the prices and yields or personal gains on Bitcoin in your friends or familys face this holiday time..  maybe instead, bring up the core values of decentralization payments, peer to peer transactions ox all kinds of data.. and of course the fact that BTC goes from strength to strength. This time last year or something like that, 2010 maybe, BTC was at it's all time low.. maybe it was just for that year  exactly 1 year later it's still dumping massively but STILL over 103% increase in value.
If they dont want to look at it as a payme t system ...(yet), then use it as a money box. Explain how fiat will always make people poorer than before without realizing but BTC wont. Only market volatility is what we watch for HODLers. Explain a little, even open them a wallet and use your referral for Coinbase or some other wallet and get money yourself. Get them to link their bank, just as PayPal would, and if needed, send them some crypto... $10 worth of BTC. If they add to it then great, if they dont, keep checking the balance for them when your together and they will see it riskng and falling..  and that in itself will induce interest.
The problem right now is the BTC dumps. To counter this, we need the order books filled with orders (longs) for below market price expecting a pump. A $10 stake will help, but we need to rally for bitcoin as this is at a critical level for the long od crypto, the first and most valuable and possibly the best find of the 21st century.

Help get the tag on a trend... it's been seen worldwide. If interested, I have a oink to register to Coinbase and will send you it if you dknt have an account.

Also have a trading course, just a one off fee for charts and what they mean  a basic profit method and alot more. Subscription trade calls and setups. NOT MANDATORY.... but please do get the coinbase thing going and in support  we are all changing our social media profile AVATARS to Bitcoin logos so if you would do that, it shows you support the safe, decentralized, minimal fee payme t system, run on a blockchain which is the future.

ebmbso,Finally bought my first order of Bitcoin to HODL! Some advice on storage needed!,"Hey Reddit /rBitcoin,

&amp;#x200B;

As said in the title, finally got my head around buying Bitcoin for holding terms only. I've already had an experience with the more gambling side (day trading), yup I'm a noob. But lesson learned, so I decided to buy Bitcoin by small increments over my next salaries (instead of wasting it on partying).

As stated previously, even though I've been informing myself about the sphere over the past couple of years, I just got my first 'real' order, which is here to stay (to the moon!). Hence, I am looking for some advice regarding storage of the currency. 

I was thinking initially to keep it on an app on my phone, but even I am afraid that I might loose it or get it stolen. 

The second option is a cold storage (which cost another amount), but to which I will probably swap when I get additional   
and higher amount of funds.

If anyone would care to give me advice on which course of action to take. Also, I wouldn't mind any additional information to learn about Bitcoin storage and transactions which I still have a bit of a hard time getting my head around.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers!

ebpe89,"Buying Bitcoin, Virtual Game Currencies, and Taxes","HI Reddit,

I have a question regarding buying bitcoins, in game currency (specifically OSRS), and Taxes.

Starting around 2016, I began buying bitcoin through LocalBC, to use with OSRS, and just other general video game type things (buying/trading accounts, buying servers/proxies, buying game cards/gift cards, even trading for consoles/pcparts ,and some other video game currency based transactions like on GTA .) I only ever BOUGHT bitcoin through LBC, I have never sold BTC for real life money. I have however, traded bitcoin for OSRS, and traded OSRS gold for bitcoin, using multiple OSRS accounts. I did sell some OSRS for IRL $ through PP over the years, probably around $1500-2500 and bought random stuff with that money, I would also use the OSRS gold almost just like BTC, to buy accounts on other games or gift cards or whatever virutal thing I needed or wanted at the moment. I used the OSRS gold also in game (yes I actually play), gambling at the sand casino and high risk PKing. So basically over the years, I've used to same LBC account, and it says it has 10-20 btc ONLY BOUGHT over the years. The thing is, for awhile I was trading alot when BTC was worth like 2-4k, then sometimes I was trading with it at 10k-15k, so this 10-20 BTC trade amount is pretty deceptive. My main concern is my LBC account is verified with my ID ( yes call you stupid if you must), and I'm sort of afraid of this amount of BTC transactions getting picked up by the IRS, and me somehow having to pay taxes on 10-20 BTC which is alot now. As I said, the account ONLY has BUYING transactions, no sales, so that probably makes a difference. I've even been thinking of closing my longtime account on LBC due to these concerns. I had never even thought about taxes on what I was doing over the years because I wasn't really making that much money (off the OSRS gold)  if I even was making any at the time, or at least I wasn't trying to or making a business out of it.        So my question is, do I have to worry? Does the IRS care about people BUYING BTC? If so, what will happen? Will my account maybe get flagged by them, (if 10-20BTC over 4-5 years is enough) ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebpe89/buying_bitcoin_virtual_game_currencies_and_taxes/,zepl0n,1,2019-12-17 02:27:02,3,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebpe89/buying_bitcoin_virtual_game_currencies_and_taxes/,NaN

ebqd6k,"Reasons for Bitcoin falling below $ 7,000","Bitcoin plummeted, falling nearly 3.5% in less than 10 minutes, and once approached $ 6,800, a new low on November 28.
 It is worth noting that during the same time period, the decline of Ethereum was even worse, from $ 141 to below $ 130, a drop of nearly 8%, a new low since mid-March.
 At the same time, the declines of LTC, EOS, and XLM are also more prominent, all falling more than 7% in 24 hours.
 About four hours before the major currency plummeted, data analysis company Chainalysis released a report on the crypto scam Plustoken.
 With almost no bad news, the market seems to have found a culprit for the plunge.  Some traders believe that the report's conclusions triggered panic in the market, which led to the plunge.
 The report states that 20,000 BTC (valued at $ 137 million) and 790,000 ETH (valued at $ 102 million) may still be controlled by PlusToken scammers.
 In addition, the company states that individuals associated with Plustoken have liquidated $ 185 million worth of stolen Bitcoins.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebqd6k/reasons_for_bitcoin_falling_below_7000/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-17 03:45:31,16,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebqd6k/reasons_for_bitcoin_falling_below_7000/,NaN

Until those fundamentals change in a material way, then I'm bullish on the price long-term.  It's important to focus on less volatile metrics that are more fundamental to Bitcoin's investment thesis.  Here is a quick list of fundamental reasons for Bitcoin's existence: 

1) The Fed continues to monetize government debt and bailout banks.  

2) Bitcoin continues to add blocks roughly every ten minutes with every satoshi 100% completely and accurately accounted for.  

3) Miners continue to push hash rate higher.  Although you'll notice that difficulty and hash rate are currently stagnating, which we have seen happen repeatedly throughout Bitcoin's history.  

4) Developers are building out more infrastructure.  

5) The US govt will continue to run budget deficits and increase the debt through excessive spending on military, welfare, and govt pet projects.  

6) Financial surveillance continues to increase as governments encroach on human liberty around the world.  

7) American consumerism continues to change and shape our environment in ways that we may not understand until it is too late.  Bitcoin is a check on consumer culture.  

8) 6 billion people around the world exist outside the US-centric banking system.  Bitcoin will accept them onto its financial network no questions asked...

watch: [https://youtu.be/B3SQtJ1hSl4](https://youtu.be/B3SQtJ1hSl4)  


In the past, people used commodities such as shells and jewellery as currency. Due to their rarity, they were used as a store of value.  


We then moved on to using banknotes. Banknotes are cheap to produce, yet can be traded for high valued goods. This is because they are backed by the government. With the rise of the internet, we went from banknotes to money of account. In our bank account, figures are added or subtracted when we receive salary or make purchases. Only banks have the right to alter our bank accounts.  


During the 2008 global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve used its power to increase the supply and circulation of money.  


Satoshi Nakamoto found this unreliable and worked on the creation of a new payment system where everyone has bookkeeping rights, controlled currency supply and a completely fair and transparent ledger system.  


That is the driving force behind the birth of Bitcoin.

ebz2sj,The Political State and Future of Bitcoin,"This post may not be so popular lol. But I'll tell you what you should hear. 

One of the big pushbacks I have gotten on reddit is over the banking secrecy act. I have been repeatedly told that I am making shit up or being conspiratorial. This is very very foolish of this community. The statements and releases were in a document released by the FATF. I read it. It's right there. It's in the document. They've come right out and said exactly what they intend to do, and have told exchange CEO' ""that's not our problem you WILL find a way to implement this"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I also follow the SEC and CFTC policy and press release strongly, and it is equally hostile and captured. It doesn't matter if a few people in the agencies are well intended. They don't call the shots. They are shadow regulatory industries controlled by people we will never see. The rich obviously. Dupont, Cargill, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bitcoin community has been deeply in denial about numerous issues pointed out. It has become a religion, incapable of receiving critique. 

\-Blind trust in Block stream

\-Blind trust in Chinese miners and wallstreet institutional mining

\-Blind trust in centralized exchanges

\-Blind trust in the venture capital token M.O

\-Blind trust in the idea of 'STO"" security tokens sanctioned and graced by banks/regulators

\-Blind trust in derivatives controlled by regulated bodies that can impose fractional reserve

\-Blind trust in the meme of an ETF

&amp;#x200B;

If this community was far more educated in history and political economy and the US foreign policy, you would never trust these regulated wallstreet instruments, you would never trust a rubber stamp. I mean think about it, how many people in this community are hoping for Wallstreet and regulators to pump their bags. Because that has become the meme. They believe that the government approval and integration into the financial economy is going to pump their bags. How's that working out?

We have less commerce acceptance, less adoption, less users with a thousand dollars in their wallet, than a year ago.

The belief that bitcoin can exist in a vaacuum and bubble, that it can exist without decentralized infrastructure at the mercy of centralized infrastructure in a hostile environment and become mass adopted by nations of people is delusional. It hasn't worked in a decade. Bitcoin is a hobby horse for geeks, speculators, and a revenue stream for centralized wallstreet and financial institutions globally. It is a proxy of bitmain, of these other institutions, and is becoming more and more centralized. The gini coeeficient of bitcoin dwarfs fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

And the problem \*is not bitcoin\* the problem is the community believing in these memes and not learning from economic history in antiquity and not building the infrastructure outside the states control and forcing the state into diplomacy. Bitcoiners are failed anarchist, they don't know how to politically represent themselves, they aren't wobblies, they aren't like classic leftist who forced these concepts onto the gilded aged imperialist western republics, that forced them to not send kids to work in coalmines for 12 hours a day. We aren't politically commanding.

&amp;#x200B;

The banking secrecy act is a extinction level event for crypto. Will bitcoin survive? Of course? But it's going to set us back a decade. It's going to send us back to the stone age. And we are at a \*profound\* risk of the main chain breaking off and becoming the pseudo banking state corporate nexus geofenced kyced bitcoin with backdoored nodes and backdoored hardware wallets. The statist wont break bitcoin in half, we will. We will out of desperation after they sully it so severely that we have no choice but to hard fork it into a original version that can protect itself against the BSA. You say we won't but we will, when they cripple the global south's access to it, and they cripple the price, you will have your braveheart mercy moment, and the og cypherpunk will kick the bucket and pull the trigger. What has to be done will be done.

&amp;#x200B;

Centralized exchanges are completely incompatible with cypherpunk and anarchism and the white paper. We've tolerated CEX for a decade. Not only are governments a threat, but we will be continually crippled by Quadriga CX failures, Cryptopia, and Mount Gox failures. Because of toxic maximalism and toxic attitude towards building the fucking infrastructure to avoid this. The mainstream developers won't do it because they can't make any money. This will be a sacrificial act to build this system, just like Satoshi.

&amp;#x200B;

The current DEX system is like the 1960's darpa intranet. That is it. That's why it sucks. It's not the internet of DEX, it's not. And making the internet of DEX is really, really, really fucking hard bleeding edge computer science. If we want global adoption we need an internet, not an intranet. Having the liquidity of DEX divided into intranet is why we continue to rel on CEX. You want to get rid of the CEX, turn the fucking intranet into an internet, into an interchain. Stop relying on companies and ICO's and 1000 tokens for 1000 things, build the actual backbone. Support the developers. Pay your fucking developers. Stop calling everything a scam and everything vaporware. The internet isn't a fucking vaporware scam, so neither is the interchain. Maximalism is ludditism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto is for the global south, it's for emancipatory politics and independence, for the 99.99%, not the .01%. If you believe otherwise, and want you're ""Citadel"", Fuck You. Seriously. Read some political economy. Read Ellinor Ostrom, Bestiat, Spooner, Proudhon, etc. Crypto is suppoose to be a public good and a form of open source economy, not a recreation of tyranny, hierarchy, economic centralization, and worse yet just another banker shitcoin debt scam interest rate scam, which is what they are treating it and regulating and profiting off of it as.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebz2sj/the_political_state_and_future_of_bitcoin/,samdane7777,1,2019-12-17 17:46:14,6,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ebz2sj/the_political_state_and_future_of_bitcoin/,NaN

\- I will probably invest in other currencies later and want to use the **same wallet for buying different currencies**

\- I want to be **able to transfer my funds into a different wallet** if need be (I read somewhere that someone lost their investments when switching phones?) or be able to keep my funds when moving from an old phone to a new phone, phone to computer, etc.

\- I want to have the **least risk possible if the place holding my money gets hacked** / I want to have my own control over my keys? don't know too much about this.

\- **Easy to use**. Pretty much just using to hold for long-term investments until I am a lot more familiar with things. I am not a very techy person.

ecg6aj,Why does bitcoin keep dropping when all predictions I find keeps giving drastic forecasts for it,"I'm making this post to gain some insight and understanding, so I'd really appreciate any constructive information you have for me.  

I have been researching everything I can on the trends of bitcoin over the past few years, forecasts and price predictions and major events that has affected the trends.  I find posts that are complete opposites, some downright discrediting bitcoin, other's speaking of cryptocurrencies like it's the alpha and omega, overall there is so much fake information out there that I don't know what to believe.  Almost every article I find for bitcoin is written by some crypto magazine or investor (who would of course be for it, all their money is into it), other times I find data that seem just downright made up because it isn't similar to anything anywhere else.  At this point I don't know what to believe any more.  

I understand the concept behind bitcoin, I intuitively understand the need for it, the use for it, I understand the perception of money and the value gained because of it.  I intuitively understand that with the scarcity increasing in 2020 the value ""should"" go up.  I understand the hows and whys of bitcoin, what I don't understand is I have found post after post of people making drastic predictions about bitcoin prices in the next few years, some even in 2020, for bitcoin anywhere between $14000 to $200000 and even higher.  But at the same time bitcoin has just been decreasing for almost 3 years, currently now sitting at \~$7000.  I simply don't understand how people are predicting such absurdly high amounts, when all trends and graphs show nothing but a steady convergence towards where it is going now.  

Perhaps those people are merely stating such absurd amounts to instigate adoption out of psychological manipulation, creating the perception that it'll be higher, therefore getting people to adopt, therefore actually making it higher.  Perhaps the downward decline now is only part of a much bigger curve.  But at this point I'm really tired of all the speculation and fake information out there and wasting my time on people's delusional data.  

What I'd appreciate is anyone out there, who can give me quality information about why bitcoin is going down and is so low right now, while everyone is saying it'll be so high in 2020-2023.  I'm not interested in some sales pitch or more fake information being parroted and gargled mindlessly to me, I just want the cold brutal facts so I can actually get some insight and think for myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecg6aj/why_does_bitcoin_keep_dropping_when_all/,Matriarx,1,2019-12-18 18:07:20,17,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecg6aj/why_does_bitcoin_keep_dropping_when_all/,NaN

ecj4al,Bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption.,"Bitcoin isn't quite ready for mass adoption.  Not yet.  

Here's why: *7 transactions per second.*  

That's 420 transactions per minute.  25,200 transactions per hour.  604,800 transactions per day.  

About **18 million transactions per month**.  

That's not enough for one-third of the households in Brazil (for example) to pay their rent/mortgage each month.  

There are about eight billion people on the planet, but we can only do 18 million transactions in 30 days.  It would take 36 years to do 8 billion transactions.  So, Bitcoin isn't ready, yet.  

We need to be patient, and encouraging, and supportive while really smart and motivated people work their tails off to get the 2nd layer ready for ""prime time"".  

. . .  

While we wait, the wallets get better and better... easier to use... safer to use...  

...others work on allowing us to use Bitcoin with even better privacy.  

Each day, more and more people see through the FUD and bullshit... more people start to understand what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works... more people start to see fiat money and central banking for what it really is.  

**This is a long term thing.  Not some, ""OMG!  The price went up/down from five minutes ago!!  Panic!!  Panic!!""**  

People still have a chance to get in at ""beginning"" of something good and honest that will eventually be totally fucking huge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecj4al/bitcoin_isnt_ready_for_mass_adoption/,Mark_Bear,1,2019-12-18 21:41:59,23,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecj4al/bitcoin_isnt_ready_for_mass_adoption/,NaN

ecs2wx,"Political blue-screen of death, Cybertruck and Bitcoin","1) Democrats just voted to Impeach with a straw house of fabricated half-accusations and not legitimate things. Note: Not liking the guy doesn't count. 

2) With Republicans holding 53/100 Jury seats a 67% Impeachment Vote with Jury is impossible. Largely due to legitimate claims not being present, and not because of a 3 jury majority advantage.

3) The attempt alone will make the Democrats appear as traders and Trump wins 2020 election. Democrats can't play chess, they just want to tip over the board and throw a tantrum. If only Democrats would stop trying to hack the system and instead adopted favourable policy. [Hillary Clinton - ""If I win the election I guarantee we go to war with Iran"" *cough* To back our Petro Dollar with more oil. Sorry - Evil Muppets don't win elections. War mongers don't either. 

4) In 2020 FED needs to find an opportunity to allow market to rebalance given they are running out of monetary tools to do so - therefore, great opportunity to let economy crash to offload blame of what is actually poorly managed fiscal policy - $22 TRN in debt.

5) Dollar will stumble Bitcoin will rise. China will launch gold backed Yuan and challenge the ""bankrupt"" Dollars reserve currency status. Therefore, do yourself a favour, buy $1000 in Bitcoin and $1000 in silver - both are money trees. 

Cybertruck is the only thing we have to look forward to in the near future. Elon had the foresight and vision to know we were going to need it; with where things are headed were going to need an exoskeleton of hardened steel. Elon - hope those windows work.

ecsbfe,"Bitcoin's ""seasonal"" research suggests that May next year may be the month when Bitcoin soars","The drop in bitcoin price has expanded below 7,000 points as pessimism is covering the entire cryptocurrency market.  Although at the end of 2019, the hype about BTC's halving is gradually heating up, but seasonal rules show that the BTC market may be relatively calm in the first quarter and then enter a strong period in the second quarter.

 In the traditional investment world, investors in different asset classes are familiar with seasonal patterns.  Bitcoin has been on the market for more than a decade.  The seasonality of this leading cryptocurrency has become something to watch for investors.  Data show that since July 2010, Bitcoin has performed the best monthly averages in April, May, October, and November.  On the other hand, the market was relatively calm during the first quarter of December, especially during the summer.
 What do you think about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecsbfe/bitcoins_seasonal_research_suggests_that_may_next/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-19 12:06:55,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecsbfe/bitcoins_seasonal_research_suggests_that_may_next/,NaN
ecstsb,"Will Bitcoin skyrocket in 2020? There are many good news news, how to deal with it?","For Bitcoin players, 2020 could be a promising year.
 First, Bitcoin may face a halving in May 2020. Second, the upcoming economic crisis and political uncertainty in the United States and globally will also provide Bitcoin with ideal conditions for rising in 2020.
 Generally speaking, such a strong rise is expected to attract a large number of new players seeking profiteering to enter the market, as at the end of 2017, when the madness not only swept bitcoin, but also took the entire currency circle, which gave birth  The huge speculative bubble led to a long bubble elimination period throughout 2018.
 Most people who buy bitcoin are too lazy to explore the value behind bitcoin. To be clear, bitcoin is just an emerging asset in their eyes, and it is better to follow the trend than to miss it.
 In the past 10 years, the price of bitcoin has risen from less than $ 1 to a maximum of $ 20,000, and even in the cold market now, it is worth $ 7,000.
 This kind of good performance almost does not exist in the traditional financial field, but the price increase data is not enough to show the revolutionary side of Bitcoin, nor can it reflect what it can bring to the world.
 If you decide to buy bitcoin, you must first understand how bitcoin builds a fairer currency system for everyone.  Second, you need to understand why the current monetary and financial system has flaws that cannot be repaired.  Once you find the answer, you will understand that Bitcoin is much more than an investment.
 The performance of Bitcoin over the past decade has greatly improved everyone's impression of it.  Until now, there are many people who want to become a millionaire through Bitcoin.  However, Bitcoin often relentlessly teaches those who are greedy.
 The wave of quotes at the end of 2017 is a good example.  We saw a lot of people getting rich as a result, but forgot that more people bought Bitcoin because of greed, and then lost more than 80% of their assets in the confusion.
 Although many people have escaped the disaster of falling from 20,000 US dollars, they have not been able to escape losses in other ways, such as believing in the big cake drawn by crooks, such as losing Bitcoin private keys, wallets, or simply surrendering and surrendering, surrendering in a rapid decline  Own chips.
 Whatever the market trend next year, we must be alert to the trap of greed.  Never forget the overriding principle of investing: ""Don't invest in money you can't afford to lose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecstsb/will_bitcoin_skyrocket_in_2020_there_are_many/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-19 12:56:05,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ecstsb/will_bitcoin_skyrocket_in_2020_there_are_many/,NaN

eczau0,Bitcoin UK capital gains / income? Help!,"Hi there, I would really appreciate it if someone could break this down for me as it‚Äôs, to me the most confusing thing in the world lol. 

I don‚Äôt understand how UK gov wants you to tax crypto. I‚Äôve read up on it and don‚Äôt understand it at all. 

Here‚Äôs my situation: 

Income: ¬£18K per year 

I have some social media accounts that are worth around ¬£5k I acquired them before twitter really blew up. I am looking to sell these for bitcoin as that is what is generally used to buy social media accounts. 

Once I‚Äôm paid for these what do I then need to do? 

I understand roughly I will need to sell the coin and deposit it into the bank. But then I‚Äôm at a loss when it comes to tax and declaring. 

I have been told it will be classed under capital gains tax but this doesn‚Äôt seem correct to me as the bitcoin is being used as currency not a ‚Äúasset‚Äù therefore will come under my income tax. I will literally be holding onto the bitcoin for a day or two. 

Secondly I‚Äôm told I don‚Äôt need to declare it. This seems a little odd to me. Surely the gov are going to want to know where this amount came from? And may suspect of me having a separate income. 

Not to mention UK govs confusing guide online. Talking about ‚Äúpooling‚Äù ‚ÄúTrading‚Äù (I‚Äôm thinking maybe what I‚Äôm doing is trading as im trading a account for bitcoin) AHH Help

ed5e00,Bitcoin Isn't Meant For Conventional Westphalianism (Republicanism)(Statism),"Let me give you an idea of the vantage point and perspective I come from. 

I \*am a quant, and a trader, and someone well read in law\* I hate wallstreet, because I understand how the western economy works, and obviously I understand the technicals of trading and quant work. So I know the angles they play. And I understand regulatory behavior, I have a background in environmental regulatory work ( left because it's corrupt no surprise).

You people obsessed with price at any cost or calling everything FUD have no long term view of things. If we get a economic collapse, a real crash, \*the happening\*, Bitcoin is going into the hundreds again. At this point, bitcoin is dependent on wallstreet, dependent on the same economy we supposedly disagree with. 

They've written the laws in the united state to only benefit the rich and institutions, and banned us off almost all exchanges. The only thing americans can use are basically three major names with piss poor liquidity and catastrophic fees. No one even talks about this. You HAVE to trade on unregulated exchanges to get by. Losing binance was a massive loss. The rich and powerful in united states have plans for bitcoin totally antithetical to cypherpunk.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't just need mainstream adoption, we need mainstream adoption of bitcoin WITH mainstream adoption of things like bisq and wasabi. This needs to become the norm, and yet they instead are planning on geofence locking bitcoin on a system of white listed exchanges, institutions, and wallets, trapping and tagging kyced bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing people have to realize is that the money laundering that is done, is done through Deutsche bank and HSBC and the likes, by the drug cartels, human right violating dictators, war criminals , shell companies for defense companies and spin offs of intelligence agencies. It's all done with cash and the us dollar and banks. The worst people who run the super PAC for election, the worse people who hold trillions offshore and dominate the third world with multinational corporations, Russian oligarchs, all of them use the system and its loop holes to do all the things that they are trying cite as a reason to impose on bitcoin all of these extreme regulations.

&amp;#x200B;

They want secrecy for themselves. Period. They want to control and oppress us, and use secrecy for themselves. Most of the reason western governments are broken is because of multinational conglomerate and monopolistic economic cartels buying out regulatory agencies. Period. It's called a inverted totalitarianism. (From Lawerence Lessig's Lost Republic). The economic cartels own the regulatory agencies. No regulatory body in the united states does what it really should do. But more often the opposite, specifically to protect industry, and their trillions offshore. The people who have all this wealth and control these profit entities don't even keep the money in the states or pay taxes. The truly rich live above the law while wrecking democracy. 

&amp;#x200B;

They want to have the ability to do the worst possible shit with the same level of secrecy that monero implies. So not only do we need encryption and privacy coins and features and anonymous untraceable access to bitcoin just to protect ourselves from them, we need to empower ourselves by having the same level of financial access that they do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it. What is the effect of the rich institutions making so many loopholes that allow them to move money and participate in functions of the market that the average person is prohibited from? It encourages and enables their ability to subvert democracy secretly with the very financial crimes they accuse of us.

&amp;#x200B;

So we need to take very deadly serious interchains and DAPP and DEX and DEFI, the wasabis, the mixers, monero, commerce adoption, and INFRASTRUCTURE that supports it. You people acting like maximalist can be so dense FFS. OPSEC. The world doesn't need bitcoin full node on backdoored windows 10 with zuck and the nsa watching you take a shit. The hardware and ancillary gear and infrastructure that supports bitcoin matters. Linux matters, user interface matters, commerce acceptance matters, server technology and security matters, even the processor matters, there are IBM and RISC V chips now,. The internet and bitcoin along with it needs to be violently dragged into open source models. Corporatization and closed gardening and the mcdonaldification of bitcoin is going to end in tragedy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin really is intended to be an anarchist apparatus. Bullshit to the citadel loving maximalist power tripping on some sort of libertarian randian american centric fantasy. You need to pay attention to why democracy doesn't work, why our political systems are broken, why these aspects of government only seem to empower the worst aspect of wallstreet criminality and financial crisis. Because it's how a late republic behaves, it's inherent in the flaws of republicanism, in electoral politics, in these hierarchical regulatory bodies, which are in no way self governing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our regulatory bodies are the literal opposite of *Don't trust, Verify*

but more *Don't verify, Trust.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ed5e00/bitcoin_isnt_meant_for_conventional/,samdane7777,1,2019-12-20 05:01:44,8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ed5e00/bitcoin_isnt_meant_for_conventional/,NaN
ed5zok,"Tried gambling with bitcoin on Bodog but they wouldn‚Äôt give back my coins! Yet another place that is doing crypto wrong, and really I‚Äôm losing faith with anyone actually using crypto.","I wanted to try and see how bitcoin gambling works so signed up a fake person and deposited a tiny amount of money 0.0012 coins. Did some gambling in fiat (they convert it, you can‚Äôt gamble with actual bitcoins, which was immediately disappointing). I quadrupled my money betting on sports, so had about $40 in the account. I did a test withdrawal of $10 to see how that works, and they just froze my account. 

I chatted with tech support, gave them all kinds of info, which i think was correct (I did make up a fake person) and then they asked me to call.  I don‚Äôt really want to do that just to prove my identity, as that would kind of defeat the purpose of using this payment method, so they can keep my 0.0012 coins. 

It seems to me that everything was alright while they had my money but giving it up was a little harder for them. 

The whole point of crypto is to have some level of anonymity. I know money laundering and stuff, but they have a clause where you can only withdraw money you‚Äôve actually already bet, which I did since I was just withdrawing winnings, so that can‚Äôt be the problem. 

This is all quite disappointing because I want crypto to work and I want to use it in my life but I just keep losing money. I used Quadriga as my exchange and whatever I was using for trading is gone.  (I did have coins in various other wallets so I didn‚Äôt lose all). Tried gambling with it. No go.  Only thing i find it useful for is paying my VPN.  And even that didn‚Äôt work for a couple of months as they were changing their payment processor. Can you imagine someone not taking a MasterCard for a month while they get a new card reader installed?

Getting fiat out of coins is also far far too onerous.  Quadriga went under. In Canada, coinbase will only take fiat but not give it back. When I tried authenticating with kraken it somehow failed, required many emails to tech support and then I just gave up as it wasn‚Äôt worth it (I provided persona info which you have to do to for them to send fiat, it was stuck on ‚Äúin progress‚Äù)

TL DR; this turned into a rant, but don‚Äôt give your coins to a major betting platform. They know how to take the coins but not how to give them back.  This is, along with many other failures with crypto is making me want to just give up crypto altogether.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ed5zok/tried_gambling_with_bitcoin_on_bodog_but_they/,Was_Silly,1,2019-12-20 05:59:22,20,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ed5zok/tried_gambling_with_bitcoin_on_bodog_but_they/,NaN

ed8tcl,I wrote an offline Bitcoin block explorer that loads data from Bitcoin Core and allows you to explore the blockchain on your PC,"Dear /r/Bitcoin, I wrote a set of tools to import data from .bitcoin/blocks/blkXXXXX.dat files into databases and allow you to explore the blockchain on your own PC by running ad-hoc queries of all the main Bitcoin Core data structures including blocks, TX's, inputs, outputs, addresses and more. 

It's written in C++ and uses Bitcoin Core itself to read the data, so it's always 100% compliant with the latest Bitcoin release. I abstracted away the database functions, so you can implement ""drivers"" for any other DB system. I've been playing with it on MySQL but perhaps others would prefer Neo4J or Cassandra for nosql graph analysis.

Once the data is loaded, you can run any database query against it. 

I implemented a simple reference Python interface to it so you can play with the blockchain. I made this outer layer in Python but any other language can be easily plugged in, including big data analysis systems like Spark or Hadoop.

Some stuff you can do with it:

* Trace any Bitcoin address funds by building a graph
* Run  your own local block explorer without any external API
* Add and subtract inputs/outputs to build whatever statistics
* Plug in viz modules to output graphical stuff from the data

While loading the block files it does some additional work :

* Creates an index of block position in .dat files. Bitcoin Core does this but access to the index is locked while Core is running. With Toolbox you can play with this data even while Bitcoin Core is running independently. With this index you can go back to the raw data any time. This can be turned into a website service and exposed via an API
* Generates a address graph, resolving previous outputs from inputs and building a DB table with source and destination TX's and addresses side by side. It's like a WWW block explorer in your own database which you can query in any way.

Addresses, TX's and all other data structures are decoded by Bitcoin Core itself. The C++ Toolbox links to Bitcoin Core and uses the canonical implementation, so the loaded data is accurate. The Python reference implementation is almost 100% independent from the C++ code (except for configuration code which shares the same parameters and config file as the C++ Toolbox). 

Released under the MIT license.

I hope you like playing with it!

edlw3m,Bitcoin changes life,"This is awkward. I have never done this before.

I grew up in an Asian city, with the highest house price in the world and diminishing freedom.

My parents raised me up, both worked as low class worker. They always hope I would be better than them.

I did not let them down and got a degree in business. I thought this would bring changes to the family.

Nope. In this abnormal society, you work hard just to struggle for a living. I can put food on the table. And that's it.

With the frugal life I still cant save enough to afford the housing. I always thought I could give my parents a comfy life.

They have been working hard for their entire life like a machine. They are now getting old and have around 10 years remaining if they have the average lifespan. This thought frightens me. I wish i had the ability to provide more to them.

If you have the ability please help me out. I promise I will repay you. I hope you can change my life and I could have the ability to change at least 3 more people's life in the future. I don't want to paste a bitcoin address here. Instead I would post my email. Talk to me, get to know me more. Thank you.

I‚Äôve tried Coinbase, but while it‚Äôs been simple to set up and buy, they limit my purchase to $250/week and also charge a very high fee, almost 5% of my purchase. 

I‚Äôve tried Binance, but their portals like Koinal have had reports of scams and missing BTC. 

I‚Äôm in the process of getting verified by Kraken, but their support emailed me this today ‚Äúto complete your account verification, we must ask you to provide an ID Confirmation Photo.

What the hell is this? I didn‚Äôt even need this to create a TFSA account, now they want a picture of me holding up my ID to my face?

ee2lrf,What the upcoming years might hold in store for bitcoin (a technical outlook by John Newbery),"*John Newbery is a developer contributing to Bitcoin Core and to various educational resources like Bitcoin Optech.* 

*Original source is here:* [*https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/1208559196465184768*](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/1208559196465184768)*. Keep in mind that the text below is copied from Twitter, so the formatting/phrasing might seem a little strange*

\---------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

The end of the decade is a good time to look back and marvel at the giant strides that Bitcoin has made since Satoshi gave us the whitepaper in 2008. It's also a natural point to look forward to what the upcoming years might hold in store.

This is where I think Bitcoin is headed over the next few years. Tell me why I'm wrong and what I've missed!

The lightning protocol teams working on c-lightning ([@Blockstream](https://twitter.com/Blockstream)), eclair ([@acinq\_co](https://twitter.com/acinq_co)), LND ([@lightning](https://twitter.com/lightning)) and rust lightning will continue to iterate rapidly on the lightning protocol.

All implementations now support basic multi-path payments ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/multipath-payments/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/multipath-payments/)). We'll get better support of that as well as dual-funding, splice-in and splice-out ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/)).

Taken together, those technologies will make channel and liquidity management much easier. They'll be automated, fade into the background and user experience will improve drastically.

Lightning infrastructure will improve. [@bitfinex](https://twitter.com/bitfinex) recently added lightning deposits and withdrawals. All other exchanges, merchant service providers, custodians and wallets will follow suit or become obsolete.

We'll see more lightning wallets: a mix of non-custodial; self-custodied with outsourced routing; and fully-self-managed wallets. This is a brand new space and there'll be lots of experimentation. Different teams will find different niches to fill.

Already, wallets like [@MuunWallet](https://twitter.com/MuunWallet), [@Breez\_Tech](https://twitter.com/Breez_Tech), [@PhoenixWallet](https://twitter.com/PhoenixWallet), [@ln\_zap](https://twitter.com/ln_zap)and [@bluewalletio](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio) are experimenting with different models.

Tooling for lightning developers will improve. When we ran the lightning apps residency just over a year ago, the attendees spent a lot of time setting up their lightning dev environments.

Now, with Polar ([ https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar ](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar)) by [@jamaljsr](https://twitter.com/jamaljsr), lightning app developers can set up a test environment with a few clicks. More and better tools will continue to appear.

With better tooling, we'll see faster innovation on the application layer. Teams at [@zebedeeio](https://twitter.com/zebedeeio), [@SatoshisGames](https://twitter.com/SatoshisGames), and others we haven't heard of yet will delight us with new and unexpected lightning experiences.

The schnorr/taproot softfork ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/)) will be activated in 2020 or 2021. That'll provide a huge improvement in fungibility, privacy, scalability and functionality. For an overview of the benefits, watch the Optech exec briefing here: [ https://bitcoinops.org/en/2019-exec-briefing/#the-next-softfork ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/2019-exec-briefing/#the-next-softfork).

That'll allow lightning to upgrade from HTLCs to Payment Points. That's a big improvement for privacy and payment decorrelation, and allows 'Stuckless payments' with proofs-of-payment -- another huge boost in LN usablity.

See the [@suredbits](https://twitter.com/suredbits) series of blog posts here [ https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/ ‚Ä¶](https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/) for more details on Payment Points.

Even better, lightning channel opens and closes will look identical to payments to single pubkeys. The same is true for payments to k-of-n pubkey thresholds. That's good for fungibility, privacy and scalability.

In fact, with schnorr/taproot, there's almost no downside to encumbering UTXOs with advanced scripts instead of single pubkey outputs.

Cold storage UTXOs will be k-of-n multisig keytrees, and all hot wallet UTXOs will be stored in channels (with splicing-out used to make on-chain payments). When transactions hit the chain, they'll look like any other single pubkey/signature payment.

Payments into wallets will pay directly into channel open outputs (thanks to [@esneider](https://twitter.com/esneider) for pointing this out to me). There'll be no concept of an on-chain balance and an in-channel balance. Just a single, unified balance that can be used for lightning or on-chain payments.

Wallet teams will collaborate on a PayJoin payment protocol ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payjoin/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payjoin/)). A large number of on-chain transactions will be 2-input-2-ouput transactions, vastly improving fungibility and privacy, and foiling chain analysis.

The inputs to those PayJoin transactions may be channel splice-outs, and the outputs may be channel opens, but there'll be no way to tell from observing the chain.

Eventually we'll have cross-input signature aggregation ([ https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/#signature-aggregation ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/#signature-aggregation)), which means those PayJoin transactions will only have a single signature, and will be \*cheaper\* than regular change-producing transactions.

Larger coinjoins will be cheaper still. An advanced PayJoin payment protocol could even batch multiple payments to the same merchant/exchange and use only a single signature.

We'll get SIGHASH\_NOINPUT or SIGHASH\_ANYPREVOUT ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash\_noinput/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash_noinput/)), making eltoo ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/)) possible, and blurring the lines between layer 1 and layer 2 ([ https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-September/002136.html ‚Ä¶](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-September/002136.html)).

That'll make lightning even more usable and allow more advanced layer 2 contracts like channel factories ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-factories/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-factories/)).

All these advanced features will require greater wallet interoperability. That's where miniscript ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/ ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/)) comes in.

With miniscript, wallets will eventually be able to enter contracts with each other that don't require pre-templated scripts (as lightning currently does). This wallet interoperability will allow faster innovation in layer 2 contracts.

OP\_CTV ([ https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2019/12/04/#op-checktemplateverify-ctv ‚Ä¶](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2019/12/04/#op-checktemplateverify-ctv)) or some other covenant-enabling opcode will be activated, allowing richer layer 2 constructions like joinpools ([ https://freenode.irclog.whitequark.org/bitcoin-wizards/2019-05-21#1558427254-1558427441 ‚Ä¶](https://freenode.irclog.whitequark.org/bitcoin-wizards/2019-05-21#1558427254-1558427441);).

Taken together with taproot and SIGHASH\_NOINPUT, we'll get extremely rich and private off-chain contracts will be made possible.

Some of these things will happen in 2020, and some will take a bit longer, but they're all heading in the same direction: using the chain for what the chain's good for (h/t Andrew Poelstra).

That's to say: the block chain allows nodes to arrive at an agreed ledger state, while contracting and functionality move up onto layer two. Doing so is cheaper, more secure, more private and allows for more rapid innovation.

None of this is inevitable, and none can happen without the industry of many hands and the creativity of many minds. There are years of work ahead for developers, researchers, businesses and users.

If you run a Bitcoin business, you can help by supporting, sponsoring or hiring open source developers.  


If you're a Bitcoin user, you can help by \*demanding\* that any service you use supports the open source ecosystem.

If you're a developer, you can help by reviewing and testing PRs and releases. [ https://bitcoincore.reviews/ ](https://bitcoincore.reviews/) is a great place to start.

2020 is going to be a great year for Bitcoin and Lightning protocol development!

I've been doing the initial sync of blockchain in bitcoin core for some weeks on a Lenovo Thinkpad x201 (i5 first gen, 4gb ram, 500gb hard drive, internet of 200mb/s of download and 100mb/s of upload without limits)

I'm using Linux (kali linux for be more precise) and the sync is 47.50% ready at the moment.

My problem is that the progress is not being saved.

I was at 48.70% yesterday and then closed the program, idk why but i couldn't close on a normal way, Linux had a pop up saying ""Bitcoin core isn't working, click here to close"" and then i lost the progress, this happened not only yesterday but multiple times in last 1 week.

Could someone help me to fix this?

eee1m8,"How would *you* define a Bitcoin ""full node""?","So **before you comment** allow me to elaborate a bit.

I find that many people appear to have different definitions for this term, including some developers if I recall correctly *(although I can't exactly recall who)*.

One might think that after 10 years there would be some conclusive agreement on this term, as well as agreed upon phrases for ""alternative"" states a node could be in, but from what I can observe there doesn't seem to consensus on this front.

I want to avoid blaming anyone specific for making this term more confusing, despite there being a number of people who are Ethereum developers and/or fans that are of the opinion that these terms can mean something different depending on what blockchain one is referring to *(of which I vehemently disagree with)*.

Let us assume that it's agreed upon that ""full validation"" is ""the act of fully validating every block, and transaction, from beginning to end"", and if one is to consider a blockchain like Ethereum, then this would include all of the intermediary chainstates, because they contain contract computation that would otherwise be lost *(whether one agrees this is ""necessary"" or not)*, but this post isn't about Ethereum so let's put that aside for this.

So we have a few phrases:

* **""Full Validation"":** The act of fully validating every block, and transaction, from beginning to end.
* **""Fully Validated"":** The condition/state of having completed ""full validation"" up to some arbitrary block height.
* **""Full Node"":** ???

Now, you *might* be saying ""a full node is one that fully validated"", and I would agree, but apparently not everyone does, so allow me to continue for a moment so I can properly delineate to the best of my ability what I've observed and what I believe to be the ""best"" Schelling points for how one might define a ""full node"":

1. Has your node **actually gone through the process** of fully validating every block? *(Does not necessarily keep all of the blockchain data required to repeat the process, so it could be in a pruned state.)*
2. Does your node **have all the data required to perform** the act of full validation? Equivalently &amp; Alternatively: Can your node provide another user with all the data required to perform the act of full validation? *(Does not necessarily fully validate the entire blockchain from beginning to end, but it cannot be in a pruned state since it then could not share the necessary data.)*
3. Your node has definitively both **1) gone through the process of full validation and 2) still has all the data** required to re-perform full validation and/or share the data required for another user to fully validate.

With these differing definitions in place, which one would you say is the best way to define the term ""full node""?

Do you have any alternative sets of conditions that I haven't conceived *(whether or not you may actually agree with your conditions)*?

Here's a Twitter poll where I ask the same question: https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/1208907659249934336",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eee1m8/how_would_you_define_a_bitcoin_full_node/,StopAndDecrypt,1,2019-12-23 02:16:13,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eee1m8/how_would_you_define_a_bitcoin_full_node/,NaN

eefhx9,A few questions about bitcoin mining,"Newbie here. 

I'm not yet familiar with bitcoin mining, just a bit interested. The bitcoin block header, as we all know, is consisted of the nonce, the timestamp, the Merkle root, nBits, and the hash of the previous block. Miners usually increment the nonce by 1, until they exhaust all 2\^32 possibilities and find the solution. 

However, I have read that it is very common for miners to exhaust all 2\^32 combinations and not find a solution at all. As a result, they have to make slight changes to the timestamp and/or the Merkle root to calculate even more combinations. 

Therefore, what is the probability of a miner exhausting 2\^32 combinations without finding a valid nonce in a specific block? Does it have something to do with the bitcoin mining ""difficulty"" thingy?

eefxy1,Bitcoin 4 year ROI is minimum 5.2x and majority of the time over 10x,"I was just curious what the historical returns were if you were to buy Bitcoin at any date and sold exactly 4 years later, be it bull market or bear market.  The result was beyond my expectations.

Below is the chart where x axis is the date and **y-axis is the log (base 10) return of 4 year wait**, where it bottoms sometime early 2013 (sell date of early 2017) with value \`0.72\` (10\^0.72 being 5.24x) and majority of the time stays above value 1.0, which is 10x return.

Why 4 years? Due to halving events many people seem to this 4 year is the magic number so I gave it a try.

Just another reason to motivate yourself to hold for at least 4 years, who knows history might just repeat itself.

 But hardware wallets are expensive.  Therefore, he said that the second best option in this case is to download the wallet on a smartphone.  He further stated that since the security of desktop wallets is much lower than the security of downloading from mobile phones, he suggested that users only use desktop wallets in conjunction with hardware wallets, that is, keys are generated and stored in hardware wallets, and  Not on a general operating system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eek2f8/bitcoin_security_expert_cryptocurrency_wallets/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-23 12:33:23,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eek2f8/bitcoin_security_expert_cryptocurrency_wallets/,NaN

ef077n,A Truly Decentralized Bitcoin Gambling Game,"A Truly Decentralized Bitcoin Gambling Game

You have got a chance to gamble some Bitcoin in a truly decentralized
manner! No those centralized Bitcoin pseudo-""casions"" websites that are
provably unfair!

This is nothing like you ever seen before. It's a completely new era of
Internet gambling. No house, just real peer-to-peer gambling. And it's
STUPIDLY EASY to play!

Don't forget to gamble responsibly! If you are addicted to gambling or
otherwise have a problem with it, please look here:
https://www.helpguide.org/articles/addictions/gambling-addiction-and-problem-gambling.htm

Here's how it works:

1. You send some Bitcoins to address at your lucky number (at least
0.001 BTC, that is 1mBTC or 1000uBTC).
2. You replace address at the lucky number with your own.
3. You further send this message on forums, social media/networking
sites/apps, instant messengers, private/direct messages, chat rooms, etc.
4. Other people repeat this actions and if you'll get lucky, chances are
that other people will send Bitcoins to your address! For each person
you'll win 0.001 BTC!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are curious and want to play, here is how you do:

1. If you don't have Bitcoins yet, get them the way you want to. There
are many ways to earn Bitcoins online. You can just buy them also the
way you want to.

2. Copy&amp;paste this message to text editor/memos app on your phone.
If you don't have one on your phone, I would recommend Google Keep:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep

* On a computer, left-click the mouse on beginning of the message. Then,
scroll down, press&amp;hold Shift and without releasing it, left-click the
mouse on the end of the message. Now you can release Shift key. Then,
open your text editor/memo app and paste this message by pressing Ctrl+V
(Cmd+V on Mac).

* On mobile, scroll this message up to the beginning. Hold the beginning
of the message. Then, use that little blue circles to scroll down to the
end of message and select it as a whole. Tap Copy. Then, switch an app,
press&amp;hold a text field and tap Paste.


3. Choose your lucky number from 1 to 6, or if you are unsure, roll the
dice.
If you don't have access to real dice or don't want to use it (extremely
common among mobile users), use this true RNG-based (random number
generator) dice roller: https://www.random.org/dice/?num=1


4. Now as you have selected your lucky number or rolled the dice, send
AT LEAST 0.001 BTC/1mBTC/1000uBTC to the address at your lucky number.

I hope you know how to do it, but in case you are a newbie, here are the
steps:

* Highlight the address with your lucky number either with your mouse by
double-clicking on it or by pressing&amp;holding it on the touch screen.
* Press Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac) at the same time to copy the address, or
right-click and click Copy in a context menu. For mobile users, tap Copy
button.
* Now you go on the wallet app and paste the address by pressing Ctrl+V
at the same time or right-clicking on a sending address field and
clicking Paste. For mobile users, press&amp;hold the field and tap Paste button.
* Send an amount of at the least 0.001 BTC at a pretty much any
transaction fee

(If you are a tech savvy user and something changes, change the text
above so less tech-savvy users are able to participate in this game as well)

List of Bitcoin addresses in game:
First
1. 13eRmB2VUrzAUSDrgf72HcJJFok7Yz1vnM
2. 1GntngcAgofNXpRL2LvUMHSA7cMbBjdHUx
3. 1ERfw7DZaRNUMrCk4iiSXBRE6BkKwNHPfY

5. 1EHeGgJzoDE3z9ExgdjX2cix858qGdq7cM
6. 1f27wMz8uy3LWTHLATppVeYGjdzkqTbr7
Last

5. Now as you have sent Bitcoins to your selected address, remove it and
replace it with your own.

If you don't know how, I will explain you the way:

* Go to your wallet app, then copy your address.
* Return to this message and double-click on an address for whom you
have sent Bitcoins. Then press Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on mac) or right-click &gt; Paste.
* On mobile, press&amp;hold an address and tap Paste.

(If you are a tech savvy user and something changes, change the text
above so less tech-savvy users are able to participate in this game as well)

Now it's the final step.

6. Send this message further on forums, social media/networking
sites/apps, instant messengers, private/direct messages, chat rooms, etc.

* Copy this text with a keyboard by pressing Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+C.
With a mouse, right-click &gt; Select All and right click &gt; Copy.
* To paste this text with a keyboard, press Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac). With
a mouse, right-click &gt; Paste.
* On a mobile device, to copy &amp; paste, press&amp;hold this message. Then tap
""Select All"" and ""Copy"". Then, switch the app, press&amp;hold text field and
tap Paste.

ef18qw,What are the advantages and disadvantages of investing in Bitcoin?,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of investing in Bitcoin?
 First, the advantages of Bitcoin:
 1. It is completely decentralized. Without an issuing institution, it is impossible to manipulate the number of issuances.  Its distribution and circulation are achieved through the open source p2p algorithm.
 2. Anonymity, tax exemption, and supervision.
 3. Bitcoin is robust.  Bitcoin is completely dependent on the p2p network and has no distribution center, so it cannot be closed externally.  The price of Bitcoin may fluctuate and collapse. Many governments may declare it illegal, but Bitcoin and Bitcoin ‚Äôs huge p2p network will not disappear.
 4. Easy cross-border transactions.
 Cross-border remittances will go through layers of foreign exchange control agencies, and transaction records will be recorded by multiple parties.  But if you are trading with Bitcoin, enter the digital address directly, click the mouse, and wait for the p2p network to confirm the transaction, and a lot of funds will pass.  No cross-border transaction record will be left without going through any regulatory agency.
 5. Difficult to copy.
 Second, the disadvantages of Bitcoin:
 1. The fragility of the trading platform.  The Bitcoin network is robust, but the Bitcoin trading platform is fragile.  The trading platform is usually a website, but now APP software is formed to increase the stability of the platform, and the website will be hacked.

 2. The transaction confirmation takes a long time.  When a Bitcoin wallet is first installed, it consumes a lot of time to download historical transaction data blocks.

 3. The price fluctuates greatly.  A large number of speculators have stepped in, resulting in large fluctuations in the price of bitcoin for cash.  Makes Bitcoin more suitable for speculation, or long-term transactions rather than anonymous transactions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ef18qw/what_are_the_advantages_and_disadvantages_of/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-24 13:17:35,7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ef18qw/what_are_the_advantages_and_disadvantages_of/,NaN

efa8ru,"Buying bitcoin will end the protests in Uzbekistan, Hong Kong, Iraq, Iran, and Bolivia!","No, buying bitcoin won't stop the protests and make the governments of those countries cave to the will of their own people. Get out of your pipe dream.

Now then, Bitcoin can be a tool to help traffic funds to and from the people in those countries, but let me break down the arguments piece by piece:              

-Hong Kong protests: Zero relation to economy. All related to human rights.                
-Uzbekistan: Overselling oil to Russia and China, not enough oil for their own citizens.             
-Iraq: Political corruption, inadequate basic utilities for the masses (running water and electricity).              
-Iran: Hiking oil prices for their citizens, making subsidence in daily life nearly impossible.             
-Bolivia: Political corruption, rigged elections.           

While I get the enthusiasm for the internet of money that can be sent anywhere to anyone without restrictions and then converted to cash one way or another, you have to use your head. Bloodshed does not help bitcoin. **people buying and using bitcoin is good for bitcoin.**

efjiky,Laszlo Hanyecz and The $80MM Bitcoin Pizza,"So today I have an interesting story.

This one is pretty CRAZY, and could in affect get more crazy in the future as I'll explain at the end...

The story revolves around a dude by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer.

And it begins on May 18th 2010.

&amp;#x200B;

The setting? The BitcoinTalk forums.

These are OG forums for the early adopters of Bitcoin, and there are some legendary discussions from the early days like [this one](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0).

At the time, 1 Bitcoin was less than a cent, and Laszlo offered to pay 10,000 bitcoins (around $41 at the time) for a couple of pizzas.

&amp;#x200B;

Three days after his offer didn't have any suitors, Laszlo proclaimed:

""So nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?""

He goes on:

""I just think it would be interesting if I could say that I paid for a pizza in bitcoins""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the next day, his wish was answered as a user by the name of [jercos](https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/index/jercosinterview) traded two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. 

Here is [proof of that transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d) by the way. Very cool.

Also check out the value when transacted!

1 Bitcoin was less than a cent.

&amp;#x200B;

The real name of jercos?

Jeremy Sturdivant. 

He was just 18 years old at the time of the transaction in 2010.

Now, 10,000 Bitcoin is the equivalent of $72MM today!

Or at the time of [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWU3O3X5kKE), $80MM.

When asked if he regretted paying 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas, Laszlo emphasised the fact that he got to play a crucial role in the early adoption of Bitcoin and be part of history.

Of course, he also started the tradition of Bitcoin Pizza Day, held on the 22nd May annually to celebrate the first ever use of Bitcoin to buy pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets worse though:

After that first pizza purchase in 2010, Laszlo continued to spend his Bitcoin - in fact he told Cooper Anderson that he had spent around 100,000 Bitcoin, much of it on pizza.

Today, that is the equivalent of around $720,000,000!

&amp;#x200B;

This story could get even crazier in the coming years.

The next Bitcoin Halving occurs in May 2020, check out the [Bitcoin Halving video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82e9ItjxS5U) for more on that.

One of the unique aspects of Bitcoin as an asset is the fact that there is a finite total supply (21 MILLION BITCOIN) and pre-programmed supply SCHEDULE provided by these halving events. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: this is not investment advice and is for entertainment purposes only.

Let's have a look at how much those two pizzas (10,000 Bitcoin) could be worth at different (HYPOTHETICAL) prices for Bitcoin:

&amp;#x200B;

IF Bitcoin hit $10,000, THEN that would be $100MM

IF Bitcoin hit $100,000, THEN that would be $1B

IF Bitcoin hit $1,000,000, THEN that would be $10BN

&amp;#x200B;

Now of course these are hypothetical price points, but how amazing would it be if those two pizzas ended up being worth billions of dollars?

efkan7,"If I were a commerce (restaurant, whatever) how should I accept Bitcoin?","First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!

I recently went to a restaurant and my mind was full-working thinking about how hard would be (on the restaurant side) accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.

1.- How ‚Äúinstant‚Äù would be the payment to be received? 10 minutes? How many ‚Äúconfirmations‚Äù would be needed to be considered as ‚Äúfully and confirmed paid‚Äù?

2.- Wouldn‚Äôt be a problem having a unique wallet since every transaction would be public? How hard would be implementing a multi-wallet option or even a single-use wallet for that transaction?

3.- Bearing in mind how volatile the market is, let‚Äôs say you print the bill now (7170.55$) and when the end-user has to pay... it reaches 7500$ (wow). Wouldn‚Äôt this be a problem? I know: this is how market works, right? It happens with Forex, but it‚Äôs not supposed to be THAT volatile... right?

I‚Äôm just thinking about how hard would be convincing a ‚Äúloser‚Äù  user to implement BTC payments, since I‚Äôve been dealing with crypto since 2017.

efkhos,History time: Tell us how you found about Bitcoin and how has it changed your life,"I found BTC in 2011 when Creepypastas where a thing all over YouTube, I watched some dude's video about the deep web and how you could find everything you couldn't find on the ""surface web"".

I downloaded TOR, went through some sites out of curiosity (mostly fake ID sellers) and noticed this weird symbol ‚Çø I had never seen before.

I did some research of what it meant and I found some sellers accepting PayPal so I bought $30 worth of BTC (close to 15 BTC at that time) and continued browsing the deep web, then I forgot about the whole thing for the next 6 years...

In June 2017, I saw a local news article on how well Bitcoin had been performing throughout 2017, then it hit me: HOLY SHT I HAD SOME OF THOSE COINS, luckily I was able to find my keys and move those coins to an upgraded wallet.

When BTC hit $18,000 I sold 3 coins to help my parents remodel their restaurant, and paid their mortgage (a big ""F*** you"" to the bank in behalf of Satoshi lol).. Now we have a bigger, more beautiful and successful restaurant, no mortgage debt and I still have 12 coins left which I won't sell in the short term, not even to buy a new car.

Thanks Bitcoin, thanks Satoshi for helping us on our fight against abusive interest rates from bank loans and thanks to all the community for keeping this project alive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/efkhos/history_time_tell_us_how_you_found_about_bitcoin/,CryptoRegio,1,2019-12-25 19:17:55,32,/r/Bitcoin/comments/efkhos/history_time_tell_us_how_you_found_about_bitcoin/,NaN

efmo27,Aren't Stablecoins better than Bitcoin for payments ?,"Bitcoin as an investment is different, I am talking about the Bitcoin for payment purposes

Many stores acceept Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency these days. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility is a huge issue. Recent I bought a $1000 product from a merchant. I sent him $1000 worth of Bitcoin but at the time he received it it was worth $960 which caused a lot of issues. Not only Bitcoin price fluctates a lot, there also are big price differences between crypto exchanges. Bitcoin transactions alse take long and transaction fees are high.

Doesn't using Tether or or Stablecoins make much more sense ? I could simply sent him 1000USDT and knew that he will receive $1000.

I ended up moving the guest disk image to another drive by simply copying the VM file. My concern is that the guest machine is hosting corrupt data, and none of the operations I have tried are hitting the disk long enough to actually validate the whole thing (e.g. bitcoin-cli verifychain runs for like 2 seconds and returns true).

Without re-downloading the entire chain, is there an rsync-like way to compare my entire chain to others and make sure the data actually matches? Trying to sync a node in 2019 would be extremely painful and the whole point of running a VM was so I'd never have to.

egal1q,"Bitcoin has doubled this year, why is anyone still suffering?","1.From the results, in 2019, Bitcoin is pretty good, and the price is nearly doubled.  It is basically in line with the expectations at the beginning of the year, and the benchmark in 2015 has basically the same increase.

 2. However, the process was unexpected.  When everyone was preparing for the cold winter, the first half of the year suddenly surged.  When everyone thought that the bear market was over, the second half of the year was cut.

 3. Imagine that if it has been rising steadily from the beginning of the year to today, everyone should feel good now.  However, most people will feel uncomfortable when the situation ends.

 4. Why?  Many people lose after soaring first and then plunging.  And if it rises smoothly from the beginning of the year to today, everyone feels profitable.

 5. In fact, the cost from the beginning of the investment to the present is about $ 6200, at least not to lose money.  The reason for the loss is either that they did not hold themselves in the middle, or that the time to start the fixed vote was wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/egal1q/bitcoin_has_doubled_this_year_why_is_anyone_still/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-27 12:25:31,26,/r/Bitcoin/comments/egal1q/bitcoin_has_doubled_this_year_why_is_anyone_still/,NaN

Intimidation has been received in 7,000 to 8,000 locations in Moscow alone.  According to statistics, these intimidations have led to the evacuation of 770,000 people.
 Some analysts believe that these threats are related to Bitcoin.  The reason is that many of these false alerts are accompanied by a message requesting the settlement of 120 bitcoins (close to 800,000 euros at current prices).  The rumors allege that Russian rich Constantine Malofeev ""stolen"" the money from the trading platform WEX.

egan7q,"3.61 million bitcoins lost, is it good news for bitcoin holders?","According to the Coin Metrics report, it is assumed that the lost Bitcoin includes addresses for destruction (2213), wallet vulnerabilities (2609), and no mobile addresses for many years (1.4969 million).  According to Chainalysis research, according to estimates of long-term holders, frequency of transfers, and strategic investors, it is believed that about 3 million cannot be recovered.  According to Chain.info research, the total amount of UTXO was classified and estimated at three time points in 2013, 2014, and 2017, and it was found that there were about 3.61 million BTC lost, accounting for 20%.  From the perspective of the distribution of bitcoin holdings over the past five years, the proportion of bitcoin holdings over five years has reached 21.62%, and most of this part has actually been withdrawn from circulation.
 At present, the market value of bitcoin is 909.085 billion yuan. If the lost amount is eliminated (20% has been lost), the actual market value after removal is 728.391 billion yuan. The inflation rate of bitcoin is maintained at about 3.6%.  The actual annual inflation rate is about 4.5%, corresponding to the actual annual inflation rate after the block reward halved next year will be about 2.2%.  So the good news is that permanently lost bitcoin is a kind of ""subsidy"" for long-term holders, but the bad news is that the substantial drop in real inflation and private key loss rates is ""cutting"" long-term holder subsidies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/egan7q/361_million_bitcoins_lost_is_it_good_news_for/,Emma5201,1,2019-12-27 12:32:17,37,/r/Bitcoin/comments/egan7q/361_million_bitcoins_lost_is_it_good_news_for/,NaN

egf1mg,"Bitcoin, Iran and Europe","**TL&amp;DR:** What is the simplest way to exit money from Iran to Europe (legally!) using Bitcoin?

Hello,  
A friend of mine (not at all interested in Bitcoin for speculation/investment) has asked me about Bitcoin for the following reason. He is originally from Iran but he moved to Europe (France and Switzerland) for about 40 years now. He recently got some money in Iran thanks to some heritage. However, due to US sanctions, it's not possible at the moment to simply sell the money, convert to EURO and receive the money in his EU bank. Thus he had this idea to circumvent sanctions  


(1) somehow buy Bitcoin in Iran with local currency

(2) sell the bitcoin in Europe.  


So my questions are two, and I'd be very grateful if any Iranian fellow, or anybody with experience, could help:  


**Q1:** what is the simplest way to get (relatively high amounts of) bitcoin in Iran using money currently staying in a Iranian bank (as opposed to cash)? Do they have something like Coinbase? My friend is quite old and he's searching a simple and secure way to do stuff, even if there are some fees. Not crazy hackerish/technical solutions. Also, he does not live in Iran, as I said, so He needs to do things online and not in the street.

**Q2:** Assuming he gets bitcoins in Iran, what are the procedures (if any) to declare these bitcoin in Europe (France/Switzerland), their source, and convert them to EURO in a ""100% legal way""? My friend is not at all interested in breaking any European/Swiss law.

egflw9,What nobody usually mentions about Bitcoin.,"At current prices almost $13,000,000 of new bitcoins are mined every day. That almost $5 billion a year. These have to be absorbed constantly just to keep the price stable. 

When the price drops like to 6500 or really any price, I think about all the new money needed to absorb the supply. I am always amazed it doesn‚Äôt drop more. From time to time I buy a little more when prices drop. 

The halving will cut the current 1800 new bitcoins a day to 900. If the price goes to $20,000 that will be $18,000,000 a day after halving. 

My point is this. I have no idea what price bitcoin will be next year or even in a few years. But I am exceedingly confident in the long term and every time the price drops but doesn‚Äôt continue to drop, it makes me realize just how strong bitcoin is, even with 1800 new bitcoins every day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/egflw9/what_nobody_usually_mentions_about_bitcoin/,foomev2,1,2019-12-27 19:29:14,159,/r/Bitcoin/comments/egflw9/what_nobody_usually_mentions_about_bitcoin/,NaN

eghq7v,Major Bitcoin Scams Running Through Fake Binance Youtube Livestreams,"Hey guys. So I'm an avid support of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I run my own youtube channel trying to share news and information shared publicly about the industry when I a couple weeks ago was looking around on youtube and came across what appeared to be a ""Binance"" livestream. Upon a very thorough investigation and talking with the support staff at Binance it is concluded that these are massive scams. Of the 4 I have listed below in this screenshot I have confirmed at least 2 of them people have fallen prey and sent them Bitcoins in thinking it is a giveaway that is going to give them Bitcoins back. There are supposedly thousands of people watching these livestreams. 

Binance told me a couple years ago that they were taking care of it. Now there's even more of these channels going up and the last time I spoke to a rep from Binance they said they informed youtube and are trying to take care of it. It's been week after week and frankly, even though I'm not the one being scammed, this disgusts me that these people are getting away with it AND it also makes the industry look shady and puts a bad reputation on Binance, which to be perfectly honest I don't want to have as I feel Binance is a great exchange overall and I want to see them doing well. 

I even tried tagging their Binance twitter account and they gave me no time of day. I'm resorting to here on Reddit. I'm not very familiar with using Reddit but people have told me there's great communities here. 

This problem is only going to get worse. I've been trying to get help to shut these fake channels down. Any ideas guys? 

Also here's a youtube video I made going over how they're scamming people from a previous livestream. Was hoping this would raise some more awareness and gain some more traction for both Youtube's eyes and any potential victims.

egxid5,We're starting a country where Bitcoin is the official currency!,"Greetings,

In an age where technology is growing rapidly, we often forget our civil liberties. Since 9/11, the US federal government has implemented its authoritarian policies that‚Äôs gradually sweeping away our rights. We‚Äôve decided to start a country. The name will be decided at a later date.

**Government**

We‚Äôre going to form a provisional government. There will be multiple committees that are designated to do specific tasks like drafting a constitution. The constitution will be similar to the US constitution but a lot more modern and ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù (ahead of its time). Decisions are decided by the provisional government.

We will decide between a constitutional monarchy and constitutional republic.

**Territory**

The territory will be decided at a later date. Almost all the land on Earth has been claimed except for various pockets between Croatia and Serbia. There‚Äôs also the possibility of seasteading.

**Ideology**

‚ÄúLive and let live.‚Äù

We believe in minarchism, libertarianism, and the non-aggression principle (NAP). We will not tax anyone. Donations and contributions will be accepted. 

**Countries that inspired us**

* Rwanda
* Singapore
* United States
* Hong Kong
* United Kingdom

**How can you help?**

We‚Äôre looking for skilled people that are dedicated in starting a country. We are looking for the following people.

* Developers
* Programmers
* Business owners
* Politicians
* Lawyers
* Attorneys
* Designers
* Builders
* Planners
* Ambassadors
* Representatives
* Entrepreneurs
* Economists
* Journalists
* Engineers

**What we want to get done in 2020**

* Government
* Constitution
* Website
* Territory
* Roadmap
* Vexillology (flag)
* Heraldry (emblem)

**What now?**

eh2pvo,Will Bitcoin enter 2020 on a bullish wave?,"On May 20th 2020, the third Bitcoin halving will occur. 50% less Bitcoins will be generated every 10 minutes and this could change the value of Bitcoin. Forever.

This is known as a ‚ÄúHalving‚Äù and it has already occurred twice, each time boosting Bitcoins price by at least 10x. Despite increased awareness around Bitcoin, not a lot of people seem to be talking about this.

Today I will explain the Bitcoin Halving, how it could affect Bitcoins price and what to expect.

**Investing is a natural way of making money and making your dreams reality. Investing in cryptocurrency is still the most profitable way of making more in a short period of time especially when investing on big cryptocurrency investment platform like MULTICOINHODLER (Multicoinhodler Investment Platform) as MULTICOINHODLER is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now where you get at least 25% up to 100% return on investment after 10 days. MULTICOINHODLER supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that MULTICOINHODLER has a really nice UI and support. Try MULTICOINHODLER and make more money easily. Thank me later.**

**A deflationary currency:**

Bitcoin operates on a model of deflation. This means less Bitcoins will be made over time and eventually the supply will stop.

The supply will end when the last Bitcoin is mined in the year 2140. Bitcoins supply is limited to 21 million units by it‚Äôs built in algorithm, no more than that amount can ever exist.

This is different to fiat currencies which use an inflationary model. Inflation is a model where central banks can print extra units of currency at will.

Only a limited amount of Bitcoin exist, hence it can only be ‚Äúmined‚Äù and not created.

Bitcoins deflation makes it scarce and as we know, when something is scarce, it has more value.

**Block rewards:**

Bitcoins are generated whenever a ‚Äúblock‚Äù of transactions are solved by miners and added to the Bitcoin blockchain. This is an expensive process, requiring special hardware and loads of electricity.

In return for solving blocks, miners are rewarded with new bitcoins. These bitcoins are awarded by the Bitcoin algorithm and they‚Äôre known as the ‚Äúblock reward‚Äù.

The process occurs every 10 minutes, so in short, every 10 minutes new bitcoins are made.

The first miner to solve a block receives the block reward. Picture credit: Investopedia

Bitcoins first block reward was 50 BTC. This meant that every 10 minutes a bitcoin miner had 50 bitcoins sent to their wallet for confirming a transaction.

This was in bitcoins early days when it was less than a dollar and anybody with a laptop or computer could mine it. Nowadays miners don‚Äôt make as much as they did back then.

The current block reward is only 12.5 BTC, this is due to the block reward being cut in half (or halved), **twice**. This feature is programmed into Bitcoin and occurs every 4 years (210,000 blocks).

This will continue until the last bitcoin is mined in 2140.

Every 4 years, less and less Bitcoin will be mined. Picture credit: Investopedia

The next ‚Äúhalving‚Äù is set to happen 10 months from now, reducing the block reward to **6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.** The next halving could change Bitcoins price forever, like previous halvings have done.

Before we move on, lets quickly look at more factors that affect Bitcoins value and could amplify the halving‚Äôs effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eh2pvo/will_bitcoin_enter_2020_on_a_bullish_wave/,Marcobetty,1,2019-12-29 06:31:55,2,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eh2pvo/will_bitcoin_enter_2020_on_a_bullish_wave/,NaN

ehayra,Advice/hope for a (poor) noob regarding investing in Bitcoin (and other stocks),"Merry Christmas everyone. I hope you're well.

I'm writing this post out of desperation. Apologies in advance. 

I have a health issue which limits what I can do for work. I spend alot of time caring for my friend who was badly injured playing rugby. It's an honour to be able to help him, but I don't get paid. 

So, I have very little money and I'm just posting to get some advise on whether investing a small amount of my monthly income into Bitcoin. Obviously this is a Bcoin subreddit, so the answers maybe somewhat skewed. :)

I'm by no means living in povety (I.e: I own a laptop) but I am always worrying about running out of money by the end of the month. There are days that I have gone without food. I can handle not eating for a few days, strangely the hunger sensations go away after a couple of days. The hardest part is letting down the people closest to me. It's embarrassing for me to ask for help.

I have 0.02541 BTC (Roughly $150) saved up now. I'm contemplating selling, however I have suffered to earn this and I want to have hope for the future. I'm just not sure if I can do this anymore...

I hustle by working three jobs six days a week and I have barely any money in the bank. I'm absolutely burnt out. I need to change something or I'll continue living/existing in this black hole of poverty/scarcity. I can't see a way out, unfortunately. I hope that people in a few hundred years will never have to deal with this. 

Despite my poor finances I do try to keep upbeat. Life is hard enough, right?

How did you learn how to invest? Are you a 'day trader, or a 'hodl..er'?  Are there any books/talks you recommend for a novice? 

&amp;#x200B;

ehesy0,When is a bitcoin created and how do miners receive rewards for mining it?," 

I'm kind of new to this so if I make mistakes, I'm sorry.

1. If I'm not wrong the goal is to solve problems and try to find a random hash that has a lot of 0's at the beginning and if I'm not wrong a lot of hashes make up a bitcoin, so what defines that number? Also, is bitcoin made up of a lot of those hashes with 0's at the beginning?
2. Once a new bitcoin is created, how do the miners get credited? Do they get bitcoin to their bitcoin wallet, if so, how? if not, how? Also, what defines exactly how much they get and who gets it? Let's say there are 2 miners in total and the first one has already been mining for a few days while the other just starts and solves the problem in 10 minutes, who gets rewarded and how much?
3. If I randomly solve a hash on my computer and get the needed amount of 0's at the beginning and everything matches and it's the right one, what does that mean? what do i do? Did I manage to ""create"" a new bitcoin? If so, how much and how do i get rewarded and in this situation am i the only getting the reward or not? Also, how do i get the reward? How can I let the world know that I solved it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ehesy0/when_is_a_bitcoin_created_and_how_do_miners/,SilenceBRB,1,2019-12-30 01:15:25,15,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ehesy0/when_is_a_bitcoin_created_and_how_do_miners/,NaN

ehgl7z,Bitcoin ATMs are a good start. Improved wallet GUI and ease-of-use is even better. We need to continue to focus on usability and adoption.,"Bitcoin is reaching a point in its development where I think it is time we focus on ease-of-use features of Bitcoin for the average Joe.

It's not like it was back when we had to manually handle addresses and run our own nodes. People don't want to have to invest time or effort in order to benefit from something.

Most folks don't even care about how it works or why. **They only care about what Bitcoin can do for them.**

Bitcoin is safe. Bitcoin is easy. Bitcoin is for everyone.

Just recently I saw a conversation on Facebook where a lot of people were having issues with Square, Etsy, Paypal, etc for banning them because they were selling mature items, or items related to ""witchcraft"" or w/e.

These are exactly the people we need to target for adoption. People operating legal, but marginalized, operations in need of financial services.

We have to reach for the low-hanging fruit first, and the easiest sell is going to be to people who can't buy anything else worth having. Go for people who have trouble participating in the legitimate money system and we'll find our next adoptive group.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ehgl7z/bitcoin_atms_are_a_good_start_improved_wallet_gui/,gta3uzi,1,2019-12-30 03:45:29,7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ehgl7z/bitcoin_atms_are_a_good_start_improved_wallet_gui/,NaN

ehnn9n,Bitcoin ATM got me good,"I'm typically a Coinbase, localbitcoins, etcetera user but today my bank account is currently in the negative because my wife has cancer and our hospital bills are ridiculous. I only over spent 3 dollars on one transaction and 10 on another but the ""fees"" have me at -$144.87 despite me supposedly having explicitly asked not to have overdraft protection nor should they allow any transactions take place if my account couldn't cover it. So I decided to use a Bitcoin ATM today considering I'm crunched for time. The BTC atm only had a $2.50 transaction fee which doesn't seem bad but, it didn't show me what they were quoting BTC's current price at which was over $8,500 when it currently sits at $7,255.39 according to bitstamp. It only told me this AFTER my transaction. 

So to put it in a layman's perspective, I paid $92.00 USD and received $65.72 USD worth of BTC in my wallet. So for those of you who hate Coinbase fees, I hope this can give you some perspective on the drawbacks of ATMs and more importantly the fact that they're only adding to the reluctancy of mass market adoption.  I know I'm a dumbass, autist, (damn sure not a noob, just a dude down on his luck) and I could have done this any number of other ways, just please try to remember I'm human and I'm on your team, and I only meant this as a PSA (and a bit of venting my anger at those who use crypto as a tool of manipulation rather than a tool of fair market modernization). 

Much love from USA ‚ù§Ô∏è maybe r/theydidthemath can figure out where my break even price for BTC would be. Also this is not a hodl, this is a gift for my nephew in hopes he can learn the wonders of blockchain (a late Christmas gift, hence the reason I used the atm in the first place). Now my lovely redditor friends, you may commence with shredding me in any fashion you see fit. I'm sure I feel good and roasted when I come back to read this tonight. Happy coining.

ehwlsa,Pi Network -2nd Generation Bitcoin,"Dear friends.

Introducing completely free cryptocurrency mining.

PI Network's smartphone-only mining app is now completely free. Start mining now.
As of September 19, only 300,000 people have been mined worldwide. So the user does not recommend.
I don't need to promote it, and I think it's because I think it's free to mine for free.
That's why it's a coin that you have to preempt and collect. It is an app room that uses a mobile phone, uses little resources, and you can press the mining button only once every 24 hours.
And mining is possible even when the application is closed.
The most important thing is that there is no coin sale. Coin is generated only by mining (same as early bit deceased), so the risk of dumping is low.
Secure through fast entry. This can be an object.

&lt;Mining method&gt;
1. Search Pi Network on the Google Play Store or Apple Store and download the app or download it from the link below.
2. Pi Network download address: minepi.com/adwards
3. Open the installed app to join

4. Invitation code: gksqls6689

5. Start mining. Note that once mining starts, the session ends every 24 hours. After 24 hours, press the mining button again.
Please refer to the link below for more details!

So each time someone wants to send a a fund to someone else's address and enters the address, as a verifiation of the intended address, they can see the nickname in the receipient's name. It's just like the traditional banking. You need to ensure you send to the correct receipient. But this time, you can set as your own nickname, not your namw. 

For example, say I set my address's nickname as ""Love"" each time someone wants to send me some fund, they can see the verification nickname ""Love"" below the sending address.

ei7yjg,"How is implementing an OP_NOP, like Bitcoin did with HTLCs, considered a softfork?","It seems to be the consensus state that implementing a `OP_NOP` is a softfork. Just to get a written source for the sake of the discussion, this is written in many places, including Anreas Antonopoulos's book, Mastering Bitcoin, in the section ""Soft forks redefining NOP opcodes"".

I'm having trouble believing/understanding how this doesn't cause a hard-fork. Maybe someone can help?

Let's say, like bitcoin did before, we implemented HTLCs to replace `OP_NOP`, so we replaced it with `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`. Some nodes upgraded to that, and others didn't. Consequently, those who don't know about it (because they didn't upgrade), will just find this as a `OP_NOP`, while those who upgraded, will enforce HTLC rules.

As long as no one uses this OP, we have no problem. However...

Now say I submitted a P2SH transaction, where I allowed the receiver to spend that transaction only 1 year later. However, the receiver violates this, so he goes ahead and creates a transaction to spend the coins locked in that HTLC contract, even though I put that rule. In that case, miners + nodes who didn't upgrade, will accept the transaction, because `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` for them is a `OP_NOP`, but others who upgraded will reject it, because a year hasn't passed. 

Meaning: We have a fork that depends on time ordering. If the transaction gets propagated to the miners who accept it (because to them `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` is a `OP_NOP`), it'll go to a block, and those who upgraded will see that block as invalid, which will result in them blocking those miners/nodes for ""misbehaving"", which will result in a split in the network, because those who didn't upgrade will accept that block.

Where am I getting this wrong? How did Bitcoin manage to not hard-fork after implementing HTLCs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ei7yjg/how_is_implementing_an_op_nop_like_bitcoin_did/,TheQuantumPhysicist,1,2019-12-31 19:57:47,4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ei7yjg/how_is_implementing_an_op_nop_like_bitcoin_did/,NaN

eiiwht,"Project Working on Solving African remittance challenges through Bitcoin, payments issues &amp; inflationary tendencies for fiat currencies.","Hi everyone,

I'm a 25{M} from Africa, looking to be a teammate or co-founder for a start-up.  
The start-up has to be solving problems that also affect Africans to a greater extent so it can easily resonate with me.  
e.g A Cryptocurrency start-up to solve remittance challenges or inflation issues, something like that.

I have a bachelors degree in accounting(which I didn't use) since I changed my career to being a Growth hacker at a start-up I was with from 2016-2018

Right now I'm now working on being a full stack web developer(self-taught) and could ""perhaps"" fit a junior dev role.

I'm also good at bookkeeping and accountancy since it is something I studied in college, but my career isn't going that way so it's just a complementary skill.

With Growth hacking, I'm also good at designing experiments, improving SEO, User Acquisition and Retention.

I have experience working in start-ups so I'm quite familiar with concepts like failing fast, product-market fit, etc etc.

I don't wish to be paid, but anything to make my life easier would be welcome, e.g paying for internet costs etc etc.

PM so we can chat",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiiwht/project_working_on_solving_african_remittance/,MarkFischeer,1,2020-01-01 14:33:00,5,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiiwht/project_working_on_solving_african_remittance/,NaN

eij3b6,The past decade for bitcoin has been nothing short of an exciting ride but the next decade will be even more action-packed as we see higher acceptance &amp; adoption of this currency,"Bitcoin has been named as the best investment of the decade, rising by almost 9,000,000%. For any skeptics out there this is proof enough in this technology and its future.  

Despite its groundbreaking performance in the past decade, bitcoin adoption has a long way to go. The majority of merchants online still transact using fiat currency and are not aware of bitcoin or blockchain technology. While those who do tend to shy away from it thinking its too complicated and/or don't want to risk losing their money. 

It just takes 3 steps for anyone looking to sell online and accept bitcoin as payments. 

1) Create a Website: You are [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) or any other platform to create your website and promote your products/services.   

2) Create a Bitcoin wallet: [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [MyCelium](https://wallet.mycelium.com/) are some of the best wallets in the market. 

3) Integrate a Bitcoin Payment Gateway: [Blockonomics](http://blockonomics.co/), [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/), [Coingate](https://coingate.com/) are all great options and integrate easily with the website without hassle. 

All that's all it takes to start an online business and accept bitcoin as payments. It's a great time for bitcoin and everyone to belives in it cannot wait to see what the next decade brings, as the old saying goes, ""the best time to invest in bitcoin was 2009, the next best time is now!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eij3b6/the_past_decade_for_bitcoin_has_been_nothing/,primalfabric,1,2020-01-01 14:52:47,2,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eij3b6/the_past_decade_for_bitcoin_has_been_nothing/,NaN

 This article conveniently does not mention any blockchain technology (Maybe because it's such a hot fad, and doesn't want to make the ""cool"" rich kids look dumb).  
 [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)  
 One Bitcoin transaction is estimated to be 53,124 hours of YouTube videos.  
 Other applications of blockchain technology will essentially be much less efficient than YouTube.  
 Bitcoin and blockchain is the most destructive, and negligent technological movement that is occurring in the world today.

They really is no long term objective for most of you other than turning your Bitcoin into a large sum of fiat, so you can buy a lambo.   
 It's not the available and efficient Central systems that are the greediest, it's this social cult of wannabe rich crypto dystopian technos with 10 mining PC's running 24/7 at thier house wasting power from the grid, using natural resources.  
 Satoshi Nakamoto was smart he never intended for Bitcoin to be mainstream. It's was for discrete unlegislated transactions. Now it's about spreading lies and trying to get fiat rich from this crypto stock. 

I'm a computer scientist, I make open source applications. I am capable of remaking, info list applications (Facebook), or video bucket applications (YouTube). They really don't hold any other power other than they are the popular ones to use. The technology is not much different either way. I can encrypt anything with a strong 4096bit key with only a terminal. If I really had data that needed to be private I could make it happen. You can apply your own end to end encryption on ANY current platform you like. If that's something that you actually need or would spend 30 minutes learning how to do. People have a fear that thier data is being milked from them and used maliciously, even if they are unhesitatingly delightfully participants with these systems, with very little consciously malicious results over a long span of time. Ie. Thier fears are irrational and unfounded. Which is very similar to the fears, or delusions, of central banking systems. Are they perfect? Maybe no, but do they use 53k videos electrical use for single transactions? No.

I understand the math behind the blockchain, a solution to the double spending problem. That is all that is new. This solution incentives attacking the infrastructure, by brute Force computation. Any computation no matter how clean the energy is. Certain clean energies simply do not keep up with dirty ones. Solar, or wind, for instance would be very hard pressed to sustain the power consumption of 53k YouTube videos.

I hope we are at a shifting point of understanding climate change is a real problem, even if a bit late. We know we have to get in these clean energies. People's homes, and lives will have to transfer and be powered by these energies. However these energies currently cannot successfully support the grid, legitimate use or otherwise. People having crypto mining PC's running 24/7 does not help things, despite all of the smart ass bs you will hear on Reddit.   
 There is no guarantee that any of the energy used is clean, just with any other application of electricity. 

They will say that US central banking uses three times the electricity use of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has globally maybe around 6mil users the US population is 327mil. Let's just say that Bitcoin has 1/100th the amount of US users. If it became 100% used, that would make the energy usage 300x what the current US central banking system uses. 

Would clean energies even support that amount of use? It would be substantially more difficult transition to achieve. 

I would say this is what the entire blockchain movement is, it's not about more freedom, or actual beneficial systems for society. it's just about profit. You can see this phenomenon as this group, decentralized revolutionaries, that would normally utilize science, irrationally defend and slowly come to deny climate issues, when it conflicts with what they have investments in. They call the legitimate climate research FUD now... 

Now Reddit, I will let you commence your unscientific, economic jargon filled, bot like, social puppeterring, replies and down voting, just for me expressing my opinion and connecting truths and realities.

eiqr4m,"2020's - Goodbye Government, Hello Bitcoin","As humans scale to unprecedented population numbers, it is apparent that institutions and governments cannot cope with the current model that has been established. They are mostly failing in every metric.

Every time an institution or government creates new rules, they are exploited. The rules are then patched, and new exploits are found. This game of 'whack a mole' and 'cat and mouse' ultimately leads to less freedom and sovereignty for the individual.

Furthermore, people are coerced to fund these ridiculous shenanigans through taxes with the threat of violence if they do not comply with the rules or cough up the tax bill. 

This is not how a peaceful society operates. You cannot be threatening people with time in jail if they do not agree with your ill thought out policies and wish to opt-out.

The question now becomes, as the population grows, how do we create a functioning society that has strong incentives to behave in a certain way, without the need for a top-down authoritarian government with guns and cages if you do not wish to comply?

Bitcoin solves for this. 

Bitcoin is the only viable and effective solution we have to defend (and defund) government over reach and create a level playing field. Humans have long needed a global currency to cooperate and incentivize. That global currency is Bitcoin. 

Under a Bitcoin standard, a government would have to play by the rules of Bitcoin (just like everyone else) - meaning, they cannot print, double spend, steal or confiscate money at large scale to fund their absurd policies.

Their policies would be subject to the free market, an arena where the best ideas take center stage and compete for your money. If you've got a bad idea, it gets downvoted to oblivion, just like on Reddit. The government will have to spend their limited supply of Bitcoin to fund their policies, and if it's a bad policy, the government is held to account. There is a real opportunity cost to a government decision to forego Bitcoin. As a government, this opportunity cost does not currently exist for government issued and controlled supplies of money. This is the fundamental shift. We **all** report to the same Bitcoin profit and loss standard. Bitcoin has no super user admin privileges. No exceptions.

It is unlikely anything good will ever come out of government, and so government will eventually, over the long term, become irrelevant in transactions made over the Bitcoin network. Your political beliefs also become irrelevant. If you do not like a decision your government has made, don't worry, don't protest, don't lobby, don't bother with activism. Move on peacefully with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin makes government irrelevant not because people will starve them of taxes, but because government ideas cannot compete and respond to the very best in human innovation and ingenuity. They have never been able to. They always lag. The only way governments maintain their relevance is through theft of citizen's wealth with threats of violence if you do not comply. Boorish thuggery and bullying. That is their modus operandi. 

Holding bitcoin changes this.

There are two things that are required for a structural positive change to society.  
1. One single global currency - Bitcoin  
2. Education of Bitcoin for the masses

If you are trading your time (Monday to Friday, 9-5) or your goods and services for government issued currency, you are getting massively ripped off. Government issued currency is worthless. It becomes more so day by day, year by year. Government currency is the biggest shitcoin on the planet. 

Bitcoin is the only item on this planet that we can verify the total supply of at any point in time. This is huge. Recognize it. Acquire it by providing value to others. Use it to your advantage.

This is how we see a society move towards peace and prosperity.

eir3ad,"Bitcoin is not a ""store of value"" ... yet.",I think the debate on whether BTC is a store of value or a currency is the wrong perspective. Obviously the path to global money is a long and bumpy road but to argue over semantics is pointless. I believe that before something can be a store of value it has to go through a capture of value phase which is where we've been for the past ten years. Only after it has captured all the value it can will it be stable enough to be a currency and store of value.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eir3ad/bitcoin_is_not_a_store_of_value_yet/,Megaskreth,1,2020-01-02 01:26:08,7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eir3ad/bitcoin_is_not_a_store_of_value_yet/,NaN

eivo4d,The bitcoin baby steps,"The Bitcoin Baby Steps. 

Bitcoins 7 Baby Steps will show you how to buy bitcoin, build wealth and take control of your money for good.

(We recommend having a household budget and emergency fund before embarking on the bitcoin baby steps)

Baby step 1: Buy a small amount of bitcoin ($100 or so). 

Buying bitcoin is easy. Tons of apps are available. 

After you buy, just leave your bitcoin on the app. You will use this same app later if you wish to sell.

Great üëçüèº now you‚Äôve got your first bit of bitcoin!

Baby step 2: Buy more bitcoin.

Now that you‚Äôre comfortable buying, it‚Äôs time to start stacking sats. 

Sats are fractions of bitcoins. You want to stack as many as possible. 

But only stack what you‚Äôre comfortable not touching for 5+ years. 

Bitcoin is a long term investment.

Baby step 3: Purchase a hardware wallet.

Once you have $1,000 or more in bitcoin. It's time to get serious about your bitcoin security by taking your coins off the app.

Purchase a hardware wallet.

These devices store bitcoin offline (cold storage) so they are safe from hackers

Baby step 4: Take control of your sats (bitcoin).

Up until now you‚Äôve only had an iou, time to get your bitcoins off the app and send to your hardware wallet.

Send a small transaction ($10) in order to get comfortable making transactions.

Then send the rest of your sats.

Baby step 5: Learn more about bitcoin. 

As you wait for the price to rise, learn a little more about bitcoin.

There are so many high quality podcasts, books, articles etc... 

This isn‚Äôt like school.

Bitcoin content sparks your imagination and makes you excited.

Baby step 6: Multisig service.

Bitcoin can rise pretty fast. You may find yourself in a position where suddenly your $1,000 is now 100k. 

Multisig provides an extra level of security by splitting access to your bitcoin amongst multiple hardware wallets. 

We like @CasaHODL.

Baby step 7: Run a full node. 

Full node sounds scary and confusing. 

But a full node is just a copy of the bitcoin blockchain that you will use to receive and send transactions. 

You can do this by downloading the blockchain on your laptop, or you can buy a node pre-synced.

These baby steps are meant as a starting point and a touchstone.

You‚Äôll do steps 1 and 2 at the same time.

Steps 3 and 4 at the same time

and steps 5, 6 and 7 all at the same time.

Congratulations! üéâ 

You‚Äôre now in a position to get rich as bitcoin continues to dominate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eivo4d/the_bitcoin_baby_steps/,rogerverygay,1,2020-01-02 08:30:30,66,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eivo4d/the_bitcoin_baby_steps/,NaN

ej2qxx,I need your help r/bitcoin community please.,"Hi Guys, 

I am wondering if you can help me please, I am currently building a website where I can teach people about Bitcoin. This will be mainly for beginners; where new users can educate then self about bitcoin and the basic on how to open account, secure the account and mail using 2FA, buy, sell, choosing the right wallet, hardware wallet and more, etc. 

The website will be in Spanish as I find out that here in Spain people don‚Äôt know much about Bitcoin and many believe it is for criminal and terrorist. 

I don‚Äôt want to make it complicate for the users as the idea is to help then understand why it is important to embrace this technology in which is here to stay. 

I do have a lot of material already, but I didn‚Äôt realise when you are building something there are many little pieces that you learn on the road that you didn‚Äôt even remember. 

I would like your advice for example, I am planning in creating two tutorial on Trezor T and Ledger Nano S for the serious people who really want to invest and explain why it is import to use hardware wallet but what will be yours advice on daily wallet?. I do want to take only 1 possible 2. I do want to take into consideration users on Android and Apple. I been using for a long time BreadWallet and Exodus is great, but I want your opinion. 

The idea is to provide quality content, make it easy for the new people so they don‚Äôt go crazy download wallet and keep the 12 words etc, open accounts with exchanges, I do use Binance but I want your opinion in what work and what doesn‚Äôt work. 

I do have some idea, but I would like to hear your opinion in anything, video tutorial, top exchanges, best wallet, anything that can help me to make it easy to them. 

Any information will be welcome and really appreciate, r/bitcoin help me a lot to understand Bitcoin and now I would like to do the same but in my mother tongue. What I really want is give back to the community here what I learn here on reddit and other places.  

Please note that I do not want to be another website with news and daily info on BTC, I do want people to understand bitcoin and blockchain and this can be using video tutorial or anything else. 

Thank you so much for your time.

Let's use crypto the way it was meant to be used - as digital cash. Like cash, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have to be in circulation to gain value relative to the value of products and services purchased with them. The tools to do so are here for us to use.

ej5qfv,Should a business buy Bitcoin?," 

I operate a small IT firm. The other partner and I want to invest in Bitcoin, but other than lurking here for a while, we haven't made any major decisions. On one of my personal computers, I installed the Bitcoin Core, and have made a few small test purchases via Coinbase &amp; Coinbase Pro, and have transferred them to my wallet (in the bitcoin core application) as prep for the Jan 3 keys thing.

We have found ourselves with a bit of an opportunity. We have about $4-6K USD that is available in the business, and we want to purchase Bitcoin with this, as an investment for the business.

Is the next step for us purchasing a hardware wallet, setting that up, and then creating a Coinbase/Pro account for the business? Does the business need its own account? or can we purchase it through my personal account and then send it to the business' hardware wallet? If we have encrypted redundant backups of a system that is running the core/wallet, do we need a hardware wallet?

I am very open to suggestions, so please feel free to let me know where we can improve/help the community.

Spreading the investment over a period or doing it in one lump sum. Not your keys, not your bitcoins is something I have learned recently about the [Proof of Keys](https://www.proofofkeys.com/) on January 3 and I think it is really great community idea.

If you had $30,000 dollars for yourselves, would you invest it in Bitcoin right now, and why or why not? I would love to become a Bitcoin millionaire. 

Is it better to invest in Bitcoin mining insteads? I know I am late to the party but love the techonology so much and want to get in to it. 

To be honest I am very fortunate to live in a safe part of the world so I am not afraid to disclose how much I have online or how much I will plan to invest in Bitcoin. (But now I could see why people recommend this coming from other parts of the world where safety is not a given.)

ejh1vo,"So, why do YOU think Satoshi referred to Bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash despite modelling the entire system on gold?","I've always wondered about this aspect of Bitcoin. Personally, I've always just viewed it as digital gold, perhaps since that was the usecase for which I found it most attractive when I first discovered it.  Then, after learning more about it I've become more convinced that this is Bitcoin's primary value proposition - as a hedge against the legacy financial system that looks prime to collapse, again and any day now.  **I needed a better SoV immediately but not a better MoE.**  And Satoshi [did appear](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) to share the same concern given his/her/their message hidden within the genesis block. And if you look up the [definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cash) of cash, I'm sure most would agree that this does not describe Bitcoin.  ""Digital gold"" is a far better analogy. 

I guess that I could be called a hypocrite.  I have used bitcoin as a MoE to purchase several items over the last few years and also to top up my cellphone more recently using the Lightning Network.  However I have used Bitcoin as a SoV every single day since early 2013.

Honestly, if we never eventually managed to scale Bitcoin in a decentralized way and it remained as a form of digital gold indefinitely, I would reluctantly be able to accept that.  I'd simply store the vast majority of my wealth in Bitcoin and sell small amounts to fiat only when absolutely necessary. 

I don't believe that this is how this experiment will actually play out though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ejh1vo/so_why_do_you_think_satoshi_referred_to_bitcoin/,economicIllness,0,2020-01-03 15:40:43,103,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ejh1vo/so_why_do_you_think_satoshi_referred_to_bitcoin/,NaN

ejnqjt,What needs to happen for bitcoin to go mainstream,"
I‚Äôve read this sub on and off for years, and I have noticed that posts here generally fall into a few main categories: 

1. Banks and government are bad
2. Technical discussion
3. Memes
4. Bitcoin price charts

These are all great, but I haven‚Äôt seen much discussion from a slightly different point of view, on the question of what needs to happen for bitcoin to really make it mainstream. That‚Äôs what we all want, right? Mass adoption?

I am very pro-bitcoin, and I have been for years. I have some opinions that may differ from the general consensus of this community, but in the end I just want to see bitcoin succeed. And the way bitcoin is being talked about, here and in the real world, raises some concern in me. I am not a computer programmer - so no, I don‚Äôt understand every single detail about how bitcoin works and what is currently under development, but I understand enough. Here are some things I think need to happen for bitcoin to reach global adoption.

1. People cannot be responsible for securing their own money

There are people who understand how to obtain and use bitcoin, and then there are people who understand how to obtain, use, and adequately secure bitcoin. At this time, the only appropriate way to hold bitcoin of any significant value is in cold storage, and this you must learn and do yourself. We scoff at people who leave large amounts of bitcoin in online wallets or exchanges, yet this is how all other money is treated, at least in first world countries. 

In the U.S. you can adequately secure up to $250k per bank account by doing nothing more than literally just depositing the money. If bitcoin is to make it mainstream, the burden of security cannot be placed on the individual. In a future where bitcoin is the default currency, people are not going to know or care what cold storage is. It is going to be handled for them by an institution, such as a bank‚Ä¶

2. Banks need not to be the enemy

I get it. Most of the largest banks in the world are corrupt, criminal, and power hungry. But we still need them, and we always will. Bitcoin cannot replace banks. It can replace some of the services banks provide us, but it cannot replace banks in general. Banks are not an evil idea created by evil people. Outside of storing our money and processing transactions, they provide things like insurance, loans, and access to financial instruments such as stocks or bonds, just to name a few. Bitcoin is not going to magically do away with all of these things. I cringe every time I see a post titled ‚ÄúThis is why banks will fail!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe people will choose bitcoin over banks!‚Äù with a screenshot of a $4.95 account maintenance fee.

I believe bitcoin can and will provide the efficiencies and competition that will lead us away from these miscellaneous fees and long wait times for settlement, similar to how the Internet changed the way we trade stocks. At the end of the day, banks don‚Äôt charge fees because they have to. They charge fees because they can. They make most of their money by collecting interest on deposits. Bitcoin won‚Äôt change that. Money will still need to be loaned, and it will still come at a cost. Lenders will make money.

I think the most likely and most optimistic path forward is with banks actually embracing bitcoin, but in a behind-the-scenes kind of way. Most people will still want to have their money in a bank (secured by a third-party), and with bitcoin working in the background, we can all win. Of course, there will still be people who don‚Äôt want to use banks, and maybe that‚Äôs most of the people here. That is fine. Both things can exist. Some people prefer Ubuntu, but most are fine with Windows.

3. We need governments to support bitcoin (or at the very least leave it alone)

Can we pump the brakes just a little on the global money revolution? If and when bitcoin or another cryptocurrency really threatens some major world powers, it will be legislated out of existence. Ok, I guess technically crypto can‚Äôt be destroyed, but let‚Äôs not forget that governments do have the power to keep their people away from whatever they deem ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.

The flexibility of fiat money gives governments some levers to control their economies, and they are not just going to hand over that power. We need to play nice with governments. It may be for the best that bitcoin adoption grows slowly, giving legislators time to understand how it can benefit their country more than just decentralize power.

4. Cryptocurrency needs a new reputation

Unfortunately, 2017 left a bad taste in a lot of mouths. ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù has become synonymous with ‚Äúscam‚Äù or ‚Äúwild speculation‚Äù, and people associate bitcoin with crypto. Even amongst young people, the idea of cryptocurrency is just not that popular anymore. And I don‚Äôt think people are going to warm up to the idea until bitcoin is truly ready for mainstream. For mass adoption we need a catalyst, a tipping point, but I don‚Äôt think the technology is ready for that yet.

First, we need a network that can scale. Then we need legacy companies to step up and help us use it. Then we need governments to stay out of our way. 

I know what you are thinking. The whole point of bitcoin is that it is trustless and without intermediaries. But in reality, no currency (or store of value, or transactional system) will reach worldwide adoption by itself. Bitcoin can remain decentralized, while third-parties stay involved in the process (yes, even banks). I just can‚Äôt see a future where bitcoin is the one and only piece of the monetary puzzle. I see bitcoin as more of a foundation upon which the financial world will eventually reorganize itself, using more or less the same pieces. Hopefully, with less corruption and disparity this time, and more prosperity for everyone.

ejri6r,Issue upgrading my bitcoin node,"Hello,

I'm trying to update my current node (v0.18.1.0). I'm running my node on Mac using an external HD.

Everything is on my HD except for the bitcoin.conf file and the Bitcoin Core icon in my Applications folder.

I was able to launch my node using the icon on my Application folder (bitcoin-qt) or using the command line (bitcoind)

Since I downloaded the new version (v0.19.0.1), I have the following issue:

When I launch my node using the icon on my Application folder (bitcoin-qt) everything is fine and the new version is running (using the data in my external HD), but when launch the node using the command line (bitcoind), it still launch the old version.

Is there a separate update from bitcoind? I've done some research online but I didn't find anything helpful.

Thank You!!!

ejvhri,How Bitcoin Looked 11 Years Ago,"I rebuilt the earliest version of Bitcoin software I could find (with some bugfixes) and here is what I found.

# Bitcoin Logo History

The very first logo made by Satoshi contained two characters: B and C and looked this way:

[The original Satoshi logo](https://preview.redd.it/knoqrcl19s841.jpg?width=51&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77914e7a2d236445f62870dbcbec9d6ac0ea9bb)

Possibly there is one more proof of that which largely went unnoticed. Look at the ""About Bitcoin"" screenshot below to notice B(C). This might just be a (nice) glitch in the build process.

[The About Bitcoin window depicting \\""B\(C\)\\""](https://preview.redd.it/qkz0frzs8s841.jpg?width=507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615ddd60d882b96b8720bb76198d15294282b185)

Later in February 2010 Satoshi decided to move to a one character version of a logo which everyone recognizes by now:

[The second version of a logo by Satoshi, went incredibly popular](https://preview.redd.it/1p26gnv39s841.png?width=48&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d72ca0368526f7d0b9ea7e1e001e8ba747146f1)

# Hidden features

When I was building the original Bitcoin wallet software I noticed there are some unused windows present in the resources and also some code is left unused too. They are most obvious to find in wxWidgets form editor. For example, here is a window for a product editor in some kind of a an online marketplace:

[Edit Product form window](https://preview.redd.it/q7jx4fk59s841.jpg?width=661&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18cca0005b8dbfb7676e02530074995da1fada48)

That one is known. But I'm pretty sure you never heard of a poker being in the early version of Bitcoin!

[Satoshi actually added some preliminary support for playing poker in Bitcoin!](https://preview.redd.it/082ygvk69s841.jpg?width=809&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=832ef6f1d3d66ce370f7e5fbdeca921da23293ab)

# Sending Bitcoins to IP-address

The preferred way to send bitcoins back then was to specify IP address of a receiving Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore, you could even attach a text message for your transaction! (it would not be stored in the blockchain though). So traditional 1... Bitcoin address was required only if the recipient was not online.

ejzxrs,Bitcoin is probably a Veblen good,"Veblen goods are goods for which the quantity demanded -increases- as the price increases.

A common argument I see against stock to flow is that it doesn't factor in demand, but I believe that because Bitcoin is money there is always demand for money and in fact, a greater demand as the price increases (contrary to normal demand curves where demand decreases as price increases). What is truly mind-blowing about this is that if the cointegration of the stock to flow model holds, then the following is also true:

All other factors that we think influence price are really just noise - all China FUD, exchange hacks, Bitcoin sentiment and google search trends, noobs mistakenly buying BCash and shitcoins, people not realising they can buy fractions of Bitcoin etc.

I repeat - EVERYTHING else is noise, only the scarcity of Bitcoin matters in terms of its price and value.

ek0v6v,WW3 looming bitcoin could shoot to 100k in a few weeks.,"There is no more safe haven in FIAT of any of the involved nations.So we got china , russia already making provocative statements against US.Stocks are already in bubble territory and p/e ratios will get even more out of wack so Stocks are very risky.Everything becomes super risky because the entire system's weaknesses comes to light.

Safe Assets will be a place that doesn't rely on trust and that is bitcoin. Time to get one of those satellites if your in the danger zone and thank god for redundancy. I saw on twitter a few days ago BTC is $29,000 in Iran already.

Bottom line you will have a minimum of $5T and maximum $15T looking for cover. Let's pray ww3 is avoided and we can transition slowly but the fact remains 'flight to safety' is even more important than store of value and has not been priced in at all do to the immaturity of our market.

ek1ibj,explain how limited Supply isn't a drawback 4 Bitcoin,"Listen I've read articles and did quite a bit of research on this. I know that Bitcoins can be split into quite a few decimals and that's not really the issue... Hear me out 

1. first of all the miners won't be as interested in mining Bitcoin once that supply has almost been met or the difficulty of the final bit coins are too high compared to the cost of electricity Etc. Mining will have to be done by people on a basis that they will be compensated by the fees paid.

2. Ultimately Bitcoin will fail as the demand for money is constantly increasing as economic activity increases. Especially if Bitcoin where to go mainstream the demand for it would keep going up and up. And I don't mean for the next 5 or 10 years but for the next 50 or 70 years...

3. 3rd and the one I'm most curious to hear people's opinions about dot-dot-dot losing Bitcoins. There is an unknown number of Bitcoins now which are lost. For example if somebody had the private keys on a hard drive or paper and lost Them. I'm not sure what the current estimates of lost Bitcoins are right now but I know there are significant amount of Bitcoin that are lost and can no longer be circulated if you assume that by human error people will lose private keys as it's an event that no doubt happens quite regularly, imagine how this will look like throughout the years... In 5 or 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years... not only is the supply of Bitcoin finite but also the Bitcoin in circulation will gradually decrease as people lose their private keys buy one way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ek1ibj/explain_how_limited_supply_isnt_a_drawback_4/,SupineTwist,0,2020-01-04 19:55:19,15,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ek1ibj/explain_how_limited_supply_isnt_a_drawback_4/,NaN

This benefits those that get it first (much like those that grabbed most of the land yonks ago). OTOH, shell money has no limit yet it worked very well and for years. The key to that, I think, was in the cost of production. You'd only make new shell money if your day to day job paid less. That gives the shell money model the advantage that more can be produced if too many coins are lost due too much hodling or hodlers snuffing it and taking it (their keys) with them!

Do not care for bitcoin price would be another tip, bitcoin has a 4 year cycle ( hence the halving study tip ) and we humans tend to be immediatists and even a 1 year wait is a lot for us, but think about this, if you just got in here, buy and wait at least 4 years to sell and I can guarantee you that these 4 years are going to be the best lesson you¬¥ll ever had.

Try to understand that the monetary system is old AF, and think about the phone you had 11 years ago ( whn bitcoin started ) and now think about how old the financial system is... this will be the path to really understand what is going on in here.

We are nothing against governments that control money, and we will never win that battle. Bitcoin is a way. Just think about it, that is all we ask for.

Thank you Satoshi, you¬¥re the man.

ek6n7g,Another example why the masses still have a long way to trusting Bitcoin and any Cryptocurrency,"The True Brits is one of my favorite ever youtubers. He his a brilliant host and advocate of Football/soccer games which his channel based predominantly on the Pro Evolution Soccer series, along with FIFA sometimes and provides the highest level of commentary you will hear anywhere on any youtubers channel in the English language.

Sadly, some scammers hacked his account and proceed to do this.

Hack his channel then broadcast this crap!

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/skFh6K4.png](https://i.imgur.com/skFh6K4.png))

The usual hit and run donation scam, asking anyone to click on their scammy link to send them bitcoin to receive some back which of course they never do.

Once this practice is finally apprehended and tackled with real consequences then maybe the masses will be more trusting to this technology!

This is also a warning to anyone who see this please do not and never ever send money to channels like this asking you to send them bitcoin! Never ever do that!

See now all of his followers will now look upon bitcoin as some scammy thing used by criminals again, not the financial revolution its meant to be. We need to be vigilant to call these people out and this is why this space will go anywhere until we have some framework to tackle these people. This is a typical reason why this community will have such a hard time convincing your friends and family to adopt bitcoin. 

For damage control I may release some stuff to show Bitcoin itself is completely neutral and is a great thing made to empower the people to take control of their finances.

These psychos don't give a shit about anything, you can tell they piss away all the money they make on nonsense hence why they make it in the scummy way they do. Their lives have no meaning hence why they spoil other peoples things.

Anyway, i'm so annoyed, I will release bitcoin kits to tell these guys to fuck off out of TTB's channel but also to show Bitcoin really is not all bad, the scammers like this who give bitcoin such a bad name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ek6n7g/another_example_why_the_masses_still_have_a_long/,klashman69,2,2020-01-05 02:29:00,9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ek6n7g/another_example_why_the_masses_still_have_a_long/,NaN

ekh83z,Why Bitcoin POW will Always be better than Altcoin Consensus mechanism,"Each Bitcoin created by POW immediately has a value attached with it.  Whoever spent the cost of electricity and mining equipment knows the coin is either worth that much at minimum.  Even if they think the price would go down in the future, the miners already know the price they paid for it.  That estimate is in their heads.  As the price goes up miners will sell at a profit in Fiat.  If the price goes down miners will believe it is undervalued and will hold because they know the minimum that they paid for the coin.

With POS there is no immediate price tag for the coins.  Someone sold the coins to you at a price based on speculation and not natural resources(POWER) and technology(mining equipment).  Or the POS coins were air dropped or Pre-mined in which case they still start with a value based purely on speculation.

With other configurations of consensus the Network has either: 

1 Based value on something arbitrary or unpredictable

&amp;#x200B;

2 Not yet been Decentralized

&amp;#x200B;

3 Based on Voting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Voting based consensus mechanisms are terrible. When Value is voted on it becomes politicians who determine money supply.  History shows politicians vote to increase the supply out of necessity.  Bitcoins entire point was opposite this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ekh83z/why_bitcoin_pow_will_always_be_better_than/,Silver4R4449,1,2020-01-05 18:54:48,17,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ekh83z/why_bitcoin_pow_will_always_be_better_than/,NaN

eks8c9,Bitcoin Groupthink,"So, I am just learning Social Psychology in University and it is so fascinating to see how group dynamics in Bitcoin context happens.

&amp;nbsp;

Group-think is an effect whereby people via two ways fall into dysfunctional decision-making outcomes. The reason is because we people want to belong in a group, and in this case, no matter the cost. Insert your 'bitcoin maximalist' here. 

As a result, when the 'project is promising', the result is **collective over-optimism**. Insert your bullish memes and charts. To the moon!

&amp;nbsp;

The other way happens when the 'project is risky'. The result is **collective avoidance**, which basically means people ignore other people's opinions and critique. Sounds familiar?  

Funny how *both* of these outcomes are applicable to Bitcoin sphere.

&amp;nbsp;

What do I think?

Let's just say that I have a long-term outlook, knowing that Bitcoin is more than what you can see from scratch. It is not just memes, hodling, and bubbles.

eli6a2,"Not to circle jerk, but holy fuck I can't wait till the banks get replaced with Bitcoin.","&lt;rant&gt;

People complain about the fees, and time to transfer money via Bitcoin.

I've spent two weeks trying to transfer a measly $4000 between two banks. A transfer that managed to fail, and that now I need to investigate during banking hours.

A transfer that should have taken a week, but has taken two because banks don't operate on holidays and for some reason, and Electronic Funds Transfer also stops working when the banks are closed, just to end up failing.


The whole while, I'm thinking to myself that for a few dollars, and 30 minutes, I could have transferred literally millions of bitcoin and been done.


WHY IS THE BANKING SYSTME LIKE THIS!?

eljuom,My Layman's way to visualize the way Bitcoin operates.,"*\*\*Earlier, I posted this as a reply to another topic but feel it deserves a post of it's own\*\** 

&amp;#x200B;

 In order to truly grok how BTC works, it might help to **visualize the BTC blockchain as a ""very special"" vault with 21 million ""very special"" bars in it. This Vault is sealed from the outside and it's contents unchangeable for all time**. The walls of this vault are as transaprent as glass... yet, impenetrable. While anyone can see in there, only a Private key has the ability to speak to this network. And it may only speak about the Satoshis labeled as the ones belonging to that key.

In it's early days after creation, this vault had very few people listed as owning anything within it. **Nakamoto himself had mined (by mining, he had done work for the network and in return that network put his name on some of those special bars that it forever holds).** Take a second and picture the network using a Sharpie marker and writing ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" directly on the side of some of those ""special bars"". To test his new Vault's abilities, Nakamoto then sent the network a command (a command only made valid by his private key's signature on that command) to re-label a few of those bars to a new owner: thus the network drew a line though ""Nakamoto"" and wrote underneath it a new owner: ""Hal Finney"".

Soon, other people jumped onboard. Many of these new people came and gave that network thier computer power to help process the ""work"" for the network... as a reward, the Network wrote their names on (awarded them control over) some more of the Vault's 21 million units. ""Un-Mined Satoshis"" already exist. They live already in that special vault. But they have never yet had anyones name written on them and they are simply refered to as ""un-mined"".

In time, many saw true value in this permissionless, anonymous, and unconfiscatable unit/method of accounting. Somewhere along the line, and as this perceived value grew, someone somewhere offered someone else another unit of exchange (cash) for thier Bitcoins. Thus for the first time Bitcoin was suddenly valued *AGAINST* what most of us know as money. It wasn't long before this virtual currency had enough value that someone was willing to trade for REAL goods. Goods such a few pizzas...

\*\*\*\* **Final mindblow: the BTC network doesnt deal in ""Bitcoins""** ... It sees and operates in Satoshis as the TRUE unit of measure. Go back and look real closely at that special bar again. It's actualy 100 million little mini bars (satoshis) stacked together.... each with their own little tiny name tag telling the network who has the control over them.

Those that constantly say **""Stack Sats and Chill""** get this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eljuom/my_laymans_way_to_visualize_the_way_bitcoin/,gld6000,1,2020-01-07 23:34:08,1,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eljuom/my_laymans_way_to_visualize_the_way_bitcoin/,NaN

I've seen a lot of interest from people in this group to access historical Bitcoin candlestick data. To help everyone out, we've made all of our candlestick data public. That means you can access everything we have here:

[https://developers.shrimpy.io/docs/#get-candles](https://developers.shrimpy.io/docs/#get-candles)

You don't need to sign up for an account or anything. The data is completely public for use. Just call the endpoint in your browser to test like this:

Try a few different pairs, exchanges, and candlestick sizes - I think you will find it pretty exciting! You can of course plot this data as well. We have some examples of how to plot candlestick data [**here**](https://blog.shrimpy.io/blog/a-python-script-for-cryptocurrency-price-charts?rq=candlestick). 

I'm happy to answer any questions if you have some. Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

Do you always wear your **favourite t-shirt** when you trade **Bitcoin**? 

Can a **black cat** destroy your trading day? 

What about trading on **Friday the 13th**? 

Trading is a very, very emotional game. Add to this the constant search for trading patterns and it is not that hard to ‚Äú*believe*‚Äù that wearing that purple t-shirt always brings you profit :)  

I bet many of you think twice before trading on Friday the 13th. 

But is it really true? Will you lose if you trade **Bitcoin** on those Fridays? Let's check this out.   

Since 2015 there were 10 days which are the 13th day of the month and Friday at the same time. So let's imagine we bought **Bitcoin** on the opening of these days and holding till the close of the day.   

Six of those days were up days meaning we would have made a profit. The largest percentage profit was **6.1%** on the 13th of February 2015. The largest profit in dollar terms was **$196.8** on 13th of October 2017. Not bad for an unlucky day! 

Four of those days were down days and would have resulted in losing trades. The biggest loss in percentage terms was **-4.17%** on 13th of March 2015. The trade on 13th of September 2019 resulted in **-76 USD**, which was the biggest loss in dollar terms.   	

In the end, if we were to buy 1 **Bitcoin** on the opening of every Friday the 13th and closing on its close we would have made **$153 profit**. 

It is not that much of a profit but enough to show that there is nothing to be afraid of when trading on Friday the 13th.    
That is good to know because 2020 is bringing us more of those scary Friday's. One in March and one in November. So put on your favourite t-shirt and be prepared.

But what about the **Bitcoin trading rituals**? Can they help you be a better Bitcoin trader?

elub3f,How to prove you are a time traveler using the bitcoin blockchain,"It turns out there are more applications of bitcoin than simply revolutionizing every economic system ever conceived. It is also possible to prove you traveled through time with the help of the hashing mechanism behind our favorite blockchain. 

As a thought experiment, consider the following calculation. 

Assume every gigahash per second for the bitcoin PoW mechanism requires [1 Watt](https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-power-does-the-bitcoin-network-use-391280). The bitcoin network currently operates at 121*10^9 GH/s, thus using 121* 10^9 Watts per second.

For comparison, the sun is producing 3.846* 10^26 Watts per second.

This means the sun is producing 3.2*10^15 times more energy per second than the Bitcoin blockchain is currently using. 

Currently, blocks start with 19 zeros. With 3.2*10^15 times more energy, you could produce an additional 13 zeroes for a total of 32 leading zeroes per block. This is assuming that each additional zero requires 16 times more work.

Now, if you as a civilization are able to use the energy of your host star, that makes you a type II civilization on the Kardashev scale.

My challenge to the universe and its type II civilization time travelers is simple. Produce an empty block with around 32 leading zeros in the coming year and we‚Äôll take notice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/elub3f/how_to_prove_you_are_a_time_traveler_using_the/,pastpresentposterity,1,2020-01-08 15:39:20,16,/r/Bitcoin/comments/elub3f/how_to_prove_you_are_a_time_traveler_using_the/,NaN

My first thought was to integrate a Twitter feed of the respective wallet being mentioned but apparently that is not trivial with their [embed assistant](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/embed-twitter-feed).

I need something generic that works for almost all wallets (almost all wallets have some wallet or company twitter handle), that is out of my control (r/walletscrutiny is under my control and so would be a discussion board that I could add to the project itself) and where whoever is in control can't be easily bullied into removing bad reviews. Ideally it would also be something that already has content.

I will probably go with adding a search button but it's probably not neutral to pick search terms for every wallet and not efficient to use generic terms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/em0qzp/where_can_i_find_uncensored_discussions_of/,giszmo,1,2020-01-08 23:19:21,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/em0qzp/where_can_i_find_uncensored_discussions_of/,NaN

em6ujx,Will Bitcoin end up like Esperanto?,"When we take a look at Esperanto one can see a few parallels. 

It was not taken seriously from the beginning and Volapuk was still preferred.

Later it reached quite an interesting following.

Then there was a boom and Esperanto started to gain relatively big following, magazines and organizations pop up.

Then France said no in voting to get Esperanto as an official language in the League of Nations.

Then Esperanto was kind of living and kind of not.

Then there was the end of Soviet Union and Internet and English definitely ended.

Then the ""fina venko"" was finally dead - although it kind of still lives in the underground and Esperanto is a well known term and language with some impacts on the language like ""Mirinda"".

Do you see some parallels with Esperanto and Bitcoin. And Zamenhof (it's creator) and Satoshi who both wanted a better, more equal world, but were destroyed by bigger players France and later English, and banks, corporations (ApplePay, Libra) and states in the end?

I personally see a ton of parallels and it could even be an interesting article or even a book.

emmz46,I was fucking around with Bitcoin on Desmos,"So I put in the values of bitcoin at the first day of every month since the 15th month Bitcoin launched. Numbers on x axis are months and numbers on y axis is USD. The purple line is the line of best fit using x\^3.  As you can see below I have my equation in there.  I understand my graph isn't super accurate, but it gets more accurate after the mid thirties. It predicts the trend of bitcoin very well throughout. Just the actual predicted money value is messed up in the beginning . This graph suggests that there is about to be a upswing! This is my first time doing one of these. I understand this isn't super complex stuff or anything. Do I have any massive errors besides predicted money value before mid thirties? Red is my prediction line and green is connecting all data points. The very last point is Bitcoins price when I ended up doing the graph. The yellow dotted line is the rounded up month of the peak illustrating that my graph peaks at the same times as Bitcoin. Thanks!

emqxig,Best PC hardware for Bitcoin Core Syncing?,"Hi guys,

I would like to get your expertise in what you think is the best computer hardware parts for syncing the blockchain on Bitcoin core really fast, ranked from most important to least.

Is it:

CPU
Hard drive
RAM

- For cpu I assume more cores makes it sync faster? Will there be large speed difference for 4core vs 6 vs 8?

- Would there be a big speed difference in a nvme PCIe gen 3 vs gen 4 SSD? (Gen 3 is max 3500 MBps read/write where gen 4 can be max 5000 read/write). Or what about just a normal sata SSD?

- If I loaded the PC with like 64GB of DDR4 ram and set Bitcoin core config to have almost all of that available to it, would that significantly increase sync speed?

I have a really old PC for syncing right now and looking to upgrade it. But I'm trying to figure out what will/won't help sync speed times and to see how much to budget. I have decent internet download speed, I think it's 650mbps.

Let me know if you have any questions.

emram9,How we automated the process of creating a Bitcoin crypto portfolio with a maximum Sharpe ratio?,"One of the questions we ask ourselves is how crypto investors structure their portfolio and what methods can be used to increase the performance of the crypto portfolio. **Our test optimal portfolio returned us ‚Äî 69.66% in 2019.** Let‚Äôs see what methods can be used to achieve the best result.

# What is an optimal crypto portfolio?

This portfolio is balanced in terms of risk and return with a maximum Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is an indicator of the effectiveness of the investment portfolio, the higher it is, the more the portfolio will bring a return on investment.

We at [Holderlab.io](https://holderlab.io/) automated the process of structuring the portfolio and optimizing it using the efficient frontier method, for which the author of the method, Harry Markowitz, received the Nobel Prize. This method is widely used by portfolio managers, hedge funds.

However, we use a not quite classical method. We analyze from 5,000 portfolios, the purpose of which is to find the minimum volatile portfolio, the most volatile portfolio and one the most optimal one.

# How do crypto investors structure their crypto portfolio?

Often weights are distributed proportionally.

**Example A:** Bitcoin ‚Äî 20%, Ethereum‚Äî 20%, XRP‚Äî20%, Bitcoin Cash‚Äî 20%, USDC ‚Äî 20%

Or preferring top cryptocurrency.

**Example B:** Bitcoin ‚Äî 40%, Ethereum‚Äî 20%, XRP ‚Äî 20%, Bitcoin Cash ‚Äî 10%, USDC ‚Äî 10%

We will test that two crypto portfolio using the backtest module in Holderlab and look at the results.

Testing parameters: **Start date: 01/01/2019; End date: 31/12/2019; threshold rebalance: 3%**

Results of example A with proportional portfolio:

&amp;#x200B;

[Proportional Crypto Portfolio \(A\)](https://preview.redd.it/feboe5rjiy941.jpg?width=1089&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f693201690043bdffde17dbfb945b8bd17fade4a)

**Results: P&amp;L ‚Äî 11.82%, Max. drawdown ‚Äî 37.26%**

## Results of example B with proportional portfolio:

&amp;#x200B;

[Performance chart of example B](https://preview.redd.it/czquaamtiy941.jpg?width=1092&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0805cdfba48ca41ab7bf77d8485f59acef4631d9)

**Results: P&amp;L ‚Äî 26.03%, Max. drawdown ‚Äî 36.38%**

Now we will optimize our portfolio using the effecient frontier. Holderlab analyzes over 5,000 portfolio variation to find the best portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. We carry out the analysis using the optimization tool on the [Holderlab.io](https://holderlab.io/)

&amp;#x200B;

[Efficient Frontier](https://preview.redd.it/cno2fyo9jy941.jpg?width=1387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cff2c6f746f9196a66cdecc0ee4ec67f8963534)

Portfolio distribution weights is:

&amp;#x200B;

[Optimal Crypto Asset Allocation](https://preview.redd.it/2wwyl10hjy941.jpg?width=1118&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f31e08d2ebd83e71b43c2393875288fc64032bb)

After optimization, our allocation became as follows: Bitcoin ‚Äî 69.8%, Ethereum ‚Äî 1.51%, **XRP ‚Äî 0.34%**, Bitcoin Cash ‚Äî 26.78%, USDC ‚Äî 1.57%

The allocation of XRP turned out to be extremely small and we will not consider it further, we will allocate XRP proportionally to the entire portfolio. Also, when rebalancing, small allocations will cause an error.

Let‚Äôs look at the test results.

&amp;#x200B;

[Optimal Crypto Portfolio Return](https://preview.redd.it/chprnymljy941.jpg?width=1007&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb4acc9fb0e65bc62a32f67c50691cf0cead6aa)

Results: P&amp;L ‚Äî 69.66%, Max. drawdown ‚Äî 35.2%

As we see the result of the crypto portfolio increased by 57.84% and the drawdown decreased by 2.06% not so much, but as we see our test portfolio was weakly diversified.

Bitcoin brought us the greatest return in 2019.

ems67f,"Yet another take on ""bitcoin and crypto are scams""","Hi All,

I know, hundreds of posts like these have probably been written throughout crypto‚Äôs relatively short history: crypto is a fraud, a ponzi, etc.

I wasn't sure where to put this, but I ‚Äòd very much like to hear your opinions on my particular take on this matter. So Here it goes: 

Seeing how much the physical metals market has been and continues to be manipulated, the trillions of dollars conjured up by the fed the prop up the stock market, ‚Ä¶ and really, how the story of modern man has always been one characterised by an elite fleecing the proles at every step; doing everything they can to make sure they never get the chance to really build and safeguard capital for the long term, I wonder how the cryptomarket fits into to this story. 

At least to me, this notion that for the most part, the enormous run-up in prices until the last bubble popped, has been purely speculative, makes much sense to me. A bubble driven by the idea that there‚Äôs always a sucker somwhere down the line willing to buy a stash of coins preferably at much higher prices. I mean, was it really a question of user cases? Perhaps for BTC to some extent yes, with a few revolutionary minds thinking it will provide them a way of definitively escaping fiat, and the games central banks play. For the great majority however, it was and continues to be about hoping history repeats itself, in short, about an easy way to riches, about greed. 

Thinking of this little history, this reality I outlined here. It would make perfect sense for the FED to print a few billion dollars at no cost, and then use it to drive up the market by proxy, merely creating one more elaborate scheme to fleece the people. The few who got in early and took profits and got rich, well, I guess it is not that troublesome a thought to TPTB.

Anyway, I wonder where the money is going to come from this time around? Institutional investors? And with the world‚Äôs dwindling middle-class (please see Chris Hamilton‚Äôs blog - [https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration\_39.html](https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration_39.html)) subjected to ever more forms of financial repression, are there really that much people left willing to prop up this highly uncertain and volatile market with their hard earned cash? Then there are the one‚Äôs I hear of that bought in the green, near the top of some movement, only to get burned badly, shortly after. Do you think people like these - often still possesing enough capital to frivolously spend, will instead buy in when there‚Äôs fear in the market, when they should? No, I don‚Äôt think so. They got burned and are staying away for good. 

Ofc, it might turn out to be the classic Wall Street chart. Hopefully we‚Äôll see the disbelief phase soon, as a new bull market emerges. But I have my doubts. The manipulators of this market can keep this thing going for a long time, each time just draining away funds, giving hope and a bit of relief from time to time.

One of the things that still keeps me in, is the knowledge that as easy as it is for ‚Äúthem‚Äù to drain this market, they can pump it up in the same manner. Again, is it that implausible for certain parties buying and selling crypto with fiat provided by the FED? The money for these investors is free basically, just like it was for Blackrock or Blackstone buying tens of thousands of homes with FED money [https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/) Am I wrong in thinking that if they want to, they can just keep on pounding this market into oblivion? They don‚Äôt need it to succeed or even have a return, they need to see it fail, and for the time being, have it draw in as much capital and savings as possible, until a nice reset, with a date of their choosing. Until then everyone keeps on buying the ‚Äúdips‚Äù, and the suckers do it in reverse ofc.

They say the market is there to inflict as much pain as possible. Likewise I can also see a scenario play out, where they do pump it up again, but slowly at first, so those of a cautious nature, decide to just play it safe, and be content with a little profit, only for TPTB to then pump it up to new ATH‚Äôs. The story repeats itself, people buy in higher, their stash now smaller, and then the market turns again. But yeah, this sort of contradicts my story perhaps. But then what, after that? Rinse and repear, one boom and bust, parabolic rally after the other? 

Perhaps, if the FED just keeps on printing and the stock market continues hitting ATH‚Äôs, then maybe some of this money will splash into the cryptomarket, but then there‚Äôs the political aspect to this money printing, hence we get articles like [https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn)

As far as XRP is concerned, because it is sometimes mentioned in regards to a coming liquidity crisis, and how XRP would be used to solve that. I just cannot see how any of the major banks will pay the small timers out there, holding Xk of XRP, a few or even tens of dollars or whatever per XRP. It would be such a break of this age old dynamic. This time the powerful somehow bowing to the weak. For once being in a position of subservience, of dependency. With J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs paying the little guy to please part with his XRP so they can use it. I just cannot see this scenario play out. 

This crypto history somehow also reminds me of the classic private business MO: governments and the taxpayer providing the funds for projects (universities, laboratories) which then down the road, get bought up by private business. So the cost of development is on our dime, and the rewards, the profits are syphoned off to a nice tax haven. 

Crypto feels a bit like that to me. Suckers funding it all, only for the big players to come afterwards (with a mature product) and buy it out or use the developed tech and stamp their name on it. If it succeeds and end up into something useful, great, if it turns out to be a dead-end, but somehow good lessons were learned, to improve on a next iteration, all is good. Isn‚Äôt this how things work often.

As Michael Parenti once wrote: 

&gt;*""They are not going to leave any little bit for you. There‚Äôs only one thing that the ruling circles throughout history have ever wanted-all the wealth, the treasures, and the profitable returns; all the choice lands and forests and game and herds and harvests and mineral deposits and precious metals of the earth; all the productive facilities and gainful inventiveness and technologies; all the control positions of the state and other major institutions; all public supports and subsidies, privileges and immunities; all the protections of the law and none of its constraints; all of the services and comforts and luxuries and advantages of civil society with none of the taxes and none of the costs. Every ruling class in history has wanted only this-all the rewards and none of the burdens.""*

I know, reality is often far more complex and ambiguous, nor is it captured in lineair, deterministic thinking, of which I‚Äôm guilty here perhaps. 

Some of you may be familiar with the writing of a certain J.C. Collins and his blog philosophyofmetrics. First it was the introduction/widespread adoption of the SDR that would fundamentally change the economy, then Collins started writing about crypto‚Äôs, and XRP in particular, replacing the SDR. With central banks having enabled the industrial revolution; this time around the crypto market would replace central banking to provide the world with the liquidity it needs to spur the new economics, and the enormous technological progress that is upon us. Something along those lines. About a year ago, he wrote how central banks would soon start to add crypto‚Äôs to their balance sheets, and how the crypto market would swallow the PMs market, etc. [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/). Yet here we are now. 

Who knows, instead of a fortress world, or barbarization scenario, utopia (The Great Transition -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Transition) \-  [https://greattransition.org/documents/Great\_Transition.pdf](https://greattransition.org/documents/Great_Transition.pdf) ) might really be around the corner, and we‚Äôll see the advent of the third industrial revolution, the internet of things, the sharing economy, where trust is currency, the demonization of all essentials as Peter Diamandis writes, and ‚Äúradical abundance.‚Äù All in all, a more humane system where, for example Collins writes at one point: *The onset of robotics and AI technologies will further release man from the long hours of labor.  This will fundamentally alter the existing relationship between capital and labor.  Capitalism and Communism, the diametric manifestations of capital and labor, will consolidate around a new form of socialism which is meant to accommodate the expansion of man‚Äôs creative and spiritual ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù*. - [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/)

emw40u,Listening to Schiff vs. Pomp: Thoughts on Gold and Bitcoin,"Gold wasn‚Äôt used in electronics until electronics were invented. Gold wasn‚Äôt used in dentistry until dentistry was invented. Gold‚Äôs intrinsic value is that it‚Äôs beautiful, shiny, doesn‚Äôt tarnish, it‚Äôs scarce on earth, and it holds its elemental state better than most other elements... it doesn‚Äôt tarnish. Because of these properties, Gold‚Äôs first uses were probably as money (and possibly jewelry).

In a similar respect, Bitcoin‚Äôs first use case was money (store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account) primarily because of the intrinsic rules of its protocol and how those rules attracted people who believe in radical verification, which created a network effect and gave it a huge head start to develop a community who could put their trust in a protocol that relies on 0 trust and 100% (or 99.99999%) verification.... in time we may see new uses for Bitcoin that we have not invented yet (similar to how we developed other use cases for gold, which didn‚Äôt exist when humans first started discovering it around the world).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/emw40u/listening_to_schiff_vs_pomp_thoughts_on_gold_and/,the420chronicler,1,2020-01-10 19:47:30,10,/r/Bitcoin/comments/emw40u/listening_to_schiff_vs_pomp_thoughts_on_gold_and/,NaN

&amp;#x200B;

""A fortress soon becomes a trap.""  

If you ever get the chance and take the time to read ""The 33 Strategies of War,"" by Greene you will soon appreciate the value of mobility vs being trapped in a bunker with no way out.  

With Bitcoin, you can ""take it with you,"" your mobility is not thwarted -- especially if you have your pass phrase memorized.  With millions of dollars of physical gold... you're looking at trying to securely transport hundreds of pounds of metal.  You won't be able to sneak it through airports.  If you're carrying gold and you get stopped by bandits, pirates, soldiers, or border guards along the way, you can kiss your gold (and perhaps your life) good bye.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not detectable -- especially if you have your pass phrase memorized.  

If you're preparing for when SHTF and you decide that physical gold is for you, instead of Bitcoin, please remember to check each and every bar in case of counterfeit, gold-coated tungsten.  Remember, you need special equipment and know-how to detect it correctly.  Oh, and have ""fun"" hiding in your little bunker.  Good luck if/when you decide to emerge...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/en8te5/when_shtf_bitcoin_allows_mobility_better_that_a/,Mark_Bear,1,2020-01-11 15:35:27,24,/r/Bitcoin/comments/en8te5/when_shtf_bitcoin_allows_mobility_better_that_a/,NaN

1) Which safe to use full node wallet apps exist for bitcoin, can you list some? I am only aware of bitcoin core. 

2) Can you use a Ledger device with a full node wallet, with which full node wallets is ledger compatible, is there a full list? 

3) Non full node wallets like the ""Ledger Live"" app use their own servers for transaction verification. What is the case if you use a full node wallet? On whose servers are you relying on when making transactions?

4) I have read about people using ledger+electrum+electrum server to run a full node. Is it mandatory to have an own server when using a full node wallet?

5) If there is no need for an own server: What pros/cons are there in terms of wallet security, using own electrum server vs. not having own server?

engahf,Earning passive income with Bitcoin - Need Advise,"Hi,

I have recently been reading about earning a passive income with Bitcoin. Among the different options I read, it seems that a low risk option is digital asset lending. So, I read and found that a few platforms such as [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) allow us to invest BTC and receive interest on a weekly basis. The APR values are not high (up to 8%).

My questions are:

Has anyone here tried the digital asset lending with BTC to earn interest and passive source of income?

Which platforms are reliable? Since lending BTC to these platforms would mean that they own the private keys. I would not be comfortable to lend for long periods of times such as 1 year.

Few platforms about which I read:

Celsius

[Compound.Finance](https://Compound.Finance)

DharmaLever

enl5tf,r/Bitcoin makes me sad,"I hope it's the nature of this echo chamber, but it reading r/Bitcoin makes it seem like people who have no significant assets truly and honestly believe this is no way bitcoin could fail, and they read articles and watch youtube videos posted by people who share that opinion, because being wrong is no longer cognitively acceptable option.

Scarcity does not mean valuable. Bitcoin is not scarce, even if crypto currency becomes a thing it's hard to say it'll definitely be Bitcoin. 

Purpose of money is to present itself as abstraction of work, because exchanging work is cumbersome and complex (perhaps we could make some work solver today, where we'd always directly exact work, when I buy carton of milk, I'd use mobile phone to solve work-demand problem, so that I give my work to someone, where the chain ultimately leads to the grocery store  selling milk). But solving that complex problem of exchanging work is much easier with money, if money itself increases or decreases rapidly in value, that is a problem, I didn't receive or perform more work. 

Historically hyperinflation is about lack of availability of products, there is nothing to buy, so prices go up, it doesn't matter what assets you're holding, because there isn't enough goods the seller can ask as much as the richest people who want that good have. And this lack of goods to buy problem can happen very easily.

If fiat were to fail wholesale only valuable asset class are tools, technical clothing etc, because global supply chains are fragile, they would simply fail and we wouldn't have anything to spend our assets on. It is in everyone's best interest to keep fiat working, fiat failing won't be resolved to new crypto currency future in our lifetime, maybe our children's children could have working global economy based on something else.

There are no fundamentals supporting value of bitcoin in our lifetime, but getting rich is still in anyone's reach.

Because money is abstraction of work, being able to perform in-demand work is always very good investment, learn something that is highly compensated and no matter what medium of exchange is used, you can accumulate it more than you need. If you access to Internet you can in 3 years time, with 4-5h a day educate yourself with no monetary investment to a place where you can work remotely anywhere where you want and invoice at least 100kEUR/YRC, more once you gain experience and become recognised in your chosen industry. If you are not based in Brazil or US you can also entirely forego income, dividend and capital gains taxes by choosing where you live.

This method will get anyone from 0 to first million in less than decade, with assumption that market continues to return 8-9% average. Only hard investment you need, is to put in the 4-5k hours investment to learn to perform work someone wants to pay you for. The reason why this works, is because very few are willing to learn something that takes thousands of hours to learn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/enl5tf/rbitcoin_makes_me_sad/,hmassive,1,2020-01-12 08:40:35,40,/r/Bitcoin/comments/enl5tf/rbitcoin_makes_me_sad/,NaN

I use the [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) wallet.

I would like to import that wallet including all addresses to the Bitcoin Core wallet - is this possible?

I already converted the 12 word seed to BIP44 and BIP32 I've exported all addresses and see all the private keys for each address - I know I can import them one by one. But I want to Import them all at once and have the exact same wallet online and on Bitcoin Core.

eo908i,The Bitcoin Standard Questions,"Hey everyone,

I just finished reading the Bitcoin Standard, and I have a few questions after reading it that I hope you can help me with.  They're in no particular order, just little curiosities and hopefully updates since this book was written.  The book answered a lot of my initial questions.  I highly recommend it to those just getting into this sphere. Thanks to anyone who answers!

\-Do we think people need to understand Bitcoin/sound money in order to utilize Bitcoin and grow the network?

\-Does less volatility and more stability change the incentives for nodes/mines over the course of time? 

\-Is it too much to ask future people/generations to continue to run the network?  The current centralized system employs so many people and creates so much wealth that it is self-sustaining (even if its not for the best).  Can the network expect to continue to run for years and years on the help of volunteer coders, nodes, and miners? Is that the plan, even with growing processing power needed?

\-With the news of China launching their own digital currency and Facebook possibly creating Libra, does that help or hurt bitcoin? Will these work (and altcoins, I suppose) similarly to Bitcoin with a finite amount of coins to create sounder money?

\-What 2nd ledger solutions or other scale-able solutions have been created/improved upon since the writing of the book in 2017?

\-What are the top overall updates since 2017 that I need to know to catch me up to Bitcoin and the network in 2020?

eoee92,Some people that were considering buying and using Bitcoin have asked me some questions about it This is my response:,"TLDR: I think bitcoin is good for humanity, and it‚Äôs worth researching it to see if its right for you. 

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is my opinion.

I started out thinking this would be a quick, one or two short paragraph Facebook post but then I ended up writing nearly 2000 words. There‚Äôs no easy way to give a quick explanation of Bitcoin, and money is an important subject to weigh in on so my communication needs to be clear. I‚Äôm giving my opinion about an entirely different monetary system than we‚Äôve had our entire lives. I wanted to spread some information that I‚Äôve found through a couple years of research and trading. Above all I just want to live in a better world and I think there‚Äôs always room for improvement in all of our systems. I‚Äôm willing to experiment to find out how to do that. The text is footnoted to help you understand some of the jargon and facts. 

I dedicate this to my brother who got me started with this. It‚Äôs his birthday today. Happy birthday Ty. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

By now I imagine most of you know what Bitcoin is or have at least heard of it, but still most of you haven‚Äôt thought to buy any and use it. I think it could make our world a much better place if we all adopted it as a means of paying each other. I‚Äôve bought a few things online with Bitcoin. It can be spent in person too. I prefer to spend it instead of debit/credit if the vendor I‚Äôm purchasing from accepts it, but many still don‚Äôt. I feel safer using it, it is more secure than Fiat currencies. I think if you‚Äôre a vendor, you should consider accepting it, because it gives you access to more customers (the Bitcoin spenders).  

I can understand peoples hesitation to buy it and use it, or get involved in other parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The price paired to Fiat currency1 is extremely volatile. It has a reputation for being used to purchase illegal goods and services, and it‚Äôs an obscure thing. Money in general is obscure because it has no intrinsic value (you can‚Äôt eat it, drink it, smoke it, wear it etc). Worth noting, exceedingly more Fiat currency is spent on illegal goods and services than Bitcoin is.2 I‚Äôve heard many other criticisms‚Äô as well.  The fact you could buy some today, and it could be worth two thirds as much in a just a week; the cause being that many average people (or a few very rich people) decided to sell it.3 However, since Bitcoin‚Äôs inception, it has proven over and over again that if you hold on to it, it will increase in value over a long period of time. By doing this, it incentivizes  saving. People don‚Äôt want to spend as much because it‚Äôs consistently increasing in value, so they save it instead. It increases in value when new Fiat currency flows into it from the public, and less Bitcoin flows out, which has been normal through its history. When more people are seeing that it‚Äôs value is going up, it incentivizes them to buy in. In theory, the ‚Äòsaving incentive‚Äô means that people would buy less goods and services and conserve earth‚Äôs natural resources better. It is still in a very early stage in terms of becoming a meaningful currency that average people use, so these observations are speculative. It may sound like a Ponzi Scheme to some, but then what is Fiat currency if you look from a broad perspective?

The main reasons it outperforms Fiat currencies is because it‚Äôs decentralized, and censorship resistant. No one entity controls it. It is not the property of the bank of any country. Each users holds their own unique keys to their money. It can‚Äôt be manipulated by any government, bank, or corporation. The creator of the software is anonymous.4 It can do cross border payments in a manner of seconds, and for a tiny fraction the cost of fiat, and make what were once inaccessible payments, accessible. There is no borders with Bitcoin. 

Governments tend to print money on a fairly regular basis which can artificially inflate prices of goods and services. Some very corrupt governments have printed so much money that it hyper-inflates their currency and becomes nearly worthless.5 Bitcoin has a fixed supply which will be about 21 million coins once it has all been mined6, so it‚Äôs not possible for it to be inflated. It‚Äôs built into the software to continue slowing production of new coins until it ultimately stops producing them. 

There is still a risk of the price of Bitcoin going to zero, everyone could decide to sell it and it would become worthless. However that risk theoretically exists with many currencies and part of my interest is what‚Äôs happening in the future for our children and grandchildren. Every Canadian could trade all their dollars for, say, US dollars, making Canadian dollars worthless. However unlikely, it‚Äôs a theoretical scenario.

Everything starts somewhere. Bitcoin is brand new, it has only been in use for 11 years, but it‚Äôs possible it could be in use for the next 100 years and beyond. It depends on humanity‚Äôs decisions. 

The picture shown is a chart of the price of Bitcoin over it‚Äôs entire history, relative to US Dollars. It has followed this parabolic curve it‚Äôs entire existence, and never fallen below it. One Bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny when the software was first developed, to now over US $8000. It is, undoubtedly the best financial investment of all time for early adopters.7 If it continues to follow the parabolic curve, it will be worth US $1,000,000 around the year 2030. However, that‚Äôs a big if - no one knows precisely why it follows the parabolic curve, and if it will continue along it. There are only theories. One of them, the Stock to Flow model,8 is very plausible. It doesn‚Äôt explain the parabola per se, but gives evidence of what drives the price.  

What I would recommend if you‚Äôre interested, is to first do as much research as possible, then if you still feel it‚Äôs a good idea, try buying a small amount and see how it goes. You would be helping grow the ecosystem. You can buy as a little amount as you want. It is infinitely divisible. Remember, this is not financial advice. You must be willing to lose what you put in. There are also security measures that you should be aware of before purchasing. I can help you with this if you ask me. Also, as I side note I‚Äôm trying to encourage that people never sell for Fiat, and instead hold or spend it. This is what is best for the ecosystem. However I understand the desire to exchange back to Fiat to make profits that you can spend at the grocery store, or wherever. I do this myself. 

Technically, a trader is anyone who buys or sells. For those wondering what professional traders actually do, they provide liquidity9 for the market, so others can buy and sell easily. There is no get rich quick scheme. It takes just as much work, or more than the average job to make a living at it. In time you can get more efficient, and some people are able to master it and get rich from it, not unlike many other types of business. I am far from a master, but would be happy to teach what I know.  

This only scratches the surface, there are still many questions to be answered such as: how does our society work with this, how are governments responding, how can you loan and borrow Bitcoin, how are taxes paid, where can you spend it right now, what‚Äôs the best time to buy, where do you buy and sell it, how do you store it, how does mining work, what about all the other crypto-currencies, what is the blockchain, what is cryptography, what do you do about slow transaction speeds, and many more. I‚Äôll do my best to answer if you ask me, but some of the answers are just my opinion based on the different sources I‚Äôve read throughout the past few years. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right or wrong about the future of Bitcoin but my estimate is that it will be around for a long time to come. I‚Äôm doing the best I can to piece the puzzle together. Some of the facts I stated could have different interpretations. I did my best to fact check before posting because I think telling the most precise truth is most important, especially for something that could change everything we know about money. I might have got some facts wrong. If you see something please let me know. 

Thanks for reading. I will be responding to comments tomorrow Jan 14th. Get in touch, ask me questions. Ask your friends questions and please share this freely. Cheers.

  
Footnotes:

1 Fiat Currencies are what most people use around the world right now, including USD,  CAD, EUR, JPY etc. 

2 Cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis noted that dark web transactions now account for just one percent of bitcoin transactions, down from 30 percent in 2012.

3 When the software was first introduced to the public, there wasn‚Äôt nearly as many people involved, so a small minority of people who hold bitcoin, hold large stacks of coins from the very early stages of development. These coins are being distributed to the public as time goes on, so intra-day trading can be very volatile in part due to these people selling and buying large amounts whenever they want, and often at strategic times, and likely working together at times. They‚Äôre often referred to as Whales, along with whoever else has large stacks of coins.

4 There are several people who claim to be the creator of Bitcoin software, but there has never been verified proof. When the software was released, a paper explaining the purpose of it was released with it, called the  ‚Äúwhite paper,‚Äù and was authored by an anonymous person who went by Satoshi Nakamodo. Weather the name‚Äôs real or fake we don‚Äôt know, and we may never, and it may be more than one person. The paper can be seen at [www.bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org)

5 Examples include Venezuela, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe.

6 Miners run the Bitcoin software, it is free and open-source. Miners solve complex math equations to verify transactions, and get rewarded for it. The costs of  mining are hardware and electricity. Anyone can mine Bitcoin. Miners get rewarded with freshly minted coins and transaction fees. After all 21 million coins built into the software are minted, there will be no more. Miners are still necessary to settle transactions, and will earn their Bitcoin solely from transaction fees. This wont happen until the year 2140.

7 If you invested US one hundred dollars in mid 2010, and sold in late 2017, you would have made between US 30 to 40 million dollars, depending on the exact timing.

eoigql,A radical new way to mine Bitcoin?,"I have this crazy idea that I feel could Optimize Solo Mining and make it profitable again, and I'm trying to figure out how to build and program a rig so that I could try this:

It is my understanding that, when a new block is created, the miner first generates a Merkle Root from a Merkle Tree consisting of all the transactions that will be listed in the Block (including the Coinbase Transaction), adds said Merkle Root to the new Block's Header, and then tries to find a number between 0 and 4,294,967,295 (the nonce) that, when combined with the rest of the Block's Header and Hashed will result in a Hash with a certain amount of Zeros. If such a nonce is found, then the block is accepted by the Bitcoin Network, added to the Blockchain, and newly created Bitcoin appears in the Miner's Wallet; but, if none of the nonces work, then a new Merkle Root is generated by changing the Coinbase Transaction (but leaving the other transactions the same as before), and the miner again tests all of the possible nonces to see if any of them will result in the proper hash. And all this goes on and on until the miner finds the right combination of Merkle Root and Nonce that will work with the rest of the Block's Header.

Now, because there are 4,294,967,296 possible nonces, this means that the Miner will Hash bad Merkle Root 4,294,967,296 times; which, if you think about it enough seems like such a waste. However, because there is only 612,772 blocks in the blockchain (as of the typing of this post), this also means that **it's quite unlikely that any 2 or more Blocks will share the same Nonce** (not impossible, but unlikely).

Hence, my idea is to configure a miner so that, instead of checking all 4,294,967,296 possible nonces, **an Artificial Intelligence analyses the Blockchain and guesses the best nonce to try**, and the Miner then keeps changing the Merkle Root (leaving the nonce the same) until to hopefully finds a Merkle Root that, when Hashed with the previously chosen nonce and the rest of the Block's Header will produce the appropriate Hash in which the Block will be accepted. This can also be scaled up with work with multiple miners: For example, if you have 8 miners, you can have the AI choose the 8 best nonces to try, assign each of those nonces to a single miner, and each miner keeps trying it assigned nonce with different Merkle Roots until one of the miners finds a combination that works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eoigql/a_radical_new_way_to_mine_bitcoin/,sparky77734,1,2020-01-14 08:11:58,13,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eoigql/a_radical_new_way_to_mine_bitcoin/,NaN

eolzuh,How to buy bitcoin with NO FEE's!!!!!,"Hello everyone,

As i'm sure some of you in the crypto world already know, popular exchanges such as coinbase, binance, coinmama etc. charge fee's up to 5-10% and that price goes higher as the network get's congested. I wanted to share with everyone my favorite way to buy cryptocurrency with NO FEE'S in 3 easy steps via the [ABRA](https://BIT.LY/ABRA5) app. 

You can sign up here at [ABRA.COM](https://bit.ly/abra5) a non-custodial exchange and receive 25$ in [BTC](https://bit.ly/abra5) after your first deposit of 5$ or more.

**STEP 1**

Sign into [ABRA](https://bit.ly/abra5) and deposit your desired amount via ACH bank transfer, or wire transfer it will take 1-2 business days but i've experienced if you deposit before noon then you will receive the same day. 

**STEP 2**

You will receive your deposit in the form of TUSD (a stable coin like USDT). So, now you may just withdraw to your favorite exchange that accepts TUSD. My favorite exchanges are [BINANCE.COM](https://BIT.LY/BINANCE5) and [BITRUE.COM](https://www.bitrue.com/activity/task/task-landing?inviteCode=TGALQH&amp;cn=900000)!

**STEP 3**

Now just trade your TUSD for your favorite cryptocurrency. Checkout the video below to see the process!

eorl45,Is Bitcoin affected at all by the major Windows ECC vulnerability?,"Not a concern troll. There's been talk since a few days about a major (as in: really huger than huge) security vulnerability affecting Windows. Big players got the patch before everyone else but couldn't speak about it. Now the work is out all over the net.

The vulnerability is related to ECC and I know next to nothing about except that Bitcoin it is using ECC curve secp256k1.

Is which way is or is not Bitcoin affected by this major vuln?  Is secp256pk1 simply not affected?

Here's some info: (and for those on Windows boxen at home or at your... Yes, your machine got patched because it's like the biggest security hazard since the infamous conficker).

ep5vql,Issues with Bitcoin ATM's and Mass Adoption,"Hi everyone! I've been into Bitcoin since way back when I first heard about it in 2010. I mined a bit and traded a bit...but it was always about the tech for me. The idea of self-banking...it thrilled me! Fast-forward to 2020 and there are Bitcoin ATMs in many cities around the world. Sweet! I wanted to give them a go and see how well they work. 

So, I started my search on Google Maps...searching for ""Bitcoin ATM""...I found 3 in my area. The first was listed as ""2-Way Quad Coin Bitcoin ATM"", the second was listed as ""CoinFlip Bitcoin ATM"" and the third was listed as ""Coinsource Bitcoin ATM"".

I wanted to get cash for my Bitcoin...since that's the obviously more ""ATM"" style transaction. I have lots of ways to buy Bitcoin...but to sell it for cash? That's what I wanted to do. The first listing says ""2-Way"" so I start there. I get to the address and it's in a really crappy liquor store in a really crappy part of town. I walk inside and search for the ATM...I find it tucked away in the back with a big error message on the screen. I ask the guy about it and he said: ""There was a problem and I think the company went out of business."" Oh, okay...let's try the 2nd option. Before going, I looked up CoinFlip and see that they allow selling for cash...there's even a video on how to do it on their website. Sweet! I head over there and this one is in a gas station convenient store...nicer part of town and nicer store than the last one. Things are looking promising. I walk in and find the machine. It looks operational! I ask the guy at the counter about it and he said: ""people use it all the time!"". I asked him if they usually are using it to buy Bitcoin or sell it and he said, ""Oh, this machine only lets you buy Bitcoin.""...FUCK! I have one more option...the Coinsource ATM that was 20 minutes away. I make the drive. At this point, I'm like 90% sure that none of this is going to work the way I want it to.

I arrive at the third ATM. It's in another gas station convenience store. I walk up and the machine wants my mobile number...I enter it. It sends me a text message with a code to enter...I enter it. It then asks for a scan of my Driver's License. WTF? KYC on an ATM? Okay fine...because I'm desperate to make this work, I will do it. I scan the front and back of my license. I get a text saying ""Your Account Is On Hold Until It Gets Approved"". No telling how long that will take, but I doubt it will be while I'm standing here at the ATM...so I go home. The next day I get a text that my account is active. I go back to the ATM. When it asks what I want to do, the only option to choose from is ""Buy Bitcoin"". The sell option isn't there. I call their toll free number and I'm told that while some of their ATM's allow selling, this one did not. 

So if I want to drive several hours, I'm sure I could find an ATM to sell Bitcoin for cash...but I don't want to drive several hours. Many people see Bitcoin ATM's as a large part of mass adoption...I can tell you that the ATM's that I experienced made me not want to bother with it. If I wasn't an enthusiast, I'd probably walk away from Bitcoin entirely based on this experience.

The purpose of this post is to ask all of you...what has your experience been with Bitcoin ATM's? Have you used them to buy Bitcoin? Sell Bitcoin? Both? Have you enjoyed the experience? Please share your story...If my story is an anomaly, that's great...otherwise, we need to figure out a solution to this obvious problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ep5vql/issues_with_bitcoin_atms_and_mass_adoption/,dexreddit,1,2020-01-15 18:10:01,3,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ep5vql/issues_with_bitcoin_atms_and_mass_adoption/,NaN

They sent me an email requesting that I answer onboarding questions, one question asking me where I get the income to purchase cryptocurrency in the first place. Others included if I was being asked to buy crypto, what platform I was using, who was managing my investments, etc. 

I reluctantly replied and mentioned I was uncomfortable answering their questions as they seemed unneccessary. I answered the questions but my answers were extremely vague and I did not go into great details. For instance, when answering the question about where my income is from I simply said, ""I work"". I mentioned they should contact me if there is any further problems with verification and if I'm not approved, why. 

They sent me an email that simply says, ""Please find another provider."" 

In not too sure how to feel about this. I mean, I understand that I might have been too vague but could they not just have explained that I need to answer the questions in more depth to be approved? Could they have not asked me to go into a Canada Post to be verified in person if they were have difficulties doing so through email? 
Also, is there a better way to do this? Shit, I just want to buy some Bitcoin, I don't want to be interviewed for a mortgage. 

Anyways, you all seem super knowledgeable so I figured I'd get some input. It just totally threw me off I guess..",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eps76i/bitcoin_provider_told_me_to_find_another_provider/,banashley,1,2020-01-17 00:10:16,34,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eps76i/bitcoin_provider_told_me_to_find_another_provider/,NaN

because of this, its my only option.

eq5j4m,[Tutorial] Build and run your own Bitcoin node on Ubuntu 19.10,"I am finally doing my part and running my own bitcoin node in a small home server. 

Most guides I found online were either incomplete, outdated, or explained only how to run bitcoin-qt (graphical interface). So I built a minimalistic guide with the starting point of Ubuntu 19.10 to run the latest Bitcoin core release (v0.19.0.1) as of today.

If you have an old laptop (raspberry pi, NUC, etc even better) a reliable internet connection, and \~ 500Gb of HDD (USB external drive are just fine), you should consider running a node. It's fun, you will deepen your computer knowledge, and you will be supporting the network.

eq9ntk,Love how you can find Bitcoin conversation anywhere.,"I follow a psychedelic YouTube channel called True Life Storys. It's more of a get together between friends and there is always groups of people chatting and talking real life experiences and whats going on. It's kind of like an eye opening channel and I love the topics they talk about which is mostly psychedelics but always diverts into other topics. Today he had a 5 hour show what True calls a marathon. 

At first it started off a little slow so I fast forwarded it a bit and I literally landed on the exact part where they were talking about Bitcoin. I am a huge Bitcoin enthusiast and had no idea anyone on the show was also into Bitcoin and surprisingly enough there was a few guys who are really into Bitcoins and seems like they know what they are talking about. 

If anyone wants to follow the show I can tell you guys a good channel and besides that if you want to hear what they were talking about Bitcoin check it out. I feel any and all talk about Bitcoin is great because the more people aware about Bitcoin the more our community grows. 

Take a look at the video and I hope you like the channel. If you want to fast forward to the Bitcoin part it starts roughly at 2 hours and 24 minutes and goes for about ten minutes.

I made a purchase on https://buyxarmodafinil.org (a https://www.buymoda.org/ affiliate), who were never able to carry out the delivery properly. They've been dicking me around ever since.

This is an obvious betrayal and stab in both my back, and the back of the Bitcoin community.

Had this been a card or paypal purchase, however, i could have just challenged the company and get my money back.

New features of particular interest
===================================

- BIP157 (Neutrino) can be enabled to serve compact block filters to peers. This requires both the `-blockfilterindex` and `-peercfilters` options enabled, and can also be turned on in the GUI settings under the Network tab.

erkkec,Bitcoin has value.," There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created, which is deflationary and the opposite of paper money which is inflationary. Bitcoin‚Äôs value and security is derived from the fact that it is easy to prove that substantial computing power and electric energy was expended to solve a math puzzle. This protects against fraud and counterfeit information. When bitcoin is created by PoW, the mining is authenticated and backed by a verifiable network.

Anyone can create their own currency. But a community is needed to accept the creation in order for it to have value. The world has been transacting with bitcoin for over nine years with a global community. Bitcoin also acts like a stock in that the price can go up and down arbitrarily. A stock price represents what another party is willing to pay for it. Cryptocurrencies function in the same way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erkkec/bitcoin_has_value/,lyambaker,1,2020-01-20 22:06:53,1,/r/Bitcoin/comments/erkkec/bitcoin_has_value/,NaN
erkl53,Bitcoin is not created out of thin air.,"Bitcoin is created through a process called mining. Blockchain, the technology that bitcoin is built on top of, is dependent on a network of nodes that ensures the integrity of transaction history by achieving consensus. (To understand more about blockchain, you can reference this article.) Validation is one part of the process. After validating a transaction, the nodes then need to race, using trial and error, to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle that requires heavy computing resources. The first computer in the network that solves the equation will be rewarded with bitcoins. This is known as ‚Äòmining bitcoins‚Äô. This protocol is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).

Bitcoin mining serves two purposes: it allows for the creation of new coins and facilitates the processing of transactions in the network. Mining requires energy, hardware and bandwidth. If you try to mine bitcoins on your computer, you will find the cost of electricity will likely outweigh the value of bitcoins you can mine. Other cryptocurrencies also use PoW. Another emerging protocol is Proof of Stake (PoS) which does not need energy or hardware to achieve consensus, but rather uses staking or bonding tokens to determine the next block.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erkl53/bitcoin_is_not_created_out_of_thin_air/,lyambaker,1,2020-01-20 22:08:22,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/erkl53/bitcoin_is_not_created_out_of_thin_air/,NaN

erumly,How would real-world purchases with Bitcoin work if the price of Bitcoin varies every minute?,"Because we still use dollar bills, euros, yen, (""fiat currency"") whatever... it doesn't seem to make sense to me to make a purchase with Bitcoin for any reason because the value of a Bitcoin changes in the time it takes to make a convert a purchase from Bitcoin to dollars. 

If I was on the receiving end of a large (millions of dollars) purchase, a 0.1% change in the value of Bitcoin is worth $1000, so I could very easily see the volatility of Bitcoin wiping out the benefits of the extremely low transaction fees. 

Is my understanding correct?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erumly/how_would_realworld_purchases_with_bitcoin_work/,staniel_diverson,1,2020-01-21 13:22:43,26,/r/Bitcoin/comments/erumly/how_would_realworld_purchases_with_bitcoin_work/,NaN

ervqr5,HODL Fuel! TLDR of Bitcoin academic research from survey: Bitcoiners who have been involved longer and who have more knowledge on the subject are more likely to value it as a social movement," 

Sorry it took so long everybody, a few bumps in the road with any major academic assignment I guess‚Ä¶ So I conducted a survey coming up on a year ago with several online message boards that seem like prominent places for the Bitcoin community to meet and discuss. The main purpose of my research is to tease out a way that could reveal the social movement aspects of the Bitcoin community. Some of my findings turned out pretty positive I would say, revealing that especially those who have more knowledge about Bitcoin and those who have been involved longer seem to see Bitcoin for its more revolutionary aspects.

Unfortunately, OP of that thread is actually one of the smarter ones, asking if it's a scam (and then ignoring the advice given, so who knows).

If you get a message saying you've ""won"" some money or bitcoin, or see on social media that someone is ""giving away"" bitcoin. Report it, block the user, move on.

You will send money, either to pay for a ""withdrawal fee"" or to get the wallet up to a ""minimum balance"" and nothing will happen. You'll just lose your bitcoin that you sent. That's it.

Giveaways on social media are the same. You'll send bitcoin for the promise of bitcoin being ""sent back"" and nothing will happen. Bye bye Bitcoin. All those responses saying it's amazing and thanking the kind soul giving away the money? All fake. Every single one.

If you send any bitcoin to anyone on the promise of more bitcoin, you are being scammed and you WILL lose anything you send. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. The money is gone forever.

es6sx6,"My first experience buynig bitcoin no paxful, I hope people can learn from my experience."," 

So as a Crypto/bitcoin newbie, I decided to get my feet wet, and wanted to buy some bitcoins, after doing some research I have signed up on Paxful.

I found a seller who is selling 10 usd worth of bitcoin and accepting paypal. so I decided to give it a go. although he was listing the markup lower than most other listing(red flag number 1).

After i click on buying, i get sent to this chat/trade room, first thing I see is to read the seller's instruction and follow them, and then upload picture of proof that I pay. Then on the right hand side on the chat, his status say to whats app on a certain number if he is not replying. which i followed, he then message me back after a while on whatsapp, asking if i was ready to trade, i said yes. (the first trade where I added him has ended due to time expiry) then he produced a new trade on pax, which i clicked in, as isaw the max value goes to 60 usd, I said, let's just do 60 then.

he said ok, proceed to give me e-mail address on whatsapp for paypal ,which i proceeded with. Then the red flag start coming out, at first he said can't pay to my wallet,( i am trying to use a keepkey, as i said newbie here) and ask me if it was a blockchain wallet, so i opened 1 up, and then gave him the address.

He then tell me Pax has limited his transaction to 100 USD worth bitcoin everytime for some reason, which is happening to him a second time now. so ask me to send over additional money and he will send the bitcoin so i don't have to wait. This was a huge red flag for me, and I said I won't, and the only way is if he opens up another trade on pax, I will pay there, he refuses and said Pax coin locker limit etc etc, which I don't really know what it is.

So after him trying to attempt to get more out of me for 30 mins, he gave up. Then went on the pax trade chat room where i uploaded picture of payment and said to cancel trade as he never got any money, never talked to me. And said I am scamming him.

So i had to start a dispute case, his response in there is just he never chated with me and non status change before, As i put in the chat room waiting for moderator, i just told them to check his activity within 2 hours of that trade.

Then this morning,I checked my e-mail realized the closed trade had a link that was sent to my e-mail for record as it showed that instruction to message them on whatsapp, i quickly posted on the trade room, and when i click in, I realize that person changed the account name, so I am guessing what happen is they have someone else open the first trade using let's say John Doe, then after I added him on watsapp as per instruction, they have another person use that name to open another trade, so it is 2 different accounts, so when i try to dispute it, it looks like I am lying if they purely checked on the second username.

Awaiting decision and response from pax, I have sent in all proofs, and e-mails.

I told the scammer that to be honest, if he was patient and let the first trade completed, I would've lost a lot more once that trust was built. so a 60 usd lesson for me. So i hope other people especially newbies like myself be very very careful, as it looks like they have a scamming ring going on, as their trade history are all small amount with other new accounts within same days or so to boost trading record.

And Yes I know i made a lot of mistake in this transaction, so I am not asking for people to pity, but hope this post serves as reminder that these platforms are not perfect yet, and still a long way to go for trading on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/es6sx6/my_first_experience_buynig_bitcoin_no_paxful_i/,h12f17,1,2020-01-22 04:26:40,17,/r/Bitcoin/comments/es6sx6/my_first_experience_buynig_bitcoin_no_paxful_i/,NaN

I my case I moved it to a very fast nvme and left the rest in a super slow external HD and now Core starts/indexes and shuts down A LOT faster (I sometimes have that machine off for a day or so and needs resynch on startup).

There's no option for separate folders in the UI, so you need to move the folder manually and then create symbolic links.

esspoh,Crazy to consider that the amount of bitcoin holders in the world is still so low.,"This might be a bit rambling, but I was thinking about this a lot very recently and i'm not sure what to make of it. Grateful for any insights you can share...

The global population is over 7 billion people. 

The minted supply of BTC is around/above 18 million.

It is estimated that at least a couple of million BTC are lost forever.

A small amount of individual holders possess vastly large BTC balances. (aka whales)

Most BTC hasn't moved on chain for over a year and is presumably ""not for sale"".

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part that baffles me though:

There are over 45 million ""millionaires"" world wide.

At past and current trading prices, buying just 1 BTC would be a minuscule purchase to this class of wealthy people.

Not to mention the many people world wide who aren't millionaires, but who could also easily afford 1 BTC at past and current trading prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we are 10 years after bitcoins launch and it seems as though everyone knows the word ""bitcoin"" even if they don't understand what it actually is or how it works. 

I just find it so surprising that amongst the vast population of humans on earth, so few humans possess any amount of BTC at all, at this point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fascinating speculative ""number go up"" phenomena of BTC we have witnessed in past growth cycles/bull runs, how is it possible that the global population of wealthy people still have no/little interest in participating in BTC at this stage of the game? 

The ticket to get on the roller coaster is relatively cheap (and divisible to any amount they choose to acquire as per their risk appetite). But again, even at all current and past trading prices, 1 BTC would be cheap for them. 

How are there not more holder in the world?

This seems to be a growing trend. Is it because of fees? I still see millions of dollars being sent for only a couple of dollars in fees, so I don't think so.

I've been lurking here for a while and I've also seen the store of value narrative. Is this a real, viable usage for BTC? Being the OG, gold like crypto where others take the place of payments as we've seen Pornhub and others adopt?

Bitcoin's hard money limited supply properties guarantee that over the long term it will continue to rise in purchasing power.

Now what would be a fitting setup for someone to receive Bitcoin that is just a little more tech savy than the average person, like the balance between convenience for the vendor and buyer and the security of the setup?

etcr53,Recovery lost or stolen bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system known as blockchain.


Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; the cryptocurrency skyrocketed up to roughly $20,000 per coin in 2017, but as of two years later, is currency trading for less than half of that. As the earliest cryptocurrency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of offshoot and imitators. 

Over the years, many many companies have created different cryptocurrencies and different wallets like coinbase, blockchain, binance etc and many trading platforms where you can invest,halve or trade your money for more . 

There‚Äôs as much as $10 billion in stolen crypto out there in the market, according to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of blockchain sleuthing firm Coinfirm. And he wants to give victims a fighting chance at getting their funds back.

Exclusively revealed to CoinDesk, Coinfirm has teamed up with global investigations firm Kroll, a division of consulting firm Duff &amp; Phelps. The joint initiative being launched is called ReclaimCrypto, and combines the latest blockchain forensic techniques with the more established world of legal investigation and asset recovery. 

Kuskowski told CoinDesk: ‚ÄúSo far, there is no one place where victims can go and get help. It‚Äôs almost like they are pleading to get someone interested in their case. In the end, they have to work it out themselves; see about getting a lawyer, perhaps in some other jurisdiction.

After a long research with my colleagues at the University we found out a way to trace and recover stolen Bitcoin and so far we have had over 100 successful ones since we started 2019.

etr5ko,"If you're buying bitcoin because of the ""halving"", you're probably a retard.","Im going to explain why...

The halving is when after a certain block, due sometime mid may 2020, bitcoin miners will begin to receive 50% less bitcoin rewards for mining blocks of the bitcoin blockchain. Currently bitcoin miners receive 12.5 btc per block mined, after the halving theyll receive 6.25 btc per block mined.


As I see it, there are 3 possible reasons someone would think lower btc rewards will translate to a higher bitcoin price:

**1 every other halving it the price went up**

This idea is obviously lacking any semblance of critical analysis. There have been 2 prior bitcoin halvings, around which time, the bitcoin price has gone up both times. True. But our sample size is 2. Thats like saying you flipped a coin, and both times it landed on heads, therefore the coin will always land on heads when you flip it. These are people who dont really discuss things, they just kind of do what everyone else is doing. They dont need to think critically, they have others who do it for them. They hear halving = good, look at a chart, and thats it, their decision is made. Halving = good.


**2 reduction in supply/miners wont be dumping on the market**

These people are worse than the first group, because unlike our ignorant friends in example number one, these guys have done some research on what the halving is. They probably understand what mining blocks is, they understand the history of bitcoin, why it was made, and what it does. What they fail to recognize is that they have 0 understanding of any economic principles outside of the phrase ‚Äúsupply and demand‚Äù. Their justification for buying bitcoin pre halving is that since less bitcoin will be entering the market via miners, and therefore bitcoins are becoming increasingly rare. These people are known to be trying to accumulate 21 btc. Proclaiming there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and anyone with 1/100kth of the world money supply will be ushered into the ranks of the future global elite.

**3 everyone else is retarded and I will ride the wave**

This is the lone bitcoin halvingist mentality that doesnt qualify you as a retard. The idea here is that there are enough idiots in this world who will get dumped on by the people who are currently holding bitcoin, because they heard about bitcoin in the news, or on facebook, or reddti, and bought the absolute top (which is being orchestrated to be around the time of the halving for maximum deception), circa dec 2017. So there is an opportunity to ride the wave up, with the current btc elite, and try to time the top of the market so you can exit and not be left holding this worthless shitcoin with all the normies.

**""but bitcoin is like digital gold, its a store of value""**

Youre a retard. Gold was used for money because it was rare, easily transferable, easily mintable into coinage, and didnt lose volume when melted into said coinage. Silver also has these properties. Aside from these two metals, there arent many that hold the same balance of scarcity and fungibility. So why doesnt bitcoin have those properties? Well, it does. You can trade 100millionths of a bitcoin, its a finite supply, and it cant be transferred to anyone with a computer. Great. Same goes for litecoin, same goes for xrp, same goes for dogecoin, same goes for literally anyerc-20 you want to make that has these same properties. Bitcoins wont be valuable because they dont add any inherent value. The idea of a blockchain, a distributed immuatable ledger that creates digital scarcity, was undoubtedly genius, and it will change the world as we know it. Bitcoin was the first, and is the most well known use of this genius invention to date, but were just getting started. If you think money = value, you will be burned and left bag holding. The only real function of money is that its a medium of an exchange. Its a way to translate one thing of value, into another thing of value. The money itself is not the value. Blockchains will create unprecedented value in our world, in places and ways we never imagined possible prior to this genius invention, but dont be left bagholding because you thought ‚Äúmoney‚Äù was where the value is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etr5ko/if_youre_buying_bitcoin_because_of_the_halving/,RealHedgeFund,1,2020-01-25 14:06:01,17,/r/Bitcoin/comments/etr5ko/if_youre_buying_bitcoin_because_of_the_halving/,NaN

Anyway to cut a very long story short a friend of mine whos been in to bitcoin for a while decided to educate me on it on a drunken night out, obviously i didn't really care to listen so he decided to teach me a lesson.

He gave me an antminer s3 and a link to this group. He said make a wallet set the miner up and for my hard work he will give me some parts of a btc ... 

Now after a whole day of reading through articles and everything I'm still there where i started.

So my question is did my friend just wanted to make fun of me by giving me some old hardware ?

This stuff still working and im just looking in the wrong places for information?

Is there anyone who can help me set it up to teach him a lesson ?:))

eujqah,Make easy bitcoin overnight ($600+)," 

In this post I will show you an absolutely the best method to farm huge amount of money without any investment or requirements.  
This method pays around $1 per one ad click. (You can click 1 ad once every 30 seconds)  
Of course clicking one button for the whole day would be boring, so I wrote a simple script that automatically clicks on these ads every 30 seconds. If you leave your PC and the script running, you can earn around 0.10 BTC overnight! This is absolutely insane. I was sceptical about this method, but decided to leave my computer for a few hours, and they are really paying out. **This is my transaction in blockchain, so you can check that they are 100% legit and paying money:**  
[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/1408605d2b80ad7c7008427515534850e5561e577d172dbafd264cd2b1ebe9c9](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/1408605d2b80ad7c7008427515534850e5561e577d172dbafd264cd2b1ebe9c9)  
Remember that this method requires NO INVESTMENT! All you need is a Telegram account and a script that clicks the ads for you. **Guide:**

1. First of all, download Telegram from this website: [https://telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)
2. Install the App, register a new account by using your phone number.
3. Now simply go to this URL: [**https://t.me/BitcoinAds\_Bot?start=1086929557**](https://t.me/BitcoinAds_Bot?start=1086929557) and click ‚ÄúOpen Telegram Desktop‚Äù
4. Now you can start earning money. Simply press ‚ÄúView ads‚Äù to receive 1$ in Bitcoin.
5. As I said before, clicking the ads manually is really boring, therefore I will give you my personal script to automate the whole process. To make the script work, you will need to login to your account in ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù version of Telegram. Simply go to this link: [https://web.telegram.org/#/login](https://web.telegram.org/#/login) and login to your account by providing the phone number and the code that you received in the app or in sms:
6. Now you should see a Web version of the app.
7. Now simply right click with your mouse anywhere on the site and choose ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù .
8. Now go to ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù. Important: If you can‚Äôt see the ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù or ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù button, make sure that you are using a Google Chrome (as I do), because in other browsers in could look a little bit different.
9. Now paste this script in the ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù and click Enter. **The script will start after 30 seconds**. Now all you need to do is leaving the Tab open, and you will earn 1$ every 30 seconds without doing anything! **Script is available in this link:** [https://pastebin.com/raw/Hf8haJcV](https://pastebin.com/raw/Hf8haJcV)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eujqah/make_easy_bitcoin_overnight_600/,nugjohn,1,2020-01-27 05:53:05,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eujqah/make_easy_bitcoin_overnight_600/,NaN

If you have a paper wallet and say  you dont lose or destroy the paper is it then 100 % sure that in 10 years you still can import the coins to a wallet by scanning the QR   code    ?   Or am i missing something? 

2 those hardware wallets  why are they saver ? If that hardware wallet gets burned or driven over by tank or just broken what then ?   Because if there is a backup why its different then a paper wallet? 


3

I think bitcoin is the bomb and is very usefull although i dont believe it will replace all others   i think its more a usefull hedge and niche pay system still there is 150 billion inside it and that makes the price around 8000 so am i right that if the total abouth doubles to 300 billion the bitcoin price also doubles?

evarme,I want to share my view of Bitcoin with you,"I was one of the Bitcoin pioneers but things aren't good at all.  I don't know where to start so I will start with new users.

1.New users

No one will use their $9.000 hard earning cash and told look honey I just buy 1BTC. So there is no room for new owners. And please stop talking about fractions of Bitcoins

2. Price

Without new users, there is no rise in price. That's very easy to understand. The close $20.000 is the highlight of Bitcoin's price. I sold all mine in that period and secure a good life.

3. Community

That's the worst part. The bitcoin community is full of wannabe, scammers, liars and so one. There are 10-15 good people but that's not enough for industry standard.

4. Industry acceptance

What is this? Nobody cares. Why? There is no money, it's hard for legal tax return and so one. You can't get 60 days guaranty and so one.

5. Future

Now we live in the pre-quantum computer era. Private keys are still secure (7-10 years') but there is plenty of programs waiting for quantum computers. If you don't know how to program I can sell you one of my programs. Someone calls it a lottery but I think that is better than the lottery because they are free.

6. Competition

There is a lot of coins who have a strong community and a much better future than BTC. We don't use money from the beginning so we will not use BTC in the future. That's for sure

7. Life-changing

You can't change a life with 30-50 BTC. You can get a better life but that is not enough. 1BTC will never be $1M so you know what I mean ;)

8. Hard to learn - easy to lose

Crypto is a completely new industry. I need 60 days to make a program to get all private keys. My brother is very smart and loses their private key.

9. HODL

This is the worst part. And everyone who has some education knows that isn't good.

Crypto is a good thing but quantum computers are better than crypto. I want to be more secure in my Tesla. I want my smart house can more than give me a food and air conditioning space.

***Edit - Don't get mad at me. This is my opinion but it will very much coincide with the future. But it's not my fault.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evarme/i_want_to_share_my_view_of_bitcoin_with_you/,adamblake87,0,2020-01-28 20:07:58,139,/r/Bitcoin/comments/evarme/i_want_to_share_my_view_of_bitcoin_with_you/,NaN

evju9f,Bitcoin scarcity,"So after hearing about Peter Schiff‚Äôs tweet about loosing bitcoin for some dumb reason, that got me thinking! Since bitcoin is a finite supply and all 21 million will enter the circulation by 2140, and assuming our civilization will go on for another 1 million years / using bitcoin as our main currency worldwide, wouldn‚Äôt the amount of bitcoin in circulation drop due to people loosing access to their wallets for some reasons? Scarcity is what gives bitcoin its value since there is a finite amount, while fiat money gets inflated. In a million years or so, many people would end up loosing access to their wallets, and that amount of bitcoin would be loss forever (unless there will be a refundable way to bring it back into the system given X amount of years that wallet have been inactive, which seems highly unlikely) wouldn‚Äôt that give bitcoin even more value for every wallet being loss??? If that is the case, after 2140, the amount of bitcoin available in the system  (21 mil) would eventually drop to 1 bitcoin ?

ew26mi,"Blockchain.com Launches Full Turkish Lira Banking Integration as a Native Payment Gateway for Turkey (copied and pasted from bitcoin(dot)com scamsite so no link, sorry).","Blockchain.com Launches Full Turkish Lira Banking Integration as a Native Payment Gateway for Turkey

Blockchain.com has launched a full banking integration for Turkish Lira (TRY) to create a native payment gateway for users to deposit and withdraw Lira on its trading platform. With this development users in Turkey no longer have to incur high fees and conversion rates from third-party payment processors. Turkish traders have consistently been one of the most active countries on the company‚Äôs exchange since it launched last Summer.


Native Turkish Lira Gateway

Blockchain.com, the well-known provider of cryptocurrency products with over 40 million wallets created to date, has launched a full banking integration for Turkish Lira (TRY) to create a native payment gateway for users to deposit and withdraw Lira on the Blockchain.com Exchange. Turkish users can now go from account creation to buying crypto without having to use a third-party payment processor. On the trading platform, Turkish people can now deposit, withdraw, and use TRY to buy bitcoin BTC, ETH and USDT and convert their crypto into the fiat currency of their choice.

‚ÄúTurkey is one of the countries leading the charge to embrace cryptocurrencies, but its traders have only been met with high fees and poor service,‚Äù says Peter Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com. ‚ÄúBlockchain.com is dedicated to providing a fair, global market for Turkey‚Äôs crypto traders, and setting a new standard for the service they should not only expect, but demand from exchanges.‚Äù

Economic concerns regarding the stability of the local fiat pushed cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey to grow faster than in most countries. At the start of the year it was reported that Turkish authorities, alarmed by the rapid spread of cryptocurrencies in the country, are ramping up efforts to introduce greater oversight into the sector.

Local media revealed that regulators are under pressure to increase supervision because of the growing popularity of decentralized crypto assets among Turks. Turkey has an estimated 1 million investors, according to local reports, and a fifth of Turkish respondents in last year‚Äôs Global Consumer Survey by Statista said they used or owned crypto, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in June 2019.

Blockchain.com Exchange

Blockchain.com is one of the most trusted companies in the digital assets space, and has raised over $70 million in funding from investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Google Ventures. It is also known for being friendly to the BCH community, integrating the cryptocurrency into its services. About a year ago, for example, the company launched a Bitcoin Cash block explorer that allows users to search for detailed information on specific BCH blocks, check whether a transaction has confirmed, view the balance of a wallet address, monitor market prices, and even watch real-time network transactions.

Recently it launched a retail exchange focused on high speed performance. Since launching in August, the Blockchain.com trading platform has continued to adopt new features and assets. It now supports deposits and withdrawals in Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, and Turkish Lira, and is available in 190 countries. In the last two months, the venue has launched an API for algorithmic traders, listed the crypto project Algorand, and listed the gold-backed token DGLD, increasing its asset offering to 36 live trading pairs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ew26mi/blockchaincom_launches_full_turkish_lira_banking/,castorfromtheva,1,2020-01-30 08:17:40,0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ew26mi/blockchaincom_launches_full_turkish_lira_banking/,NaN

Is there anyone in this community who can point me in the direction of good educational sources for BTC market analysis?

Essentially, I'm looking for informative sources; ones that present key concepts and important factors that weigh in on future possibilities. 

For example: 

 \- I have found some good discourse and analysis on the upcoming halving. This doesn't tell me whether to hodl or not. But making a buy/sell decision without knowing about this would be an ignorant act. Where can I find some good, reliable discussions about the halving? and for any other major factors in the crypto market?

I photoshopped some screenshots and wasted a few hours of his time until he obviously caught on that I wasn't going to send him anything.

Some screenshots of the Hangouts convo:

ewfyak,I need help figuring out how to buy with Bitcoin.,"I keep asking a similar question but I don't think I've been phrasing it correctly. Now that I understand a bit better I'm going to try again. 

I'm attempting to use an online gambling service to play poker. It's called ignition. Since I'm from the states, I have to use Bitcoin to deposit funds, and withdrawal winnings. A friend of mine told me he uses coinbase to make his deposits to his account. I got a coinbase account, and when I deposited money into coinbase from my debit card, it took 6 days for the Bitcoin I bought to be able to be sent off of coinbase. When I needed to make another deposit, I was told to try it again, and since my info has been verified from coinbase it should be faster, but unfortunately it's not. Another 6 day hold period before I can send my Bitcoin I bought with cash, to my ignition account. 


Maybe I'm not understanding how Bitcoin wallets work, but it's my understanding that I'm using coinbase as a market to buy my Bitcoin, as well as a wallet to send Bitcoin to a business (ignition). 


What I would like to find is a place where I can buy small amounts of Bitcoin ($10-$50) frequently, and instantly be able to send it to my ignition account. 


If I don't have this correct, could someone please explain how this works to me? I keep getting the answer ""wallets don't sell Bitcoin"" which I get, but I'm not understanding why my money is being held for close to a week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewfyak/i_need_help_figuring_out_how_to_buy_with_bitcoin/,BodyBuiltbyTacohell,0,2020-01-31 00:59:06,8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewfyak/i_need_help_figuring_out_how_to_buy_with_bitcoin/,NaN

ewpwkj,Best procedures for storing Bitcoin and seed.,"Hi,

I've been hodling Bitcoin since the beginning of 2017. I'm no trader, just your regular hodler of last resort.

Bitcoin is stored in a hardware wallet and never leaves the wallet. Only time that happened was to sell Bitcoin Cash! 

But I've been wondering what can I possibly do to increase security. Are there good write ups on better procedures for safely storing Bitcoin? 

I'm interested in best practices for everything: how to handle seeds, using steel wallets, timelocks schemes, procedures for making transactions, discussion about hot wallet security (in case I decide to play with LN), privacy and handling public keys, etc...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewpwkj/best_procedures_for_storing_bitcoin_and_seed/,btc2mars,1,2020-01-31 15:20:01,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewpwkj/best_procedures_for_storing_bitcoin_and_seed/,NaN

David thinks it is to risky. 
Now during this 2 week holiday the coronavirus is spreading really fast. David is scared to go home because they will check you and if you just have a little bit of high temperature or cough you will be forced in quarantaine which is logical. But you can not acces the internet and they take your smartphone.
My brother and dave are being advised by the school where they teach not to go home. The school is closed anyway because of the virus. The school want them to teach online now. So David now can not acces his own gold. And probably have to borrow money from my brother. Hey wouldn't have to do that if he bought bitcoin.

Everyday we get a report of the trades and the total profit made. What is also a plus point for me is that the currency used is Bitcoin.

exa2bu,"Bitcoin ""rehab"" for cutting-edge therapies? Make the world a better place?","Hi everybody.

Bitcoin's looming wealth is a gift  we are hopefully going to be granted. This will also be the biggest transfer of funds from the old generation to the new generation. Well, the old generation has always been well known because of frauds and offshore accounts as their ultimate goal, fuelling a deranged capitalism with the main purpose of hiding money in the Virgin Islands and maybe shelling it out in the most stupid and addictive ways (guess how many...) ,basically creating nothing and ruining other people lives,ultimately this to affect the poorest (like in 2008 crisis). Capitalism is a good thing if you reinvest back in the real world the resources you have generated, otherwise it could be just a ponzi scheme. Socialism has also its cons where the service is not enough then corruption kicks is. Anyway, there is capitalism in the western worlds, hence just try to make the most of it.  I'm wondering if now that the new generation will be gifted with this wealth coming from bitcoin ,could anybody be interesting in using it wisely. I'm trying to imagine if the youngsters could be better than their predecessors and as result, be able to build a better world. Although it's plenty of lambo dreams and all of the wild material things as i can see out there, i'm pretty sure we can also find some wise people among bitcoiners here.  Plus, the latest US study shows that happiness stays in earning 70k per year, more or less than this makes us miserable. In short, money should be just a tool and if you don't believe so, then you are the tool. Coming to the idea, this is simple, building the first rehab in Europe where you can actually heal from a lot of mental health conditions like ptsd,depression etc... In a nutshell, giving something back to the world as a service, while obviously earning from it. You have to know that in the US they are legalizing those therapies on a larger scale , to be put in the market in 2021. Check it out on maps (dot) org or google: maps mdma ptsd for instance . As far as we know, the route to legalization in Europe is going to take another 6 or 7 years , due to the heavier bureaucracy . The idea is to set this rehab in a micro-state which are legally out of the EU like san marino ,liechtenstein,andorra or monaco  ,where (as it's written in the sovereign individual, the book) it will be easier and quicker to roll out the US findings into their laws, because they are smaller and can set their internal laws as they wish. This way will be possible to avoid the long waiting time necessary for an EU approval. Nonetheless, people could travel to the clinic from all over europe in a short time,  thanks to central position of these states in the eurozone.  How do you know that this work? I'm a doctor and i've worked with trauma. I know there have been already some crypto funds like the pineapple fund which contributed to this non-profit ""maps (dot) org"" and have made the fda approval possible. Well, we miss all of that here in Europe. We sit at point zero here, therefore we need action. Moreover, i can imagine this project not like a fund but like a proper company where the contributors will be members of the board and will hold their personal key of the multisig wallet of the company, while everything will be notarized.  Where could anybody be interested just leave a comment here or join the telegram group:

*Numerology  is a very old science. Its origin dates back to the Babylonian,  Phoenician and Hebrew civilization. Pythagoras, Greek philosopher and  mathematician, (580-520 B.C.) was the first to elaborate a scientific  theory that numbers governed everything created and had a great  influence on the life of nature and men*  


*Numerology or Gematrics,  which is how this science is defined in the Kabbalistic study, reveals  other virtues and applications regarding the conversion of letters into  figures and their meaning*

**Bitcoin.org**: The domain was created/registered in **2008-08-18** (888) = 2+0+0+8+0+8+1+8 = 27 = 2+7 **=** **9**

**BITCOIN =** B=2 + I=9 + etc **= 9**  
(Features of 9 = Humanitarianism, Selflessness, Highest Level of Change, Giver, Universal Spiritual Laws, Karma)  


**BLOCKCHAIN = 6**

(Features of 55 = Master of Innovation. Freedom, Success, Attainability, New Path Creator)  


*The  so-called illuminati and secret societies often take numerology into  account to devise their agendas, so... or Bitcoin was created by  themselves, or, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" took into account this type of  science to combat the elite with his own medicine, IDK.*

While I had first heard about bitcoin in 2011, it wasn‚Äôt until I watched a documentary and started reading forums about the cryptocurrency that I decided to buy it. It was easy to see how bitcoin could disrupt the entire financial system.

I decided to buy as a long-term experiment and used less than 1 percent of my net worth at the time to buy into bitcoin. Sure, I wanted to make money on it, but if I lost everything, it wasn‚Äôt going to change the course of my life.

As of this writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,600, which makes my bitcoins now worth $1,148,720. It took me five years working 80-hour weeks to make over $1 million saving and investing in the stock market, but with bitcoin, my coins have increased to over $1 million in 2017 alone.

exlnez,I Gave Away Bitcoin Private Keys! - Experiment.,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I recently launched a new project called BitcoinRoot.

&amp;#x200B;

On the website, I slowly revealed the private keys to a topped up Bitcoin wallet. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was presenting my new project to my own community and to other crypto communities I noticed that people were ready to deploy all sorts of scripts and apply all sorts of tools to get it cracked before anyone else to reap the prize, which was around $25. 

&amp;#x200B;

To check out the project I have published a very short video about it here - \][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEn5obPY5wU\[/url\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEn5obPY5wU[/url])

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this brings a question. If people have an incentive to crack a private key with only 14 unknowns and with such a small prize at stake. What incentive is there for supercomputers and quantum computers to crack a million dollar worth of BTC wallets!

exm85b,"Earned Bitcoin with Lightning Network, don't you want to know it?"," For now, choosing the Lightning Network seems to be the right path. After the Lightning Network launched the Bitmain network, it has indeed achieved very low-cost instant payment, which is being adopted by more and more merchants.

This article is divided into four parts to introduce the past, present, future and detailed principles of Lightning Network in detail.

First, the lightning torch movement; Second, the current status of the lightning network; Third, the development history of the lightning network; Fourth, the detailed explanation of the lightning network principle.

**I. Lightning Torch Movement**

A lightning network reward relay is in full swing among Twitter users. This viral campaign is now known as the Lightning Torch Campaign. Just like the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign on social media in 2016, this caused a lot of spread and attention on the Lightning Network.

On January 20, 2019, twitter user  u/hodlnaut tweeted that he sent 100,000 Satoshi (100k satoshis, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshi) to the first selected user through the lightning network rewards application tippin.me, An additional 10,000 users will be issued to the next user. And so on, until the last user is unwilling to add another 10,000 Satoshi and take the bitcoin accumulated by the previous owner as his own, the game is over.

Hodlnaut wanted to see how many Satoshi the reward relay game would end.

Enthusiastic netizens have specially created a website to track in real time which Twitter user the lightning torch has reached. According to the website information, as of press time, there have been 215 users participating in the delivery, and recently one person needs to send 3.15 million Satoshi Bitcoins. The cumulative total of Bitcoin sent has reached 4.56 BTC.

If no one actively terminates the game, the torch transfer will automatically end when more than 0.168 bitcoins are passed. Because the current maximum capacity of the Lightning Network payment channel is set at about 0.168 Bitcoin. Developers are currently developing to increase the capacity of payment channels.

Many celebrities in the digital currency industry have participated in the delivery of the lightning torch, including Andreas Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek, Roger Ver, Bitcoin Jesus, Joost Jager, Lightning Lab engineer, and Zhao Changpeng, founder of Binance , Tron founder Sun Yuchen, Twitter founder and square CEO Jack, BitMEX Research.

Hodlnaut, the initiator of the Lightning Torch, has ordered a Tesla to promote Musk's participation in this event.

Tippin.me developer Sergio Abril said that the Google Chrome extension for Tippin.me has been released on February 17. After installing the extension, a Lightning Network reward button will be displayed under each tweet, which can directly reward twitter users. But you need to open Tippin.me first, otherwise it will show that this user does not exist.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, the lightning torch is only available among twitter users, and you can log in to tippin.me with a twitter account and create lightning network invoice information (invoice). Twitter and tippin.me are closely related because Twitter CEO is one of Tippin's investors.

**Status of Lightning Network**

Lightning Network has grown rapidly since October 2018.

According to the 1ml data of Lightning Web Browser, as of press time, Lightning Network has 6,473 nodes, a total of 28,783 payment channels, and a total network channel capacity of 708.34 Bitcoins. Both the payment channel and the total network capacity have increased by nearly 30% within 30 days.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth noting that another layer of the 1ml name means that the goal of Lightning Network is to reach 1 million Lightning Network nodes, which currently only achieves 0.6% of the goal.

According to p2sh.info statistics, the capacity of Lightning Network Channel is more than 8 times of half a year ago, and 157 times of a year ago. Golden Finance estimates that at the current growth rate of 30% per month, the lightning network capacity can reach 10,000 BTC in 10 months, and the lightning network capacity can reach 100,000 BTC in 19 months.

On February 11, Twitter, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark participated in the Stephan Livera podcast. Jack announced that the Lightning Network was not a question of integration into the Square Cash App, but a question of when to integrate.

Because of the low-cost (or even no-service) small-amount instant payment feature, Lightning Network Payment has been integrated into various applications such as sports event prediction, betting, knowledge payment, rewards, and payment on behalf of others. These integrated apps are called Lapps.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'alls is a paid reading website that uses the Lightning Network to pay, and paying a small amount of bitcoin can read the articles inside the website's pay wall.

Zigzag is an exchange that can exchange other cryptocurrencies to Lightning Network Bitcoins at a low cost and high speed, or exchange Lightning Network Bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies.

Australian cryptocurrency payment gateway livingroomofsatoshi provides various services such as payment of credit cards, bank bills, and rent with the Lightning Network.

Satoshi's place, similar to EOS Pixel Master, people can spend a bit of smart Bitcoin to occupy pixels in the picture. The gold financial reporter spent 1890 Satoshi writing the word ""golden"" in the lower right corner of the canvas (red circled in the figure below).

Competition is fierce, as of press time, pixels have been covered by other users

Event prediction and sports betting website microbet.fun currently provides event prediction and betting functions for four sports: football, rugby, basketball and ice hockey. NBA, Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and other famous sports leagues are predicting the bet list.¬†

Golden Financial reporters tried several Lapps and found that Lightning Network truly achieved at least two of its stated goals: extremely low fees and instant payment. In terms of fees, several payments initiated by Golden Financial reporters have no fees, and the amount can be as low as 1 Satoshi. In terms of payment speed, it is indeed within seconds. The payment experience is not lost to Visa.

 There are currently several Lightning Network clients, the three most popular of which are Lightning Labs' Ind (Lightning Network Daemon, Go implementation), ACINQ's eclair (Scala implementation), and Blockstream's c-lightning (C implementation).  


Lightning Network gives users / merchants a great deal of freedom. Any user / merchant can set up their own Lightning Network node by themselves, and can directly use third-party node services such as lightninginabox and Casa Node to own the node out of the box, as well as open source third-party payment services, such as the open source project lndhub, BTCPayServer sets up nodes and develops wallets for users to use your nodes, and everyone can open a bank freely. In terms of wallets, similar to Ethereum's Metamask wallet, Lightning Network also has Google's extended wallet Lightning Joule, as well as light wallets provided by third parties and ToB payment service providers such as OpenNode and Lightning Network POS system NanoPos.

How does Lightning Network achieve the fast payment experience? Bitcoin analyst JP Thor research pointed out that because the layer-2 lightning network payment does not need to go through a third-party intermediary, the payment between two points can be as fast as the TCP / IP connection, so the lightning network payment speed will exceed Visa. At present, the processing speed of a channel of Lightning Network can exceed 250TPS, and there is no upper limit for network expansion. Visa's current payment peak is 50,000 tps, with an average value of about 24,000 tps. Bitcoin's processing speed is only 7 tps.

In this way, real-time payment is truly realized, and the vision of the Bitcoin white paper cash payment function becomes a reality.

**Third, the development of Lightning Network**

The prototype of the Lightning Network can be traced back to the first version of Bitcoin software Bitcoin 0.1 released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin 0.1 includes a draft of the original code, allowing users to update transactions before they are broadcast on the blockchain to confirm transactions. This may be the prototype of the payment channel concept. Satoshi Nakamoto explained in detail to how the payment channel will work in a personal communication with the then Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn.

In 2014, Alex Akselrod proposed a two-way payment channel, and he is now an engineer at Lightning Labs.

Prior to the publication of the 2015 Lightning Network White Paper, in order to address the Bitcoin scalability vulnerability, PeterTodd designed and implemented a new type of time lock timelock, CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) in the Bitcoin protocol.

In February 2015, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon published a Lightning Network white paper-Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable off-chain instant payment. That same month, they elaborated on their ideas in public for the first time at a Bitcoin developer seminar in San Francisco.

For almost a whole year in 2015, the Bitcoin community focused on issues such as Bitcoin expansion and block size issues. Two expansion conferences: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal in September, and Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong in December.

Soon after the Hong Kong Expansion Conference, Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed a Bitcoin expansion roadmap in the Bitcoin-development mailing list. This roadmap includes the Lightning Network. This roadmap has the support of most Bitcoin technology communities and became the Bitcoin Core roadmap.

In May 2015, the blockchain development company Blockstream hired Russell, the core Linux developer, and hoped that he would implement the Lightning Network in C: C-Lightning.

In January 2016, two authors of Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja, and Elizabeth Stark and Olaoluwa ‚ÄúLaolu‚Äù Osuntokun co-founded a new company LightningLabs to develop the Lightning Network. LightningLabs will develop lnd in Go language.

In October 2016, the third Bitcoin expansion conference was held in Milan. A few days after the meeting, the main developers of Lightning Networks such as ACINQ, Amiko Pay, BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse held their first LightningSummit. This conference discussed how to make all different Lightning Networks compatible and interoperable with each other, and form the Lightning Network Protocol Specification BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology). BOLT became the basic specification of Lightning Network.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lightning Network white paper is incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol and requires some protocol upgrades to Bitcoin. CLTV time lock requires that the payment channel be closed regularly, and the use of relative time lock Lightning Network will perform better. In the summer of 2016, the Bitcoin network implemented a soft fork upgrade called CheckSequenceVerify (CSV).

Before Segregated Witness is activated, Lightning Network based on Segregated Witness is continuously tested. In May 2016, the fourth version of Blockstream segregated witnessed the ""SegNet 4"" Lightning Network c-lightning test online. In October of that year, Christian Decker of Blockstream purchased a photo of a cat from his colleague Rusty Russell on the testnet, which is considered to be the first breakthrough of the Lightning Network.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvhqqaaoche41.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dca1a97d94ce82dd8735b927c2190745fd734c5

 

In January 2017, lnd released an alpha version. More and more developers are starting to develop various applications based on Lightning Network, including desktop, mobile wallets, small knowledge payment platforms, gaming, browsers, and other Lapp applications.

In August 2017, Segregated Witness was activated, and obstacles to the deployment of Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet were cleared.

In November 2017, Blockstream first announced that the beta version of the c-lightning Lightning Network was launched on the Bitcoin mainnet and completed the first transaction. Then, Lightning Labs announced that Lightning Network completed the first cross-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

In December 2017, Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ announced that the three implementations of Lightning Network are compatible with interoperability.

Although the Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet is still in beta, users can't wait to trade with real Bitcoin.

In December 2017, Lightning Network ushered in its first transaction. Lightning network developer Alex Bosworth and payer Bitrefill established a payment channel and paid their phone bills with Bitcoin.

In January 2018, Lazlo Hanyecz, a legend in Bitcoin history, announced that he had successfully purchased pizza again through the Lightning Network. Lazlo Hanyecz was famous for buying pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins.

In March 2018, Lightning Lab released the ind beta version and received a $ 2.5 million seed round investment including the twitter CEO.

Since then, nodes, wallets, payments, and applications have been continuously developed, and merchants and services connected to the Lightning Network have continued to increase, and the Lightning Network has begun to explode.

**Interpretation of the working principle of Lightning Network**

This part is a hard core understanding of Lightning Network, mainly from the Lightning Network White Paper by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon.

To understand the Lightning Network, you need to understand several concepts: 1. Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO); 2. Multi-signature; 3. Two-way payment channels; 4. RSMC ‚Äî Revocable sequential expiry contracts Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract, 5) HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**1.Unspent transaction output UTXO**

The Bitcoin model is not a common account model, but uses unspent transaction output UTXO. Except for mining rewards, there are no inputs and only outputs, and all other Bitcoin transactions have corresponding inputs and outputs.

UTXO specifies the number of Bitcoins that can be spent and the owner. You can only spend Bitcoins at this address if you prove that you are the owner. Prove that you are the owner by unlocking a ""ScriptPubKey"" which is stored in a field in ""Output"". When UTXO is spent and used as the ""input"" of a transaction, a ""ScriptSig"" needs to be provided, and the ""Unlock Script"" and ""Lock Script"" are combined to run. The verification is successful. Allowed and generate new ""output"".

We use the famous digital currency Alice, Bob, Carol transfer to illustrate.

Assuming Alice transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, the ""output"" of this transfer transaction will be set as the following ""lock script"":

&gt;OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The effect of this lock script is that if you can't prove that you are Bob, you can't spend 0.5 BTC.

When Bob wants to transfer the money from Alice to Carol, Bitcoin will first find the UTXO from Alice, then create a new transaction and generate the ""output"" of this new transaction. This output also contains ""Lockdown Script"" for Carol. At the same time, an ""unlock script"" is generated in the input of this transaction, and it is arranged by &lt;Bob digital signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt;. Then broadcast the transaction into the memory pool and wait for the miner to verify that Bob's transaction is legal and not spent.

The specific method for the miner to verify is to take out the ""unlock script"" in the ""input"" of this transaction and run it together with the ""lock script"" in UTXO that Alice transferred to Bob. The specific form is as follows:

&gt;&lt;Bob signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt; OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The verification steps are as follows: 1. Take out the &lt;Bob signature&gt; and push it onto the stack; 2. Take out the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it onto the stack, and now the &lt;Bob public key&gt; is on the top of the stack; 3. OP\_DUP copies the &lt; Bob public key&gt;; 4, HASH160 instruction to hash the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it into the stack, and now at the top of the stack is the hash value of Bob public key; 4. Take out the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; And push it into the stack, where the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; comes from the output of the previous transaction; 5. EQUALVERIFY instruction: take out the two public key hashes at the top of the stack and continue if they are equal, otherwise the verification fails 6. CHECKSIG instruction: Take out &lt;Bob public key&gt; and &lt;Bob signature&gt; for signature verification. If it is true, the transaction is legal.

In the above example, a private key unlocks the corresponding UTXO, also called a pay-to-pubkey hash (P2PKH, Pay To PubKey Hash). For asset security and transaction expansion, Bitcoin also has multi-signature technology. Multi-signature requires multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO.

**2.Multi-signature technology**

The technology that uses multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO is called multi-signature technology. The general form of multi-signature is M-of-N multi-signature. There are N public keys (2 &lt;N‚â§15) in the ""lock script"". A digital signature generated by at least M private keys is required to unlock UTXO.

Multi-signature technology only relies on the OP\_CHECKMULTISIG instruction to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. This instruction reads the M signatures and N public keys and the M and N values, and then uses the public keys to verify the signatures in sequence, and the successful matching counter is incremented by one. Finally, the counter is equal to M and the operation is successful.

The following uses 2-of-3 multi-signature as an example.

Lock script in the 2-of-3 case:

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG  


Assuming that only private key 1 and private key 3 are used, the unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt;  


The composite instruction is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

Run successfully.

However, the multi-signature lock script uses all public keys, and the amount of data is too large, which will increase transaction costs. So now multi-signature uses a payment to Script Hash P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) transaction, introduces a Redeem Script concept, and moves N public key information from the lock script to the unlock script.

The locking script in the new scheme has become concise:

&gt;OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

The hash of the redemption script here is only 160 bits, or 20 bytes, which is much shorter than the previous N public keys.

Original text of ""Redemption Script"":

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

The unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt;  


Synthetic instructions:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

Based on the characteristics of the stack, this instruction first performs a hash operation on &lt;Redemption Script&gt;, and then compares with &lt;Hash of Redemption Script&gt;. If the original script is run like this:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

**3.Two-way payment channel**

With the understanding of multi-signature technology, the first step of Lightning Network is easy to understand. The Lightning Network interacts with the Bitcoin network through a payment channel. Users first establish a two-way payment channel, and the core transfers the user's Bitcoin to a multi-signature address. This is called Funding Tx in the Lightning Network white paper.

We also take Alice and Bob as examples. If Alice buys breakfast or coffee from Bob every day, they only need to pre-store a part of their money in a third-party common account. After each transaction, the two parties agree to update their account allocation. The transactions between them are paid on Lightning Network. The peer-to-peer expansion in the channel (also known as the Commitment Transaction Commitment Tx), the whole network broadcast is not on the chain, and the peer-to-peer instant payment is truly achieved. Only after one party decides to stop using the other party's service and close the payment channel, the final channel status is broadcast on the Bitcoin network, and Alice and Bob unanimously sign the agreement and settle the chain. In theory, as long as the number of Bitcoins recharged when the payment channel is opened is sufficient, the number of transactions in the channel can be unlimited.

**The essence of the payment channel is that Alice and Bob transfer their bitcoins into a 2-of-2 multi-signature address.**

But how to prevent Alice or Bob from cheating when closing the payment channel and not broadcasting the final status on the Bitcoin network? Lightning Network uses RSMC to ensure that both parties are honest and not cheating. If the payment channel is closed, the latest channel status is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

**4. RSMC-Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract**

The Lightning Network white paper page 19 describes how RSMC works:

If the user does not broadcast the latest channel status, it will be punished, and the other party will take all the funds in the channel. Because the funds of both parties are kept in RSMC, he has to wait for 1,000 blocks to confirm (Note: Timelock) before he can get the funds, while the other party has two signatures and he gets all the funds in the channel before him. If the user broadcasts the latest channel status, there will be no revocable transactions. After a period of time (1000 block confirmations), both parties to the transaction will get their own funds.

We also choose Alice and Bob to deposit 0.5 bitcoin each to a multi-signature address to open a payment channel as an example to illustrate how RSMC actually ensures that people pay honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88b73zawche41.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82f8c8396e6d84f61be2f2fc519081689b1eaec4

 

In the picture above, Alice and Bob are mirror-symmetric. It is enough to study one person clearly. Alice and Bob will create a Commitment Transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a and C1b, respectively.

Commitment transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a has two outputs, one is 0.5BTC in the RSMC address signed by Alice and Bob, and the other is 0.5BTC of Bob (output 1 in the figure).

Below C1a, there will be a Revocable Delivery Transaction (RD1a) and a Delivery Transcation (D1a). RD1a uses BTC in RSMC. Because RSMC is a multi-signature address, both Alice and Bob's signatures are required. The RD1a output is paid to Alice 0.5BTC, but only if the C1a transaction is broadcast and confirmed by 1000 blocks. D1a indicates that Bob can consume this 0.5BTC at will. As long as C1a is broadcast, Bob can immediately broadcast D1a to get 0.5BTC.

The essence of the final result of the whole mechanism is that if Alice wants to terminate the transaction with Bob, he can choose to broadcast C1a, Bob can get 0.5 BTC immediately, and Alice needs to confirm to get 0.5 BTC after 1000 blocks. The same is true for Bob.

Consider again the transaction between Alice and Bob. For example, Alice spends 0.1 BTC to buy a cup of coffee from Bob. Now the allocation of funds in the payment channel needs to be changed to Alice (0.4 BTC) and Bob (0.6 BTC). This requires two steps. One is to create a new committed transaction, and the other is to invalidate the previous transaction.

**Create new committed transaction**

Below is the left side of C1a and C1b (the RMC and subsequent transactions are omitted for the sake of illustration); the middle column is the new transaction created by Alice: C2a, RD2a, D2a; the rightmost column is the new transaction created by Bob: C2b, RD2b, D2b.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 57kmkconehe41...*

 

C2a and C1a have the same structure. From Alice's point of view, the number of BTC in the RSMC address that Alice and Bob sign together is 0.4 BTC, and Bob's is 0.6 BTC.

Bob will also create the corresponding C2b, RD2b and D2b, and then the two parties will exchange the promised transaction and the RSMC transaction to complete the signature, and the new transaction will take effect.

**Obsolete old commitment transactions**

At this time, the old and new transactions (C1a / C2a, C1b / C2b) exist simultaneously and are valid at the same time. How to abolish the old promise transaction?

Lightning Network abolishes the old committed transactions C1a and C1b through two methods: one is to exchange private keys between the two parties; the other is to create a ""Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a / BR1b)"" instead of the RSMC revocable transaction (RD1a / RD1b).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nei5s55rehe41...*

 

As shown in the figure above, the input of the new Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a) is 0.5BTC in the multi-signature RSMC, and the output is 0.5BTC paid to Bob.

Therefore, if Alice signs and broadcasts the old channel state C1a in violation, the funds in the Funding Tx multi-signature will be transferred to the multi-signature RSMC and Bob addresses, each 0.5 BTC. At the same time, in addition to owning the private key of 0.5BTC in RSMC, Bob also received Alice's private key, so Bob can broadcast BR1a to the entire network. The RD1a created by Alice needs to wait for another 1,000 block confirmations to take effect. In this way, Bob has all the funds in the payment channel.

The multi-signature RSMC firstly delays the acquisition of funds by the person who closed the payment channel, and secondly, it can provide economic incentives to invalidate the old transaction without cheating, because broadcasting the channel status of the old transaction will have penalties, and the Bitcoin in the payment channel will be fully Be owned by the other party.

Through this mechanism, it is ensured that Alice will not broadcast C1a, and C1a will naturally become invalid.

Subsequent new commitment transactions D, E, F in the payment channel are also processed according to the above process, ensuring that Alice and Bob always broadcast according to the latest channel status when they want to close the payment channel.

The above discussion is the payment process of Alice and Bob, which cannot be turned into a lightning **network** . If there is no direct payment channel between two nodes, they can be indirectly connected through other nodes to form a lightning network. The payment between them is called Multihop payments.

The Lightning Network can make multi-hop payment between nodes through HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**5. HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img le30h85xehe41...*

 

What if Alice wants to pay Dave 0.1 BTC, but there is no direct payment channel between them? Dave will generate a random number R as a secret, and then send the hash value of R to Alice. Alice will tell Bob: If you tell me the preimage of H within three days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Bob tells Carol in the same way: If you tell me H's preimage within two days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Carol can tell Dave the same thing, but time is within a day. And Dave does know R.

Remember the case where someone gave a reward to a golden reporter via tippin.me? At the beginning of preparing this article, the golden financial reporter experienced Lightning Network Payment with Lightning Network Wallet, and transferred 1000 Satoshi to his tippin.me. In fact, there are multi-hop payments in this process. The golden financial reporter's wallet was jumped to tippin.me through Indhub.

The above is the overall picture of multi-hop payment. Let's take a look at the specific transaction between Alice and Bob. In multi-hop payment, although Alice and Bob use the established payment channel between them, the transaction between them is not the same as direct transaction, and HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract is introduced.

 

Through the detailed explanation of Lightning Network above, the essence of Lightning Network is to link the nodes into a network through a payment channel, and then use the mechanism design and technical methods of RSMC, HTLC and other methods to avoid the moral hazard of the counterparty in the payment channel, so as to avoid the need to trust the other party and For third-party point-to-point payment, because there is no need to go online, the bottleneck of payment speed lies in the speed limit of the network, so it can be paid instantly.

According to the characteristics of the Lightning Network, such as payment channels and multi-hop payments, although the Lightning Network now basically achieves the user experience of instant payment at very low fees, there are also some problems, such as the centralization of payment channels, liquidity, and payment collection. People online, routing, etc.

**Conclusion**

Looking back at the development of Bitcoin and Lightning Network, maybe Bitcoin as a value storage currency and payment currency do not conflict at the same time. Bitcoin acts as a clearing network and Lightning Network acts as a payment network.

The widespread use of payment functions will increase the transaction volume of the Bitcoin clearing network, increase the transaction fee of the Bitcoin network, and increase the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Positive feedback makes each other.

The only problem left is the problem of large price fluctuations. Lightning Network payment is based on Satoshi. If the price of Bitcoin is high enough, its volatility may be low enough to become a daily payment tool.

Bitcoin investor Tim Draper recently stated that the world will use Bitcoin to buy coffee in two years, and by 2023 baristas will laugh at those who are trying to buy coffee in fiat currencies.

Maybe one day this will come true.

I have this thought, in the current currency, the value of money deceases as time goes by hence ""forces"" people to use their money in some kind of business or investment. Which creates jobs and promote circulation of money.

In bitcoin, your money gets more valuable as time goes by so it incentivice someone not to use their money which makes nothing for the world. Hoarding money even lowers the supply which makes it more valuable.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have the most upside, especially looking at the long term. If you had invested $1,000 in 2009 when coin prices were $ 0.0008, you would have had $ 28 billion at the peak. The rate of growth is completely unbeatable, making Bitcoin the most profitable investment project in the last 100 years. Many people were skeptical and still are, but today, many countries and regions around the world use cryptocurrencies. Of course, some countries do not support it and explicitly ban it, but this will change over time since legal regulations in any one country have no effect on its value. This is the attraction of cryptocurrencies from a long-term investment perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eydixl/bitcoin_the_most_profitable_investment_project_in/,cryptotapas,1,2020-02-03 20:40:00,8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eydixl/bitcoin_the_most_profitable_investment_project_in/,NaN
eye4u6,Vlogger Ivan On Tech gives his thoughts on the programming part of Bitcoin (C++) and compares it to Ethereum,"When he stumbled onto Bitcoin, Ivan liked that it was coded in C, because he was a bit familiar with that programming language. ‚ÄúI could easily start reading the code and understanding the code,‚Äù he said.¬†

He said if they had chosen another language, say, Erlang or Haskell, while it would take a bit more time to understand, he‚Äôd probably get the gist of it soon enough. But, for me, it was good that they chose something that I am comfortable with.‚Äù

Because it‚Äôs a protocol, C++ was a good choice for Bitcoin, says Ivan. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really want to use Python or other higher level programming languages. With C, you have access to hardware to the extent that is not possible with higher level programming languages. So it is a natural choice, when you‚Äôre writing something like Bitcoin.‚Äù

He never programmed on Bitcoin, but his developer experience helped him learn certain aspects of Bitcoin, like hashing, digital signatures, and how a system of digital cash without intermediaries, without a central bank or company to control everything, works. When he entered into the space there were many colored coins projects, too, which he looked into from a technical perspective.¬†

The main thing that really caught his attention, in terms of building applications on blockchain, was Ethereum and Solidity. ‚ÄúThere you could truly program whatever you wanted and you had the fully fledged turing complete programming language, which is solidity,‚Äù said Ivan. ‚ÄúSo it was a whole other level. And you could really express yourself as a developer in so many different ways that simply wasn‚Äôt possible on Bitcoin. ‚Äú¬†

I was wondering why those were created, besides the point of own personal greed. Surely some of those developers did see something where Bitcoin failed at or could not supply, for instance iota. Even so, why did not those developers join to make the Bitcoin protocol better? Was it impossible for them to do so due to different systemic thought, proof of work vs proof of stake, whatnot.

eynelw,I'd like my work to accept bitcoin,"Repost from r/BitcoinBeginners, apologies if inappropriate 

Sup,

Looking  for some advice on incorporating bitcoin into the business I work at.  Full disclosure, I‚Äôve drunk the bitcoin cool aid and yes I own my keys,  and yes it‚Äôs where most of my minimal wealth is located.  Whilst I am  nowhere near smart enough to truly understand it, I'm in.

My  owners keep asking me about bitcoin/crypto/P2P transactions, mainly  because it seems that it could be a viable way to sidestep the 1.9-3%  transaction fee that is standard in our industry through traditional  methods.

SO in short I am asking, how do you start to accept this currency as a business and what do we need to be aware of?

For context, we are based in Toronto.

eys1ou,Trading Bitcoin for fiat in the EU without KYC,"This might sound like an ad, but I swear I just randomly found this‚Ä¶

I've been trying to find exchanges and services which let you exchange Bitcoin for fiat without full KYC, and especially in the recent months it's been getting harder and harder. All the places that previously used to work (e.g. Kraken) stopped working recently. I never really tried to hide my identity on exchanges - it's almost impossible when fiat is involved anyway - and I used to be verified in a couple of places. But I'm just extremely uncomfortable sending my ID scans, selfies and who knows what else to some web service, which will surely store it forever, and might lose it later in some hack, and suddenly some teenager is taking a credit in my name using this info. For various reasons I also don't want to use the peer-to-peer exchanges where you trade directly with a random person.

And one day I come across this: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/edge-wallet-partners-with-bity-to-offer-non-kyc-fiat-exchanges](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/edge-wallet-partners-with-bity-to-offer-non-kyc-fiat-exchanges) 

I tried it 2 times so far and it seems to work fine. The iOS app itself is shit in terms of UX (the top navigation bar scrolls together with the page, FFS‚Ä¶), but I got the transfers to my bank account, and I got them surprisingly quickly (sent BTC in the evening, got euros in the afternoon on the next day).

Here's more info: [https://support.edge.app/support/solutions/folders/8000087797](https://support.edge.app/support/solutions/folders/8000087797). It works with SEPA transfers, both ways, and the limit is apparently ‚Ç¨5000 per day (!). They take around 1% fee, which I think is fairly good for a service of this kind (ATM fees are much higher). I don't know what law tricks they pulled, since they launched this recently when everyone else is restricting everything, but it might have something to do with being located in Switzerland I guess.

Anyway, just wanted to share this since there are probably more people looking for services like this. Any catches I'm not seeing?

(Note: this is obviously not helpful if you actually want to hide your identity, since your name is right there on the bank account - in that case, ATM or face to face trades are your only option. This works only if you're worried about identity theft like I am.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eys1ou/trading_bitcoin_for_fiat_in_the_eu_without_kyc/,psionides,1,2020-02-04 15:54:08,35,/r/Bitcoin/comments/eys1ou/trading_bitcoin_for_fiat_in_the_eu_without_kyc/,NaN

ezak7a,Beginner friendly 10 page fundamental report on Bitcoin,"[**-Bitcoin Core Report -**](https://cryptoeq.io/coreReports/bitcoin-abridged)

**Overview**

Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs first decentralized cryptocurrency built upon open-source software and blockchain technology that enables a global, permissionless, and peer-to-peer financial settlement layer as well as a pseudonymous, immutable, and censorship-resistant store of value. It is the world‚Äôs first (and largest) unfalsifiable, digitally-scarce asset that removes the need to trust and rely on payment processors, banks, or governments in order for one to participate in the global economy.

**Bitcoin Strengths** 

* The most truly decentralized, censorship-resistant sound money in the world 
* First trustless, permissionless, and borderless global payments network 
* Largest user base / network effects / name recognition 
* Longest history of any cryptocurrency, with 99.98% uptime 
* Transparent and fully-auditable public ledger of transactions 
* A hedge against fiat currencies and US stock market as a new safe-haven, reserve asset

**Bitcoin Weaknesses** 

* Quite volatile when compared to traditional assets
*  Slow transaction times and high transaction costs for small transactions when compared to traditional, centralized services 
* Still a low adoption rate (&lt;1% of the world‚Äôs population) 
* Lack of regulatory clarity by nation‚Äôs governments",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezak7a/beginner_friendly_10_page_fundamental_report_on/,schism1,1,2020-02-05 14:45:02,2,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezak7a/beginner_friendly_10_page_fundamental_report_on/,NaN

ezjqs5,A genuine question about the long term viability of Bitcoin.,"I am a Bitcoin bull who wants to fully understand the economics and technology and I have been stumped by a question regarding the protocols long term viability.

Is a deflationary currency sustainable long term? Once inflation reaches zero and the loss rate of Bitcoin through user error makes the currency deflationary, isn't it then destined to eventually all become lost?  

In this scenario one of two things would need to happen to sustain the currency.
1) add an inflationary quality to Bitcoin to match the loss rate
2) find a way to reduce the loss rate to zero as well 

Deflation is fine for a store of value, but Bitcoin as a currency is so hard that it will never be the choice for spending in its current state.

Any feedback or answers to this question are appreciated.  Maybe Andreas has a talk on the subject somewhere?

ezpxya,Compare market cap of bitcoin against the market cap of a basket of other crypto currencies (and possibly other goods),"Hello,

do you know a website where I can select the market caps of assets, mostly crypto, and compare their market caps, combined and individually, against e.g. the market cap of bitcoin? [Coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) offers a couple of these features but is far from being comprehensive.

I would like to be able to compare market caps, where meaningful data is shown to me, on the click of a button.

ezv3ky,Best way to transfer large amount of money (USD) into a bitcoin wallet?,"**Is there a service with very high fund limits that allows new users to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars from normal U.S. checking/savings/investment accounts into a single Bitcoin wallet?** 

Here's the context: I'm a screenwriter. I'm developing a blackmail/ransom story and I have questions about how this would realistically play out. 

Here's the premise: the Criminals have health records belonging to the wealthy Victim. For reasons, Victim does not want these records to be disclosed to certain people and is willing to pay the criminals to ensure this doesn't happen. 

The Criminals want to be paid in Bitcoin, but the Victim does not have a bitcoin wallet. I have a scene where the Criminals are talking to the Victim on the phone, essentially giving him tech support as they walk him through the steps of getting money into a bitcoin wallet that they have set up for him.

Here's one issue I'm seeing with their plan: there are limits to the amount of funds that can be transferred into a Bitcoin wallet service. E.g., Coinbase says ""...you can trade up to $25,000 a day via ACH from your bank. If you wish to trade more per day, you can wire funds into your Coinbase USD wallet."" 

These limits aren't very convenient if you're a criminal trying to extort hundreds of thousands from a wealthy victim very quickly.

In general, I'm looking for other ways to poke holes in the Criminals' plan, and then find ways to get around them. What other problems do you see with an encounter like this, where you're trying to get a bunch of money converted into Bitcoin very quickly, while involving as few people as possible?

ezzil6,Untold story about Bitcoin,"I have been advocating Bitcoin since the beginning, so I will share with you some interesting things about Bitcoin.

1) When we first started transferring Bitcoin to each other, we were all just playing.

2) We started to connect and very quickly the decision was made to make Bitcoin popular so we could make some money.

3) At that moment we have a group where we talk about what to do and when (about 1000 people - closed)

4) We all agree that we will start blogging about bitcoin, making apps, newsletters and other things.

5) What we cannot agree on is the price of Bitcoin. Why? Because some of us have 100,000+ Bitcoins and some of us only have small 1-5 BTCs

6) We all have some models for the price of Bitcoin and they all have their own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe price.

7) And then everything went wrong. Fake news, cheats, scams, etc.

8) We all know from the beginning that ordinary people cannot use BTC because they cannot learn.

9) If we don't help them learn from our example.

10) I‚Äôm ready to try and help again.

You all know why I left. If you want me to be part of Bitcoin again bc1qanr66ncrahlrhue6t52cuwx2cw8fzchv2w7sxv",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezzil6/untold_story_about_bitcoin/,adamblake87,1,2020-02-06 21:32:05,15,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezzil6/untold_story_about_bitcoin/,NaN

* Fx speculators speculating, instead of doing something useful

*Professional Fx hedgers on staff for all major multinational companies. They could instead be doing something useful

*Central bank employees, having to read astrological signs and spout bullshit, instead of doing something useful

*Professional traders having to follow FOMC meetings and interpret fed bullshit instead of doing something useful

*Endless banking regulations and compliance costs involving armies of lawyers, who could instead be doing something useful

*Creating political incentives for politicians to use the printing press to buy elections through bribes and wars, hiding where the money is really coming from. 

*Distorting market signals, creating uncertainty and fear, discouraging investment. Accentuating boom bust cycles.

*Forcing people to spend instead of save, destroying their long term economic &amp; human capital by destroying long term incentives, creating a cultural of minute to minute consumerism and eschewing long term thinking

*Printing Press electricity, labor, capital

Some costs associated with Bitcoin:

*Cost for the individual to secure his/her Bitcoin

*Mining cost, Tx cost. Electricity + coolant + hardware.

*Cost of  ruthlessly minimized blockchain governance

f0898c,Bitcoin likely go above 10000 USD,"Bitcoin prices are steadily rising above $ 9,500 and $ 9,750 against the U.S. dollar. BTC will most likely exceed $ 10,000 and could trigger a strong rally towards $ 10,400 or $ 10,650.

Bitcoin should pause above the $ 10,000 barrier against the US dollar.

Many supports are forming near USD 9,700 and USD 9,500.

An important rising channel is forming on the hourly chart of the BTC / USD pair  with support near USD 9,710.

Successful completion above the $ 10,000 barrier may trigger a massive stop-run.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xn3x6y7bzgf41.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4f1a25abd3ac13ed9c56d4b0d04c598121b37e

**Bitcoin is expected to exceed $ 10,000**

In recent sessions, there has been a steady surge in bitcoin above the USD 9,500 resistance against the US dollar. BTC even moved above the USD 9,700 level and convinced with a closing price above the simple moving average of 100 hours.

Eventually, the price climbed above $ 9,800 and reached a new high of 2020 at $ 9,850. Gains above the $ 9,700 support area are currently being consolidated. The last swing low was $ 9,656 and the high was $ 9,836. [Bitcoin halving 2020](http://thecryptobasic.com/) may be coming in to increase the price

Bitcoin corrected below the 23.6% fib retracement level of the upward move from the low of $ 9,656 to the high of $ 9,836. However, the bulls protect the $ 9,750 range. More importantly, the hourly chart of the BTC / USD pair forms an important ascending channel with support near USD 9,710.

On the upside, there are short-term hurdles near the $ 9,850 and $ 9,880 levels. The current structure suggests that the price of a major upward break is above the USD 10,000 resistance area.

If there is a successful breakthrough above $ 10,000, it could trigger a strong rally and a stop-loss hunt. In the case mentioned, the bulls should aim for a test of $ 10,400 or even $ 10,500 in the coming sessions.

**Dips remain supported**

Initial support is near the transmitter at $ 9,700. In addition, the 50% fib retracement level of the upward move from the low of $ 9,656 to the high of $ 9,836 is $ 9,746.

If channel support falls, the bitcoin price could correct towards the $ 9,600 support area. Main support is near the $ 9,520 and $ 9,500 levels below which there is a risk of a short-term turnaround that could lead to a bear market.

**Technical indicators:**

Hourly MACD - The MACD is moving back into the bullish zone.

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) - The RSI for BTC / USD is now well above the 50 level with a positive angle.

Major support levels - $ 9,700, followed by $ 9,500.

Major resistance levels - $ 9,850, $ 10,000, and $ 10,400.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f0898c/bitcoin_likely_go_above_10000_usd/,jakkkmotivator,1,2020-02-07 09:37:42,5,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f0898c/bitcoin_likely_go_above_10000_usd/,NaN

f0a357,How to make Bitcoin payments easier?,"I think a lot of us have seen videos comparing Bitcoin now to how Email was in the past. It was a complicated mess. Not that Bitcoin is as complicated anymore, but it has a lot of room to become more user friendly.

What sort of things would make it easier to buy/sell goods and services.

Mobile Payments: If walking into a brick and mortar store, using NFC on your phone for payment seems really simple and convenient. It would be nice to have an app like Samsung pay where you can swipe your card up and pay using NFC.  
Right now, opening an app, selecting the make payment, taking a picture of the QR code, confirming, maybe 2fa seems like a lot of hoops to go through to buy a coffee (when the time comes). Any way to stream line this?

PC Payments: Is relatively straight forward, a matter of copying and pasting (with 2fa). Still a lot of hoops to go through if you compare it to something like Amazon's one click pay. Any solutions to make PC payments easier? 

Addresses: I don't think I've met anyone that feels BTC wallet addresses are comfortable. 99% of people probably copy and paste their addresses. Would it be possible in the future to simplify this? for example [John\_smith@BTC.com](mailto:John_smith@BTC.com)  
I heard a company called UnstoppableDomains were trying to do this, I don't know how it's progressing though.

f0hhrz,"""When you‚Äôre looking to be a government regulated entity, you have to follow all the rules. You can‚Äôt allow anonymity anymore."" Jason Seibert (securities lawyer) on rejected bitcoin exchanges.","The NYDFS rejected Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex‚Äôs BitLicense application, and the resulting rejection letter serves as a blueprint for anyone looking to do crypto business in the Empire State.

For securities lawyer Jason Seibert, who has served on several landmark crypto cases, the crux of Bittrex‚Äôs rejection letter is on Page 4 in Paragraph D. ¬†He says it offers the 10,000-foot view of what it takes to operate a crypto exchange.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Bittrex has failed to demonstrate responsibility, financial and business experience, or the character and fitness to warrant the belief that its business will be conducted honestly, fairly, equitably and carefully,‚Äù reads the NYDFS rejection letter of Bittrex, which requested that the exchange provide within two weeks of the rejection ¬†written confirmation that it had stopped operating in New York State and doing business with its residents.

What‚Äôs clear is that anyone looking to operate as an exchange in New York State must abide by the Five Pillars of KYC and AML:  


* internal controls;
* the designation of a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/AML officer;
* a BSA/AML training program;
* independent testing to test programs;
* and a risk-based, customer due-diligence procedure

‚ÄúFor instance, you have to be able to know if there‚Äôs somebody that‚Äôs on a sanctions list or an OFAC list,‚Äù explains Mr. Seibert, referencing the Office of Foreign Assets Control. ‚ÄúSo, ¬†it becomes an issue if an exchange doesn‚Äôt even know who their customers are due to the ability for users to create a false name or an alias account.‚Äù

Seibert points out that no one is going to win points with the regulator when they allow Elvis Presley to trade, as was the case with Bittrex.

‚ÄúAn exchange must see some form of ID, some sort of registration, some sort of link between an actual person and an account,‚Äù explains Seibert. ‚ÄúYou can run an actual ID against a database like OFAC to make sure that it isn‚Äôt a sanctioned Russian who‚Äôs not supposed to be doing business in the United States or someone laundering money through a cryptocurrency exchange because they‚Äôve created a false account. That‚Äôs the issue with these anonymous accounts. When you‚Äôre looking to be a government regulated entity, you have to follow all the rules. You can‚Äôt allow anonymity anymore.‚Äù

My guess is that if bitcoin is considered a stable deflationary investment, detached from human error and corruption (like stocks), then people will put their money on bitcoin instead of taking huge loans to buy a house. Even if the bank goes down, you still have your bitcoin.
Less people taking loans to buy houses means lower prices for houses.

f0njlc,how i got scammed using bitcoin,"i received a phone call from some scammers advising me that myself and my company were currently being investigated by IRS for tax fraud and that if we didn‚Äôt resolve the matter asap I might end up being arrested.

They made it so real and convincing that they went ahead and told me that there‚Äôs already a warrant of arrest issued by a federal judge named Colleen McMahon and that York regional police will be giving me a call soonest. I quickly went on google to check out who Colleen Mcmahon was and realized he was the chief judge for District Court for southern District of New York.

It was so persuasive and believing that I couldn‚Äôt doubt the legitimacy of the information. It was so incontestable because they knew some of my very personal informations including my address, business name, company bank details, my EIN, Social Security number and all you can think of. Soon my phone rang and the number displayed showed ‚ÄòYork regional police‚Äô at this point I became very paranoid.

They eventually had their way in convincing me to withdraw $21,500 from my BOA and take it to a coinsource Bitcoin ATM in 35th Street where I deposited the money into a bitcoin atm where the machine converted the money I brought to Bitcoin and transferred the funds to a wallet address given to me by the caller. This was the first ever time i‚Äôll hear about bitcoin and they were so convincing that they said it was a new method used by IRS to receive payment from tax defaulters.

They're very convincing and they keep at it, they said there's a warrant for your arrest, and York Regional Police will be giving you a call shortly.

I got back to the office and I slept off. Suddenly it dawned on me what had just happened. It was as if I was under a spell.

I immediately proceeded to York regional police station to report what had just happened and they told me I had been scammed and that the nature of the currency means that once conversion is made to bitcoin, it becomes almost practically impossible to recover the money. They then told me they suspected insider dealings for them to have had privy to that amount of information about me.

Fortunately a friend in the Fintech told me about an uptick in digital heists of virtual currencies that has left many people scammed of their hard earned money. He then told me to send a report immediately tocyberhacksz@protonmail .com they eventually helped her in recovering my funds. if anyone has lost money to this kind of scam cyberh4cks .com should be your best bet in recovering lost funds online.

I‚Äôm posting this so everyone will be weary of the latest strategies used by these scammers in fleecing unsuspecting member of the public of their hard earned funds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f0njlc/how_i_got_scammed_using_bitcoin/,MysteriousWord3,1,2020-02-08 06:01:29,13,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f0njlc/how_i_got_scammed_using_bitcoin/,NaN

I live just outside NYC and I can't possibly find a way to trade bitcoin for USD cash in person on LocalBitcoins anymore, in either NYC or NJ. 

What I used to do with folks was simple. They came to me with a phone with a bitcoin wallet and a pocket full of money. I'd bring my phone with a bitcoin wallet full of bitcoins (this was back when they weren't worth much, so I brought quite a few BTC). I'd scan their QR code, they'd hand me the money, I'd make sure it's all legit, and then I'd send them the bitcoins and be on my way. But I can't find any website that can facilitate that, or at least none that have any reputation.

f127g8,Senator Eric Brakey (Republican - Maine) position statement on cryptocurrency freedom (Bitcoin &amp; Monero mentioned),"I recently spoke with [Eric Brakey (R-Maine)](https://ericbrakey.com/) and he has provided me with a position statement on the topic of cryptocurrency freedom (specifically mentioning Bitcoin &amp; Monero) which I am including further below.  Brakey plans ""to support legislation to eliminate all taxes on 'like-kind exchange,' stopping the federal government from taxing conversion between cryptocurrencies.""

I encourage everyone who values their cryptocurrency freedom to strongly consider donating to Eric Brakey and supporting him.  I am confident that if he wins, he will be our champion for cryptocurrency freedom (and many other freedoms) in the United States House of Representatives.

During Eric's Maine State Senate campaign in January 2014, he visited the [Bitcoin Center NYC](https://bitcoincenternyc.com/) (founded by Nick Spanos) to raise money and became the [first candidate in his state to accept campaign donations in bitcoins](https://www.ibtimes.com/new-yorks-bitcoin-center-where-cryptocurrency-elite-newbies-gather-1547823).

I've written a short bio of him below, and further below, I've included his official statement on cryptocurrency.

\---

Eric Brakey (R-Maine) is a libertarian from Maine who is taking Dr. Ron Paul's message of liberty, peace, and prosperity to the next level, and his work is making a real difference.  Eric was the Maine State Director for the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign.  He led Ron Paul supporters to win a majority of Maine delegate seats to the 2012 Republican National Convention and won key seats on the Maine Republican State Committee and National Committee.

After working for Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign, Brakey led Defense of Liberty PAC, a libertarian political action committee in Maine.  He also ran and won a seat in the Maine State Senate, serving from 2014-2018.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention, he sponsored amendments to the platform including supporting legislation for ""Right To Try"" medicines not approved by the FDA for terminally ill patients, auditing the Pentagon, and abolishing the IRS.

During his time in the Maine State Senate, Eric Brakey helped pass a constitutional carry bill which removed Maine's requirement for law abiding citizens to obtain a permit to carry a concealed firearm.  He also helped pass welfare reform legislation to prevent the misuse of welfare funds.  He helped pass Right To Try legislation, was the only ""no"" vote against the crony capitalist Maine Capital Investment Fund, opposed credits and exemptions (corporate welfare), and supported the elimination of Maine's business income tax.

Brakey has also sponsored legislation to repeal restrictions on medical marijuana, and supported the Maine Marijuana Legalization ballot question which ultimately legalized the adult usage, cultivation, and sale of marijuana in Maine.  He opposes civil asset forfeiture, and introduced legislation that would require a property owner to be convicted of a crime before the government could forfeit that property.  He has also proposed criminal justice reforms including the expungement of certain non-violent criminal records 5 years after completion of the sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

Eric Brakey is currently running as a Republican candidate in the U.S. House of Representatives 2020 election for Maine's second district against incumbent Jared Golden (Democrat).

\----------

ERIC BRAKEY POSITION STATEMENT ON CRYPTOCURRENCY FREEDOM

\----------

I believe in cryptocurrency freedom.

&amp;#x200B;

When I ran for State Senate in 2014, I was the first candidate in state history to accept cryptocurrency donations. During my time in the legislature, I sponsored the first ever bill in the nation to study the use of blockchain technology to make elections more secure and transparent.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am running for Congress and I am committed to cryptocurrency freedom. Whether your coin of choice is Bitcoin, Monero or any other, your freedom to buy and sell in cryptocurrency should be as unrestricted as your ability to buy and sell in federal reserve notes. That's why I intend to support legislation to eliminate all taxes on ""like-kind exchange,"" stopping the federal government from taxing conversion between cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

If you would like to have a champion for cryptocurrency freedom fighting for you in Congress, then please invest in our campaign. We accept donations in cryptocurrency and federal reserve notes.

Free Maine,

Sen. Eric Brakey

f127nx,[Call to Action] Make your political contributions in Bitcoin (HowTo),"As the political season heats up I've patiently waited for politicians to install BTCPay servers to allow bitcoin contributions.  I'm now realizing that the wait will likely take forever.  Then I realized I didn't need to wait.  I can send anyone bitcoin anytime I want using an expiring paperwallet.  It's all totally legit.  Works like this:

1. Any ""gift"" to a campaign is an ""in-kind"" contribution.
2. Disclosure of personal information is only required for contributions above $200.
3. Paper wallets can easily be mailed to the campaign headquarters just like checks.
4. You should keep the private keys and revoke the funds after 90 days (or whatever).
5. The more paper wallets the receive, the more likely they are to favor bitcoin.

Be aware, your contribution will likely just get stolen by a volunteer, so don't go overboard.

If everyone on this subreddit who plans (or can) vote in the upcoming elections were to give 11,000 SAT to the candidate of their choice, eventually they would have enough to warrant getting a exchange account KYC'ing and going through all the same pains we go through to comply with US AML/KYC law.  Possibly provide them a way to walk a mile in our shoes.  It will also show these candidates that bitcoin can be sued ""for good"" and isn't just for drug runners.

Although you don't need to fill out a disclosure for small ( &lt; $200 ) contributions, it is still probably a good idea to do so.  What you should disclose is Name, Address, Employer, and Occupation.  You will also need to sign a statement attesting that you are not contributing on behalf of a labor union, federal contractor, or foreign national (unless a lawful US resident).

As warned above, care should be taken in how much you put on the wallet.  It's just like cash, so any volunteer opening mail could swipe it.  You also need to be careful to only use a trusted wallet.  The `bitaddress.org` is broadly trusted and a good default choice.  I ported it to python in the `pypaperwallet` module, but  most people will likely stick with `bitaddress.org` as it has had years to build trust and reputation.  Obviously you should download the zip and run it locally so as not to trust a web server with private keys.

## Basic `bitaddress.org` HowTo:

1. Download zip from https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/tree/v3.3.0
2. Download PGP key from https://www.bitaddress.org/ninja_bitaddress.org.txt
3. Import Ninja's expired key that you downloaded in [2] into GPG.
4. Verify Ninja's key fingerprint matches the fingerprint in his [BitcoinTalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=43496.0)
5. Unzip the zip downloaded in [1] and enter that directory
6. Verify the file `bitaddress.org.html.sig` using Ninja's expired key
7. Open the `bitaddress.org.html` file in Chrome
8. Print the paper wallet and fund it with a few dollars worth of BTC
9. Include a letter attesting that you aren't a foreign influencer, with a union, or contractor
10. Include your Name, Address, Employer and Occupation in the letter and sign it
11. Make a copy of the wallets private key to void the wallet after 90 days
12. Mail the wallet and signed letter to the campaign of your choosing
13. If the funds haven't moved after 90 days, sweep them back to yourself

I've produced the form letters in `pypaperwallet`, but as I said, it's a new repo from some random redditor.  In any case, here's the howto for my module:

## Basic `pypaperwallet` HowTo:

1. Find latest release at https://github.com/brianddk/pypaperwallet/releases
2. Expand ""Assets"" and download the ""Source code (tar.gz)"" as `pypaperwallet.tar.gz`.
3. Download the `*.tar.gz.sig` file naming it `pypaperwallet.tar.gz.sig`
4. Verify download with `gpg --verify pypaperwallet.tar.gz.sig`
5. Extract the contents of the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file to any directory
6. From Python 3.7 run `pip install pypaperwallet.tar.gz` to install dependencies
7. Review the `README.md` on how to install the GTK `cairo` dependency
8. Modify `test.py` to your liking and run from python 3.7 to produce the PDFs.
9. To change wording, modify the contents of `template.py`

f13e2y,A fun story about losing $5.00 worth of 2008/2009 bitcoin ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"In 2008/2009 I was flat. broke. Riding home from my shitty $27,000 per year job and listening to an NPR report about a new form of currency called bitcoin I decided to spare five precious dollars to try it out one night. I didn‚Äôt tell my then-fianc√© because he‚Äôd have been mad I was wasting $5 when we couldn‚Äôt afford to eat. I didn‚Äôt tell my dad because he would have thought it was too bizarre to take a chance on. I remember it being complicated to buy and relatively over my head. It was only worth $5 and I couldn‚Äôt understand how to utilize it so I forgot about it. Sold the computer a year later and wiped the hard drive before I sold it. 

Sometimes my dad, who eventually came around to the idea of cryptocurrency, harasses me about how I have $200,000 or whatever just floating somewhere in the ether with my name on it. ‚ÄúMaybe you emailed it to yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúWould you have emailed it to yourself back then? Remember dad, it was a relatively obscure form of digital currency worth FIVE DOLLARS.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe you printed it out and saved it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, and maybe I also saved all my $5 McDonald‚Äôs receipts from 2008 too‚Äù

f1r71g,Help required to establish bitcoin is money,"I have created a new site [https://bitcoinismoney.info/](https://bitcoinismoney.info/) and I need the community's help. I am collecting and collating links that refer to bitcoin as money rather than a digital asset.

Moneys/monies (including cash) are not usually subject to taxes when they are transacted. Digital assets however tend be treated in the same way as stocks or shares and are usually subject to Capital Gains Tax and may be regulated as securities.

This argument is not about avoiding tax‚Äîit is about the principle that exchanging one money for another (including non-government money) should not be taxed. When bitcoin is exchanged for another money (dollars, pounds, yen or another crypto-currency) no tax should be payable. This principle is already accepted by tax authorities for government monies (unless you are a professional trader paying tax on your profits). Taxes on non-government money are unfair and will stifle innovation, and prevent a currency of the internet

Unfortunately, (largely due to a lack of experience of a digital asset that can also function as a money), governments are coming down on the side of bitcoin being like a stock or share. This is patently absurd as bitcoin does not pay any dividends or act like a stock. It has been done to adapt new technology into an old rulebook.

Satoshi‚Äôs vision of bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash will never be realised if it is treated as a tradeable stock or security.

Please can you send me your references? We want links or references to:

* Articles, Web pages etc. in which bitcoin is described or written about as money
* Jurisdictions where bitcoin is treated as money
* Institutions or banks that regard bitcoin as money
* Submissions to legal or regulatory bodies that argue bitcoin is money
* Rulings or adjudications that bitcoin is money
* Significant money-like transactions involving bitcoinÔªø
* Significant money-like systems involving non-government tokens (for example in-game)
* Books on bitcoin as money
* Academic research on bitcoin as money including definitions of money, cash or currency

and

* Reasoned arguments that bitcoin is NOT money (for analysis)

f1t95x,Dawn in Malaga. Let¬¥s spread BITCOIN Ecosystem through youngsters,"Hi guys,

Just wanted to share this morning picture could not resist adding QR on it. All tips received will be used for a good cause such as spreading **Bitcoin** Ecosystem here in the south of Spain across secondary schools.

I am a student of **Andreas Antonopoulo**s MOOC and would like to contribute to the ecosystem by giving  talks to youngsters and after each talk, help them installing their mobile wallets and sending some Sats. You all can check the address and amount will be split in 1000 - 2000 Sats, according to the amount given by the community.

I¬¥ve seen all of Andreas¬¥ videos and after two years of studying, testing and researching, I think I¬¥d feel confident giving talks to young people. Something I¬¥d like to have If I was a newbie would be good information in Spanish... and I think I can help!

Of course, I¬¥ll send proof of speech and let them know it was possible thanks to the Bitcoin Reddit Community.

What do you think?

Thanks guys! I¬¥ll let you know about the outcome and If I get good feedback I¬¥ll keep doing this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

f1xun4,Another halving explanation - Why the halving will cause the next Bitcoin bull run.,"The halving will cause another Bitcoin bull run because that's what the halving is designed to do. And it'll do it again and again and again every four years. We've seen this happen twice before with the previous 2 halvings. There's no reason to expect anything different for the upcoming halving this may. 

The halving cuts Bitcoin's inflation rate in half. This drives scarcity, which in turn drives a higher and higher price for Bitcoin. 

This spectacular performance on investment draws more and more attention, which drives more and more people to learn about Bitcoin and realize what Bitcoin is. Once people understand enough about Bitcoin, they invest. 

Then the network effect kicks in and drives the price parabolic. Rinse and repeat on a 4 year cycle. This may will be the third halving. It's almost a religious holiday for Bitcoiners. 

Why does the halving increase the price? It's because cutting the creation rate of new Bitcoins reduces the sell side pressure. If the buy side pressure remains the same, the price will necessarily rise. The rising price usually draws more attention and more new investors. 

This, combined with the fact that there's 7.7 billion people and only 21 million BTC, means that the price of Bitcoin will continue to go parabolic.

Just imagine what the price of Bitcoin will be in 12 years after 3 more Bitcoin halvings. 

Cryptocurrency is all about security. What secures cryptocurrency? The hash rate is the most important factor. Which cryptocurrency has the highest hash rate? Bitcoin and its not even close. https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate

Bitcoin is the most ultimate form of wealth storage ever invented. Control of Bitcoin is so diversified that changing Bitcoin is nearly impossible, unless the vast majority of the community agrees. It's harder than removing a president through impeachment. 

Bitcoin is a platform and it evolves slowly over time. Ungraded are fully discussed and tested before being implemented. Bitcoin is the internet of money. It's only ever going to grow and the price will reflect that. Bitcoin is the future. 

So happy halvings day to you this may.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f1xun4/another_halving_explanation_why_the_halving_will/,BadBadgerChef,0,2020-02-10 22:06:22,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f1xun4/another_halving_explanation_why_the_halving_will/,NaN

f201eu,Bitcoin Marketcap Maths,"Assuming there are about 4 millon BTC ""lost forever"" and about 18 million BTC currently mined, we can get a total circulating current amount of about 14 million BTC.

If we divide $100 billion by say 200 million people, we get $500. 

Currently, it would take 200 million people with $500 in BTC per person to build a 5 trillion BTC marketcap.

It's equally easy to understand that people from the network want to have privacy on financials, nevertheless, privacy must not be confused with secrecy. 

As such, instead of just positioning ourselves against the system, why don't we start breaking these arguments by promoting/developing/launching tools that help preventing black money &amp; laundry?

f2eqjj,Anti-money laundry or black money tools and practices as a way to promote Bitcoin?,"^(To moderators: if you remove this, please, just let me know why, so that I can learn.) 

One of the constant criticism from regulators / agencies towards Bitcoin is the difficulties to prevent money laundry or black money to be within the bitcoin network.

It's easy to understand that this is one of the fallacies against the adoption of a new standard that has potential to rival with the current financial system. It's equally easy to understand that people from the network want to have privacy on financials, nevertheless, privacy must not be confused with secrecy.

As such, instead of just positioning ourselves against the system, why don't we start breaking these arguments by promoting/developing/launching tools that help preventing black money &amp; laundry?

Big investors always think to put money into something and then, eventually, taking it out. And by increasing cleanliness of the network it could unblock a considerable flow of money into Bitcoin, as real people and big investors would find it safer that the regulators would not forbid it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f2eqjj/antimoney_laundry_or_black_money_tools_and/,lifeaser,1,2020-02-11 20:48:10,11,/r/Bitcoin/comments/f2eqjj/antimoney_laundry_or_black_money_tools_and/,NaN
