2021-03-26,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed Tuesday that you can now purchase a Tesla vehicle in the U.S. using bitcoin.

The American auto and clean energy company has set up an entire bitcoin support page on its website to help guide prospective car buyers on how to pay using the increasingly popular cryptocurrency.

To pay with bitcoin, all you need to do is “initiate payment from your bitcoin wallet.” You can either scan the QR code, or copy and paste the bitcoin address and the exact amount into your wallet, according to Tesla’s website.

Musk also disclosed on Twitter that people outside of the U.S. will be able to buy Tesla vehicles using bitcoin “later this year.”

Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2021

Tesla made headlines just last month by investing $1.5 billion in bitcoin, while announcing in its recent SEC filing plans to accept it as a form of payment “in the near future.” Well, the future came sooner than expected.

Bitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency and the first to be widely adopted, according to Coinbase. Its current market capitalization (total value) is $996.8 billion, coming in at just under a $1 trillion, according to real-time data tracked by CoinMarketCap.

To invest, you don’t have to buy one entire bitcoin, you can buy just a fraction. One bitcoin is currently worth over $51,000.

For starters, you need to sign up for a platform that allows you to purchase and exchange cryptocurrency.

Here are some options to get you started:

Overstock also accepts bitcoin as a form of payment. It became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin in 2014, according to a report by CoinDesk.

The online retailer partnered with Coinbase to enable bitcoin as a form of payment. For more information, check out Overstock’s help page here.

Overstock also has a “Bitcoin Bestsellers” page, which is what their customers “love to buy with Bitcoin.”

The following categories are a part of Overstock’s “Bitcoin Bestsellers”:

Tell us. nj.com/tips","Vehicle manufacturing behemoth General Motors is being tipped as the likely car producer to follow in the footsteps of Tesla and accept Bitcoin as payment.

It is understood the 113-year-old company has been seeking out customer feedback on using cryptocurrency as a method of full or part payment.

Elon Musk made a surprise – but not altogether unexpected – announcement earlier this week with a simple tweet which read “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin”.

Only weeks ago, the 18-year-old motor manufacturer moved $1.5 billion of its value into Bitcoin, as entrepreneur Musk repeatedly broadcast his admiration for the original cryptocurrency alongside shows of faith for altcoin Doge.

While Musk’s worship of digital assets has been on public display for some time, it now appears that another motoring giant has been keeping its crypto connections close to its chest.

Detroit-based General Motors has, it is believed, been investigating the possibility of what future vehicle finance may look like – including the prospect of cryptocurrency.

Dismissed and embraced

Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra appeared to have both dismissed and embraced the notion.

“We don’t have any plans to invest in Bitcoin, so full stop there,” she said during a conference.

“This is something we’ll monitor, and we’ll evaluate, and if there’s strong customer demand for it in the future, there’s nothing that precludes us from doing that.”

Numerous analysts, though, are of the opinion that Barra was simply being guarded about behind-the-scenes work.

After all, General Motors was one of the first manufacturers to set foot in the space when it invested heavily in blockchain – the technology which underpins cryptocurrency – more than two years ago.

The firm, once the largest motoring manufacturer in the world, began patenting blockchain uses for driverless vehicles and personal security data.

GM bosses also announced a partnership with blockchain specialists Spring Labs in 2019.

If and when General Motors do declare a potential foray into crypto, it’s unlikely they’ll mirror Elon Musk’s style of announcement by breaking the news on Twitter.

Bitcoin had been on a declining pattern until Wednesday morning, but his tweet gave the 12-year-old cryptocurrency a jolt back up from being perilously close to falling below $50,000. The rally, however, was short lived and Bitcoin fell back onto its haunches within 24 hours.

Yesterday it found itself precariously looming under $51,000, but a morning rally today has propelled it back up above $53,000.","Bitcoin 101: Could Cryptocurrencies Eventually Replace the Dollar?

Billionaires had been dismissing it since inception; however, in the last few months, many are coming to accept that Bitcoin will be around in the future.

So, Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin. It started as this pesty idea that hit us like a fly on a hot summer day. As the last few years have gone by, the fly keeps buzzing louder and louder and just won’t go away. Billionaires had been dismissing it since inception; however, in the last few months, many are coming to accept that it will be around in the future. Even companies like PayPal, Tesla and Square are starting to accept Bitcoin. So, what is it? What are the pros and cons of it? Will it ever replace the dollar as the world’s currency?

What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was created by a mysterious person named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. This is an alias, and nobody knows for sure who he is. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or digital asset, meaning you cannot tangibly hold it. It exists through the internet using a technology called blockchain, which uses computers to keep a growing list of transactions. There is no central computer or server that monitors this, meaning it is decentralized. For many pro-Bitcoin people, this concept is one of the central reasons they like cryptocurrencies. There are only 21 million Bitcoins with close to 18.5 million in circulation and two million that are left to be “mined” (we won’t go into that here).

One of the arguments for Bitcoin is that there is only a finite amount of them, meaning you cannot scale during times of financial crises and governments cannot manipulate them. That is one of the main reasons that the anti-cryptocurrency crowd is so down on its mainstream use. However, there are other cryptocurrencies that have the functionality to create more coins. So why should Bitcoin be “the chosen cryptocurrency?” Because it was first?

Taxation of Bitcoin

As of today, Bitcoin is almost fully used as a speculative investment and not as a currency. Very few companies allow Bitcoin to be used as a currency in exchange for goods. The IRS has deemed Bitcoin as property, meaning that you are supposed to pay taxes when you sell your Bitcoin or exchange it. An example would be if Tesla started to accept Bitcoin as payment. Let’s say you’re buying a Tesla for $80,000, and you are going to use $30,000 in cash and a Bitcoin valued today at $50,000 to purchase it. If you had bought that Bitcoin at $10,000, you now owe taxes on that $40,000 gain! This makes Bitcoin very unfriendly to use as a currency and one of a list of reasons it will not replace the dollar in the short term.

A Regulation Nightmare

Without a centralized way to protect cryptocurrencies from being stolen or hacked, consumers will not have the confidence in exchanging their U.S. dollars for Bitcoin. There is no FDIC insurance for Bitcoin and nothing that guarantees your Bitcoin against theft. So far, over three million out of the 18.5 million Bitcoins in circulation cannot be accounted for. Without the ability to see all transactions and where they are coming from, it creates tremendous risk of money laundering as well. This would allow for terrorist funding and drug trafficking. The block ledger uses “codes” to name buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. Many believe a tremendous amount of Bitcoin transactions to date come from illegal money movement and the government’s inability to track money flows. The IRS has a hard time collecting taxes on these gains as most of the cryptocurrency exchanges do not report cost basis.

Conversely, the whole mantra of the cryptocurrency world is that there is no central government distorting the money supply, as well no central computer system to monitor Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Pro-cryptocurrency people believe that regulation will stifle innovation, manipulate the cryptocurrencies and will create black markets making Bitcoin even harder to stabilize. So, support from the likes of the exchanges has not been ideal for the government or regulators. Will the United States ever support a currency that it cannot track?

Where Do We Go Next?

Over the past month, a new type of “online ownership”—known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which use the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin—has become the latest hot topic Works of “digital art” are selling for millions and millions of dollars. Keep in mind when buying NFTs with cryptocurrency, you are required to pay the taxes on the gain of the cryptocurrency—another regulation nightmare and a way for criminals to try to launder gains. Will there be a world currency at some point in time that uses a blockchain? Possibly, just not sure it would be Bitcoin.

The other thing to consider is the amount of carbon emissions used in Bitcoin mining is dramatic (again, we won’t go in depth here on why). So, there are a lot of hurdles in the way of this concept going mainstream, especially with a big push to stop carbon emissions. Where we go from here is anyone’s guess. Will this be the next Tulip mania or will this be the new gold of the 21st century? Only time will tell.

Regulators and central banks may not like it, but Bitcoin’s recent trillion-dollar market valuation and Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin have made big headlines in 2021. As the biggest single investor by far, Elon Musk has joined a global army of Bitcoin holders which is now estimated at 30 million worldwide.

These investors have been attracted by Bitcoin’s sharp price rise and the accompanying blitz of media coverage about it. However, while Bitcoin may have been the first cryptocurrency (and is now the most famous and valuable), the use of others such as Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin is rapidly growing too. All of these are built on blockchain, or distributed ledger technology (DLT).

However, despite increased appetite to invest in cryptocurrencies and increasing institutional acceptance, such as JP Morgan’s newly announced “Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket”, cryptocurrencies are still regarded as highly volatile and controversial. This is in large part due to their opaque ownership structure, which is inherent in investments underpinned by DLT.

Lack of transparency and regulation paving the way for crypto-fraud

Governments and regulators are keen to support the use and expansion of DLT as it has many potential applications, including the secure sharing of medical data, cross-border payments, supply chain and logistics monitoring, real estate processing and voting mechanisms.

Central banks are also looking at future opportunities for digital currencies which they issue and regulate (CBDCs). The Bank for International Settlements and seven central banks have published a report laying out the key requirements for CBDCs, indicating that they consider that CBDCs have real potential to operate as an alternative to fiat (paper) currencies, which at present give these banks control over how much money is printed and in circulation.

Governments and regulators are keen to support the use and expansion of DLT.

However, there remains a lack of regulation in this space on a global level. Current regulatory powers are insufficient to control how crypto asset companies conduct their business and how cryptocurrencies are used in society, providing opportunities for misuse by fraudsters and criminals.

The lack of transparency is also a major concern. Without being subject to either government or central bank control, the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently detailed the use of cryptocurrencies in both terrorist financing and money laundering. Meanwhile the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said that Bitcoin has been involved in “some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.” In the UK, there has been some reluctance to regulate crypto-assets in the same way as other jurisdictions (such a Gibraltar, which claimed to be the first jurisdiction to introduce a regulatory framework for DLT). However, the FCA’s announcement that from 10 January 2021 all crypto-asset businesses carrying on activity in the UK must be registered indicates that change is coming.

Another principal concern is crypto fraud. Among the most high profile global crypto frauds to date are cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes, for example PlusToken (which defrauded investors out of approximately $2.9 billion via an exit scam) and WoToken (which operated a similar scheme, and netted over $1 billion for the fraudsters). Other forms of crypto fraud include hacking, unregulated or fake brokers and wholesale fraudulent crypto-currency exchange platforms. In 2020 in the UK alone, around £113 million was lost as a result of fraudulent cryptocurrency investments with a further £14.3 million lost in January 2021.

How are the English courts dealing with novel issues arising out of cryptocurrency litigation?

The English courts are seeing an increase in litigation involving cryptocurrencies, and this is a trend that we expect to continue. This requires the courts to deal with some novel legal issues. Usefully, the English courts have a range of interim and enforcement powers at their disposal, which they are deploying to assist claimants in recovering crypto-assets lost to fraud. For example, the High Court has followed the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce’s statement that crypto-assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are property, and has granted proprietary injunctions to prevent further dealing whilst proceedings are ongoing (see AA v Persons Unknown [2019] EWHC 3556 (Comm)).

Further, the Commercial Court in London recently heard its first initial coin offering (ICO) fraud case: Ion Science Limited & Duncan Johns v Persons Unknown unreported), 21 December 2020 (Commercial Court) ICO’s are essentially the crypto-equivalent of IPOs, and in this case the fraudster induced the applicants to transfer Bitcoin in the belief that they were investing in legitimate crypto-assets. Again, the court held that crypto-assets were property under common law and granted proprietary injunctions in favour of the applicants.

The judgment is significant as the applicants required permission to serve out of the jurisdiction against persons unknown. The court found that the lex situs (i.e. where the property was located) was the place where the person or company owning the crypto-asset is domiciled.

Importantly in Ion Science, the Court also granted permission to serve disclosure orders (Bankers Trust orders) on two cryptocurrency exchanges through which the applicant’s stolen Bitcoin had been traced. The decision marked a sea change from earlier authorities, as the exchanges in question were located outside of the jurisdiction of England and Wales. This decision, together with the powers of the court of England and Wales to order proprietary injunctions with respect to crypto-assets, makes the jurisdiction an attractive forum for potential claimants.

What does the future hold?

Market expectation is that the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets will continue to grow. It is not hard to see that the increased trading and holding of crypto-assets will likely lead to more crypto-related disputes. Looking forward to the next decade, we anticipate that crypto-asset claims will dominate fraud litigation in the English courts.

Encouragingly, the English court is taking a proactive role in the global fight against cyber and cryptocurrency fraud. Its willingness to adapt its traditional weapons for use in this developing area demonstrates that it is an effective forum in which to bring actions involving crypto-assets. As ICO and crypto-related disputes continue to increase, so too will the use of interim injunctions to further factual investigations and to protect assets underpinning the litigation. The AA v Persons Unknown and Ion Science judgments are likely to act as a blueprint for future claims and, in a similar vein, we should expect to see more innovative use of weapons in the Court’s toolkit against fraud.

People have started trusting the internet upto an extent that they are ready to invest in it too.

Although a number of attempts have already been made before the year 2008, none of them succeeded. People tried many times but didn’t make it to the end. For example B-Money and Bit-Gold never made to the market.This was in 2008, when the Bitcoin digital currency was introduced.

As soon as Bitcoin was launched it started gaining a huge fame and popularity. The following paper will reveal some of the milestones of the Bitcoin digital currency.

The Year 2008 and Mr.Nakamoto, A Mystery:

Back in the year 2008, a paper titled: Bitcoin-Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was sent to the authorities of the cryptocurrencies discussion. This paper was the first thing that came from the developers of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. This paper was sent by a team or individual calling themselves as santoshi nakamoto. The most astonishing thing about the publisher is that their identity is still a mystery and they are totally anonymous till date. This paper contains everything about the concept and working of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network. It was the base of the future cryptocurrency called the Bitcoin digital currency.

2009 and The Launch of the Bitcoin

The amazing cryptocurrency called the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was made available for the public use in the start of the Year 2009. the software of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was very easy to use and that was a major reason why It gained a lot of popularity among the public in a very short duration of time.

In the month of January 2009 the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was launched for the first time and in the same month the first transaction around the Bitcoin currency was made successfully. As soon as the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was launched the mining of the Bitcoin started as well . The year 2009 was pretty dope for the development and success of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Year 2010-Bitcoin Worth

In the 2010 debate, going pro currency started gaining more attention. As we mentioned that Bitcoin cryptocurrency was mined in the year 2009. However the first trading at the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was made in 2010 after the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was valued for the very first time. Back then people were not aware of the value and the upcoming future of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. That’s why they swap the Bitcoin cryptocurrency without knowing the actual future of it.

If they had the Bitcoins right now they could easily make $100000000 out of it pretty easily. Well we all know that this is the part of every product and its journey.

2011-Rivals

In the year 2011 many other digital currencies started emerging as a competition with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The examples include Namecoin, Litecoin etc. Although there are many hundreds of digital currencies that are being circulated in the trading market right now but none of them gain as much popularity as the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

2017- The Bitcoins Killing The game

As time was passing by the amount to popularity gained by the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was also increasing. a large number of companies and other organisations started dealing with the Bitcoin cryptocurrencies and started accepting payments in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. With the increasing Fame and popularity the rate and the created value of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency also started to rise. In the year 2017, Bitcoin reached a point that was never seen before in the history of the digital currency. It gained a price of 10,000 US dollars which was a big thing for a currency launched recently.

Although the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was launched by a developer who is still anonymous , irrespective of this fact the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has gained a lot of success among its users and has won their trust. By the end of the year, there were many exchanges that had been launched, and it was one of the most searched topics in the world. In countries like Denmark, there was a lot of competition and traffic in Danish websites about buying, selling and investing in Bitcoin. After December of 2017, Bitcoin had one of the biggest crashes ever seen. It went all the way from nearly $20,000 USD to an average of $6,000 USD per coin.

Year 2020 – A break through

Although the Bitcoin cryptocurrency stays unaffected by all the convention factors that affect the local currency, it still gets affected by them to some extent. As we all know, every year 2020 has been pretty unexpected due to covid-19 pandemic. The finance market of the whole universe has crashed to a great extent but if we see the Bitcoin cryptocurrency we will observe that it has raised its value to a great extent in the year 2020. Bitcoin digital currency has gained record-breaking success in the last year. By the end of the year 2020 Bitcoin was at a price that was never seen before.

Summing Up

Whatever you think or say about the Bitcoin cryptocurrency but you can never deny the popularity and trust it has gained in such a short duration of time. The thing that has benefited the Bitcoin to the currency most is the fact that it was in a totally decentralized manner. The Bitcoin cryptocurrency is not in the control of any Bank or government. It works in a totally independent manner. You can trade as well as invest in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency the following summary simple steps. like everything Bitcoin currency has also its drawbacks but it all depends on the users and his strategy. If you want to play with Bitcoin cryptocurrency you have to be pretty careful so that you can avoid any unexpected unfortunate circumstances.","Here’s a rundown of the significant developments and events that happened across the crypto-verse this week

The list of Bitcoin ETF applicants continues to grow

More firms submitted their Bitcoin ETF applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Scaramucci-led SkyBridge Capital, in conjunction with First Advisors, made a joint application earlier this week to have their ETF product accepted. The filing details that the former will be ETF sub-advisor while the latter serves as the advisor of the product.

The two were joined by giant financial service corporation Fidelity Investment which announced on Wednesday that it was looking to launch its Bitcoin ETF product. Fidelity filed an application that would see the Fidelity subsidiary FD Funds Management introduce an ETF product called the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.

The ETF will hold Bitcoin and its share value determined using the Fidelity Bitcoin Index. The fund will technically track the price of the leading crypto from major crypto exchanges in the US. This latest bunch of Bitcoin ETF applications come barely a week after Goldman Sachs revealed it was planning to debut its Bitcoin ETF product.

Meanwhile, crypto analysts believe it won’t take long before the regulator starts approving some of the applications since the US lags behind countries like Brazil and Canada. Bitcoin ETF products outside the US have proved to be a success, and US firms are seemingly becoming impatient with the commission that has, so far, been hesitant to emulate other countries.

XRP bounces back with users pushing for the relisting of the asset

A “RelistXRP” campaign was the town’s talk on Monday after the hashtag trended on social media platforms in different regions. Calls to relist the asset were prevalent on socials in the US, Australia, and European countries like the UK. XRP has suffered immense losses since its parent company Ripple got into legal troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The crypto token is still a bone of contention as both parties struggle to reach an agreement regarding its status. However, this week, XRP received an early boost, rallying to a daily high of around $0.60 on Tuesday. It retraced back to $0.54, where it remained for the larger part of Wednesday. A sharp descent saw its price briefly drop to $0.477 and then $0.43 on Thursday. The crypto asset is currently on an uptrend, having rallied to $0.54 earlier today.

Elsewhere, Ripple executives have claimed that XRP can be tapped to act as the link between different digital currencies currently lacking interoperability. In a paper titled ‘The Future of CBDCs,’ the company explains that while digital currencies are crucial to the fiat system’s survival, they have several differences stemming from their design and differences. These differences make it hard for them to settle cross-border payments – a limitation that the introduction of XRP into the picture would overcome.

Boston Fed and MIT making huge steps in the development of CBDC

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston have made considerable progress on digital currency. The group has worked together for almost a year and will be looking to have digital dollar prototypes launched somewhere in July.

According to the project leader, James Cunha, the launch will feature two platforms designed to handle transactions involving the digital dollar. It is unknown if the platforms will be based on blockchain. Cunha added that interested third-parties will be allowed to develop the code even further upon unveiling the prototypes.

Many banks are still opposed to the idea of a digital dollar because they stand to lose the most should it be successfully implemented. On the other end of the spectrum, payment services like Visa and MasterCard appear to have embraced digital currencies. The services have even moved to collaborate with central banks on the same.

Bitcoin surges upon news of Tesla accepting BTC payments

Bitcoin’s correction this week has deepened with the asset struggling to stay above $50,000. The leading crypto started the week fairly, notching a price figure above $58k on Monday before a tumble to $53k less than 36 hours later. Bitcoin climbed back to $54k early on Wednesday before pushing to $57k later during the day amid positive Tesla news.

The Chief Executive of the EV automaker, Elon Musk, announced through a tweet that it was now accepting Bitcoin as payment for EV purchases. Musk went on to clarify that the Bitcoin payments upon being received will not be converted. Instead, they will be retained as Bitcoin. However, this option is only available to US citizens at the moment.

The announcement was not really a surprise to many as Tesla had previously hinted it would add crypto support without mentioning a specific date. Several users noted the BTC payment option in the company’s US stores prompting the chief executive to make it official. The company also revealed it was working to make the option available to those outside the US borders.

FCA study details worrying findings of young people investing in crypto

A report conducted by the UK Financial Conduct Authority has shown young people are increasingly becoming invested in crypto. The study further revealed that while the interest was growing, most young people invest in crypto assets for the wrong reasons.

The financial watchdog concluded that the younger generation was getting involved in crypto for the thrill they derive. The young people are said only to want to experience a sense of ownership which is why they are after having stakes in companies. The FCA report additionally stated that young investors could not handle losses that are a common outcome in the turbulent crypto sector.

Another worrying revelation was that most young people perceived crypto investment as a competition that is in stark contrast to the ‘actual’ objective of securing a future. The regulatory body advised that young people understand the risks associated with high return investment products like crypto before diving into them.","Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio recently made a case that the US government could ban Bitcoin in the country if deemed necessary

A Bitcoin ban in the US is not a far-fetched notion in the opinion of billionaire Ray Dalio. The hedge fund manager is convinced there is a good probability that the US outlaws Bitcoin. Dalio, who is the chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, the biggest investment hedge fund in the US, shared his thoughts on the future of the flagship crypto while speaking in an episode of Influencers with Andy Serwer.

He referenced the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 when the US government, at the time, banned private possession of Gold in an attempt to secure its monetary system. The Act, as he explained, was implemented to prevent Gold from competing with fiat money as a wealth standard.

Dalio likened the case to the probable outlawing of Bitcoin (which has flourished even as the dollar and other traditional assets struggle) if need be. The billionaire investor explained that central banks love controlling the supply and demand waves in their country in a monopolistic fashion. He added that these banks might feel threatened by other forms of money like digital assets as they tend to create a demand and supply they can’t control.

“Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand,” he said. “They don’t want other monies to be operating or competing because things can get out of control. So I think that it would be very likely that you will have it under a certain set of circumstances outlawed the way Gold was outlawed.”

The Bridgewater Associates chief drew attention to India’s current situation where the government is weighing up the option to ban cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It has barely been three weeks since India’s Finance Minister made remarks on the country’s stance on crypto, asserting that there was only a window to experiment with crypto assets.

Dalio argued that a government ban would mean a slump in demand. The hedge fund manager remained sceptical that privacy of the crypto asset could be guaranteed while conceding that he was not savvy of bitcoin and its underlying technology.

“Now, can they do it? Yeah. Now we get into the particulars. My understanding from people who are sort of in government surveillance is yes, they can understand they can track it. They can know who’s dealing with it. I don’t know, like, I’m not an expert on that. But, you know, there’s a whole way, is it private wallets? Is it not private wallets?”","Here’s some free advice for the Honda Motor Company: Market your cars to the newly bitcoin rich.

OK, so I’m no Don Draper. It’s doubtful Honda or any other affordable carmaker would heed my suggestion any time soon. It’s different for luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla, which doesn’t need to be told – it’s already doing something similar.

Diamond hands

This week, the manufacturer began accepting bitcoin (BTC) as payment for its cars, delivering on a promise made in early February by its impish chief executive, Elon Musk. Underscoring his faith in the currency, Musk declared on Wednesday that Tesla would keep rather than convert any bitcoin it earns from car sales.

Typically, the rare merchant that accepts crypto as payment for goods or services will swap it right away for U.S. dollars or another fiat currency. That’s understandable, given the price volatility and the low likelihood that a merchant’s suppliers would take magic internet money. But the Tesla chief said his company is HODLing.

For the uninitiated, HODLing is bitcoin slang for refusing to sell BTC, either to take profits in a bull market or to cut losses in a bear market. Based on a forum poster’s drunken misspelling of “hold,” the word broadly connotes a steely determination in the face of fear, uncertainty and doubt. A HODLer is someone who, to borrow from Rudyard Kipling, “can keep your head when all about you/Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.”

Not Satoshi Nakamoto (Creative Commons)

Musk clearly is one, in at least the narrow sense, having invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin for Tesla’s corporate treasury beginning this year. Over the last 12 months, the cryptocurrency’s price has soared nearly 700%, as inflation fears, a self-perpetuating hype cycle and possibly pandemic lockdown boredom spurred buying among individual and institutional investors. Like Tesla, for instance.

Yet, while I’m sure Musk would be happy to keep growing Tesla’s BTC stash one car sale at a time, I strongly suspect that isn’t his only or main motivation.

Rather, my gut is that the payment option is at least in part, if not primarily, a clever marketing maneuver.

Incentives to HODL

First off, there’s no indication Tesla is offering a discount to buyers who pay with bitcoin, which you might expect the company to do if its main goal were to acquire more of the stuff. Also, Tesla surely understands bitcoiners are strongly disincentivized to part with their “sats” (a loving nickname for the currency’s smallest unit, 0.00000001 BTC, in homage to creator, Satoshi Nakamoto).

This is partly for the reason I alluded to in my quixotic Honda pitch: Bitcoin is deflationary by design. There’s a set amount – 21 million BTC – that will ever be minted. Yet, as it grows in popularity, denominating things such as luxury cars in bitcoin ends up hurting the buyer over the long run.

While the price oscillates wildly from one minute to the next, if you zoom out the lens real wide, bitcoin has generally appreciated over time, which encourages saving (or “hoarding,” depending on your worldview). Remember that pizza purchased for 10,000 bitcoin in 2010? Ten thousand bitcoin is worth $500 million today. Hope the pizza tasted good.

Also, in the U.S. crypto is treated as property for tax purposes, which means that if you buy a coin for, say, $1 and it doubles in value and you spend that extra dollar on a cup of coffee, you are supposed to report the purchase to the Internal Revenue Service and pay tax on it. It remains to be seen whether Uncle Sam will go after every last Joe Schmoe who fails to report a piddling purchase. But it’s reasonable to assume anyone who uses crypto gains to buy a Tesla (which can run from $39,000 to $150,000) would show up on the taxman’s radar.

Even if a buyer can overcome those hurdles, Tesla isn’t making it easy. As CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn reported Thursday, when paying Tesla with bitcoin, a car buyer has “about 30 minutes” to complete the transaction or else the price in BTC expires and a new one must be requested. Also, Tesla will only accept exact amounts and will not reimburse payments sent to an incorrect address.

All told, even if you have large bags of bitcoin, it may make more sense to pay with fiat, whether for a Tesla or a tall latte.

Tribal signaling

Crypto is already obsessed with a car: the Lamborghini. But it’s more of a joke than anything. Were Tesla to become the true status symbol in this industry, it could move the needle.

By embracing bitcoiner culture, Musk is likely to make more sales among that crowd than would happen otherwise, even if they’re settled in greenbacks. Any extra bitcoin Tesla picks up would be gravy.

In the Wednesday tweet, Musk also revealed Tesla is running its own node, rather than relying on a third party to tell it what’s happening on the Bitcoin network. This is considered a best practice for advanced users, but it’s also a signal to the tribe: I get it. I’m one of you. It’s closely associating the Tesla brand, and Musk’s, with the ethos of the sovereign individual that animates the crypto community, not least of all the bitcoin faithful.

The absolute madman (NORAD and USNORTHCOM Public Affairs)

Think of it as a weird 21st century twist on affinity marketing, but without any formal partnership like the one my college had with a credit card lender in the 1990s, which led to me getting up to my ears in debt from charging stuff I didn’t need and couldn’t afford. Gee thanks, alma mater; I wish bitcoin were around back then to set me straight.

There is also a less charitable interpretation of Musk’s messaging: That he’s trying to divert attention away from bad news for Tesla. As CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported in February, the big coming-out party coincided with the revelation by Chinese officials that they were questioning Tesla about quality and safety issues. And this week’s bitcoin announcement conveniently happened right after reports that U.S. regulators are scrutinizing Tesla’s autopilot technology.

If true, this explanation is not mutually exclusive with my hunch. Tesla HODLing bitcoin could be a cynical PR move and a marketing coup – and a sincere adoption of an innovation in the world of bits by an innovator in the world of atoms, all at the same time. Binary thinking is for fools.

It’s far from certain if the marketing ploy, if that’s what it is, will work. “Not quite sure if anything sold yet in bitcoin,” a Tesla representative told my colleague Thursday.

But for my money, it’s better than anything Madison Avenue could come up with.",
2021-03-27,"Crypto Markets Rebound, Bitcoin Price Consolidates, BTC Dominance Levels Sink

The price of bitcoin dropped around 8% during the last seven days, but prices started to improve during Friday’s mid-afternoon trading sessions. Today, bitcoin is swapping for prices between $54,400 to $54,800 per unit and commands a $1.02 trillion market valuation. The overall market capitalization of all 8,500+ coins in existence is around $1.59 trillion on Saturday morning.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices have seen some improvements after the price slid from $57,207 to a low of $50,360 on Thursday. BTC is up today over 3%, but down 5% for the week on March 27, 2021. Bitcoin dominance among all the other coin valuations combined is around 59.3% while ethereum (ETH) captures 11%.

Bitcoin is still up over 16% for the month, 109% during the last three months, and 763% against the USD for the year.

The top trading pair with bitcoin (BTC) today is tether (USDT) which commands 55% of the crypto asset’s trades. This is followed by USD (16.85%), BUSD (5.92%), JPY (4.19%), EUR (3.84%), and the KRW (2.38%).

This week the cryptocurrency community was pleased to hear that Elon Musk revealed that the electric car company Tesla will now accept BTC for purchases. The CEO of Zumo, a digital wallet and payments platform, Nick Jones believes more brands will join Tesla’s lead.

“We’re delighted to see that Tesla is now accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for their products,” Jones explained. “The increased institutional investment and market support of cryptocurrency from such brands is a key indicator of not only its long-term value but its contemporary relevance. Knowing that over half of UK crypto owners have purchased this currency in the last six months, I’d imagine that more brands will follow suit,” the Zumo CEO added.

At the time of publication, the second largest crypto asset by market cap, ethereum (ETH) is trading for $1,686 per unit and is up over 3% today. Behind ETH is tether and in the fourth market position binance coin (BNB) is trading for $254, up 2.5% over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin cash (BCH) is in the 11th market position today and exchanging hands for $495 per BCH. The crypto asset is up 0.64% today, down 6% for the week, up 0.21% for the last 30 days, and over 48% for the last three months.

The top two gainers today include chatcoin (CHAT) and stakenet (XSN). The top two losers on Saturday morning include selfkey (KEY) and cortex (CTXC).

While banks including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank rush to expand into cryptocurrency services for their clients, firms such as MicroStrategy and Tesla are scooping up BTC worth billions to add to their balance sheets.

Now, speculation is rife that Apple may be next, with Tim Draper including the Cupertino tech giant on his list of firms likely to make a move into crypto. But how likely is it?

BTC As a Store of Wealth

As a tech firm, Apple could find multiple routes into the cryptocurrency markets. One is to emulate Tesla and MicroStrategy and simply add some Bitcoin to its treasury reserves.

The company is one of the most cash-rich among all US companies, with nearly $200 billion in stockpile according to its 2020 fourth-quarter earnings report. However, the general outlook for the greenback isn’t necessarily sunny, given the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic.

Inflationary pressure from massive government debts put Apple’s cash reserves in a precarious position, whereas most analysts believe that the longer-term forecast for Bitcoin is decidedly bullish.

However, a recent report commissioned by eToroX, which provides onboarding solutions for institutions looking to get into cryptocurrencies, puts forward the view that there are other forces at play. Although macroeconomic forces are a consideration, the report surmises:

“Traditional firms are seeking to gain first-mover advantage and/or manage fears of missing out when institutional usage becomes real. An unprecedented long period of quantitative easing around the globe and the COVID-19 pandemic and commensurate response by central banks, on top of the ongoing search for alternative sources of yield, are certainly contributing to strong interest in bitcoin and, subsequently, cryptoassets more widely.”

Putting Crypto in Front of Apple Users

PayPal and Mastercard are just two of the financial giants that have recently made headlines – and helped push crypto prices by incorporating digital assets into their services. Furthermore, there are some parallels between PayPal and Apple here, as both withdrew from the cryptocurrency sector in the early days, with Apple having pulled a blockchain wallet app from the App Store in 2014.

However, recently it started allowing uses to make purchases in Bitcoin using its Apple Pay service, which indicates that the company is no longer averse to incorporating crypto into its offering.

However, RBC Capital Markets’ recent suggestion that Apple should open its own cryptocurrency exchange seems a step too far. According to Bloomberg, analyst Mitch Steves thinks that the company should develop the Apple Wallet into a trading platform for digital assets.

Exchanges or Wallets?

Would Apple really start a crypto exchange? It seems somewhat unlikely. The links to their core product lines of hardware and software are tenuous, offering little opportunity to cross-market. An iOS integrated cryptocurrency wallet seems like a more probable scenario. After all, its biggest rival in the smartphone market, Samsung, has already integrated blockchain into its flagship Galaxy S10 phone.

Samsung recently doubled down on its hardware security with the announcement of its Knox Vault, an isolated, secure environment for the most critical data held on the phone. In the accompanying release, Samsung cites its blockchain wallet as part of the justification for stepping up security. The firm has also previously shared an article explaining why it believes smartphones are best suited to securing blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Therefore, it seems more likely, and closer aligned to Apple’s existing product offering, that an iPhone with an integrated wallet could be on the horizon. Ultimately, Samsung is a closer competitor for the firm than PayPal, so it seems more plausible that it would seek to fend off the competition within its existing lines before making a foray into an entirely new market.

However, perhaps if exchange features are to be included in Apple’s future service offering, it could be via an exchange partner such as PayPal or even Coinbase.

Don’t Expect a Heads-Up

Of course, all of this is speculation, and Apple has plenty of forms when it comes to making high-profile announcements. The firm always plays its cards close to its chest as far as new features are concerned, announcing at one of its regular events.

However, there’s little focus on cryptocurrencies or blockchains in the current speculation, unfortunately.

With regards to the firm spending any of its mammoth cash reserves on BTC, we only need to consider what kind of a price pump would ensue following such an announcement. Therefore, if Apple does buy into Bitcoin, it’s almost a given that we’ll only find out once the company has made its move.","Don’t know your Bitcoin from your blockchain? We’re here to help.

Is there a Bitcoin barrier to entry? For many curious investors yet to dip their toes in the proverbial waters, the biggest thing holding them back may be summed up in one word – knowledge.

The more you try to wrap your brain around the technology behind Bitcoin, the more confused you may be about its actual investment value. How exactly is Bitcoin mined? What is a hard fork? And proof of stake versus proof of concept? Head-scratchers abound.

If we haven’t lost you yet – good! While you may never master the concepts of blockchain and how cryptocurrency is created, in reality, you don’t need to when it comes to investing. All you really need to know is why cryptocurrency has value, how that value compares to traditional currencies and what investing means in the long run.

With platforms like eToro, users can deposit as little as $50 to fund an account, where you can buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, along with a dozen other cryptocurrencies.

So, what makes crypto different than investing in traditional currency, like the US dollar? Here are a few key distinctions.

Finite supply

One of the big issues with investing in the US dollar is inflation, which has been made increasingly evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. As the US dollar weakens at a more rapid rate, with trillions printed by the Federal Reserve, it’s no shock that investors will look to unique ways to diversify their money.

How does inflation affect Bitcoin? In the current context, it doesn’t. That’s because Bitcoin has a finite amount of 21 million coins, so while the value can increase, the maximum amount in circulation cannot. Currently, there are 18.6 billion Bitcoin in circulation, meaning there is still some left to be mined. As a result, many investors look to Bitcoin as a hedge against the damaging effects of inflation.

Store of value

Bitcoin’s finite supply lends to its store of value over time. While gold was the original intrinsic asset, its cumbersome nature led to it being replaced by fiat (i.e., paper) money. A store of value, meanwhile, is an asset that maintains its worth and can be exchanged in the future with no deteriorating value – this can’t be safely said for current physical US currency.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, checks all the major boxes as a strong store of value over time. It has a steady level of scarcity thanks to its finite supply, it is easily divisible (up to eight decimal points), it has growing use as a utility (i.e., form of currency) in transactions, it’s easily transportable through digital wallets, it’s durable as a non-physical currency and it’s nearly impossible to counterfeit, thanks to blockchain encryption technology.

Institutional investment

The problem with Bitcoin’s value in the past is it was mostly driven by retail investment, which ebbed and flowed based on how consumer investors felt about the crypto’s future. In recent months especially, however, major players in tech and financial sectors have either plunked money into Bitcoin or adopted the currency on their platforms.

Companies like MicroStrategy, Square and Tesla have invested huge chunks of capital in Bitcoin, while both traditional (Visa, MasterCard) and modern (PayPal) financial institutions are starting to integrate crypto as a feasible form of currency. The more Bitcoin becomes mainstream, the more legitimate it becomes as a long-term investment.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/chaoss","Local sources inhave commented on why the government may want residents to disclose their digital currency holdings.

Industry professionals in the country have pointed out that the Indian corporate affairs ministry could be looking for disclosures from firms in order to get a clear record of the actual usage of crypto-assets after reports had circulated that certain companies had been paying workers part of their wages in virtual currencies.

As reported by the Indian Express, the nation’s Corporate Affairs Ministry had stated that firms must disclose any crypto holdings or dealings in such assets as part of their financial statements that are regularly submitted to the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

Karunjit Singh and Pranav Mukul have looked into what these new measures might require. They’ve also taken into consideration the Indian government’s stance and suggestion to ban transactions involving “private” cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC). Their comments also considered the Reserve Bank of India or RBI’s ban on these virtual currencies that had been reversed back in March 2020.

While commenting on the nation’s updated regulatory framework, local sources noted that all firms must now disclose in their RoC filings any gains (or losses) made on transactions involving virtual currencies. They must also report the amount of cryptocurrency they might be holding.

Locals are also required to disclose any deposits or advances they’ve gotten from people for the purpose of making investments in crypto-assets.

Industry insiders have stated that these disclosures suggest that the Indian government might be open to adopting a set of regulations for virtual currency transfers instead of completely banning them.

In statements shared with the Indian Express, Shivam Thakaral, CEO at BuyUCoin, remarked:

“This is a major step towards regulating crypto-assets in India and will bring in a lot of transparency in reporting/filing of crypto investments… We are eagerly waiting for positive regulatory guidelines from the Finance Ministry and RBI for more clarity around crypto regulation in India.”

The Times of India reported earlier this month that the government and the RBI actually have a similar approach or stance on cryptocurrencies. There’s a bill that is supposed to be presented in the current session of the Parliament that might bring more clarity to India’s crypto sector.

Sources reportedly told The Times recently that the agencies responsible for supporting the Indian economy are keen to use the underlying tech for cryptos (blockchain or DLT) for settling digital payments. However, Indian authorities have expressed concerns regarding the use of cryptos as a medium-of-exchange or its use to finance illicit activities.

Recently, the RBI cited “major concerns” regarding cryptocurrencies. The central bank governor Shaktikanta Das stated on Thursday (March 25, 2021) that the RBI and the government are “committed to financial stability.”

Das clarified that there’s no different between the reserve bank’s stance and that of the Finance Ministry regarding cryptos.

Das added that “we should await the final decision on the matter” from the Centre.

The governor’s recent statements have come after there was some confusion about what the nation’s stance really is on virtual currencies. After confirming its plans to ban “private’ cryptos, which are criticized for being highly volatile and not being backed by anything, the Indian government appears to have shown some signs that it could accept Bitcoin and other virtual currencies (perhaps as speculative investments but not as legal tender).

Das continued:","You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin — but the IRS will want a cut

The Techno King has spoken.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and billionaire technology enthusiast, announced this week that you can now buy one of his electric vehicles with Bitcoin.

While this may seem like a natural progression for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there’s one catch: the IRS will want a bit of your coin.

Yes, that’s right, cashing in your crypto will cost you. Here, we’ll explain how that works and what you may need to do when you file your taxes this year or next.

How much will the IRS tax my crypto?

adriaticfoto / Shutterstock

In the eyes of the government, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are considered property. Just like stock or bonds and any other type of asset, when you sell and make a capital gain, you owe the IRS a share on your taxes.

Using Bitcoin to purchase goods or services (like a Tesla) is essentially selling your cryptocurrency. If your coin is worth more than when you bought it, you’ve made a profit.

And like any short-term gains, your profit will be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, which ranges from 10% to 37%, depending on your income.

Where you want to be especially careful is when spending bitcoin that’s appreciated enough to push you into a new tax bracket.

Let’s say you have a taxable income of $40,000 before you factor in your Bitcoin sale. You’re now paying a 12% tax rate. If you make another $15,000 from your Bitcoin sale, you’ll move up to the next bracket, increasing your taxes to 22%.

At $40,000, even a $600 increase would bump you up to the next income tax bracket. That’s why it’s important to keep track of changes to tax rates when you wade into investing, whether that be trading on the stock market or buying Bitcoin.

Honestly, we don’t blame you — what a great icebreaker at cocktail parties.

One bitcoin is currently worth $56,000. When we’re talking about moving around that kind of money, we always suggest you consult with a professional financial adviser to ensure you have your ducks in a row when it comes to managing it.

And if you sold off some coin in 2020, you’ll want to be sure to include that in your return when you file your taxes before the May 17 deadline.

How to get trading in crypto

If Musk’s announcement has piqued your interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but you’re not sure how to get started, there are a number of investment apps with low to no commissions that can get you set up.

There is an app that will allow you to do fractional trading, meaning if you can’t afford $56,000 for one Bitcoin, you can buy a small piece of one share. And while you’re at it, you can buy fractional shares of Tesla on the app too.

But don’t forget about your taxes

After you’ve touched base with your financial adviser and started your crypto trading journey, you may start to see higher tax bills.

While there’s not much you can do about how much the IRS can claim from your income, there are other things you can do to offset the extra money owing.","Coming every Saturday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week.

Top Stories This Week

Bitcoin’s price seems to have stalled below $60,000 after surging to all-time highs earlier in March. But on the bright side, Friday’s $6-billion expiration of options — a record-breaking sum — didn’t deliver the slump that some were dreading.

The ever-optimistic PlanB says that we are “nowhere near the end” of the bull run, tweeting: “Bitcoin is just getting started.”

YouTuber and derivatives trader Tone Vays also believes the best is yet to come, telling Cointelegraph: “While it is still possible for Bitcoin to make a lower low for the month in the $48,000 range, I believe we will go up to above $70,000 before June.”

In recent days, BTC plunged to depths of $51,212.85 — the lowest price seen in two weeks. Soon afterward, Michaël van de Poppe warned that BTC needed to regain the $53,200–$53,800 area to revive bullish momentum in the near term, or else more downside was possible. So far this weekend, that threat appears to have been averted.

With tech stocks also taking a hammering at certain points this week, even Elon Musk’s announcement that Tesla now accepts Bitcoin from U.S. customers only delivered a temporary boost to BTC’s price.

The billionaire CEO and “Technoking” said that the electric vehicle manufacturer would hold on to the Bitcoin it accumulates through sales rather than convert it into fiat. He also confirmed that support for crypto payments would be rolled out internationally later this year.

Tesla’s decision to shun “fork products” such as Bitcoin Cash proved calamitous for BCH, which tumbled to new all-time lows against BTC.

But some experts have warned that snapping up a Tesla using crypto might not be a smart move… for now, at least. Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood has urged investors not to use their BTC for purchases until the Internal Revenue Service introduces some more sensible tax policies on crypto assets.

The U.S. currently regards Bitcoin as property rather than currency. This means that irrespective of whether you sell BTC for profit or use it to buy a shiny car, it’s considered to be a taxable event.

It’s now time for our whistle-stop tour of NFT news. You ready? Here goes.

First up, a New York Times reporter got a pleasant surprise when he decided to try and auction off one of his articles as an NFT. Just one day later, it sold for 350 ETH (worth almost $600,000 as of Saturday) — with the proceeds going to charity.

Another big sale came when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold a tokenized representation of his first-ever tweet for more than $2.9 million, also for good causes.

Data from Google Trends suggests that interest in nonfungible tokens has now surged to levels last seen during the ICO craze of 2017. Lego also dropped a hint that it may be getting involved in this flourishing sector after writing a cryptic tweet that said: “Zeros and ones but still a brick.”

Inevitably though, it wasn’t all good news. SEC commissioner Hester Peirce — also known as “Crypto Mom” — has warned that selling fractionalized NFTs could end up breaking the law as this could result in the creation of an investment product.

The crypto-powered esports streaming app Theta announced this week that it was delaying the launch of mainnet 3.0 until June.

In an announcement, the company said that it is still working “to incorporate some building blocks” for a nonfungible token marketplace. This is one of the reasons why a “more thorough code review and testing is required,” prompting the expected launch date to be pushed back from April 21 to June 30.

The network added: “While delays are never ideal, we think this change is the prudent way forward to ensuring a successful mainnet 3.0 launch.”

Investors in Theta took a dim view of the announcement. The token had hit all-time highs of $14.99 on Wednesday, but it fell by more than 25% in the 24 hours that followed.

Forget Tesla CEO — Elon Musk has been promoted. According to a new SEC filing, the billionaire should now be referred to as “Technoking of Tesla.”

His chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, has also been given a promotion… to “Master of Coin.” Both men are going to retain their respective positions.

Musk has reason to celebrate, with figures suggesting that Tesla has been sitting on close to $19 million in unrealized profit per day since announcing its $1.5-billion Bitcoin purchase. This almost eclipses the $721 million in profit it made from selling 500,000 cars in 2020.

The billionaire also waded into the trendy world of nonfungible tokens this week when he announced he was planning to sell a musical NFT, with lyrics based on the hype surrounding the technology — “It’s verified, it’s guaranteed.” Very catchy.

Despite bids exceeding $1.1 million on the Valuables platform, Musk later took his ball home, tweeting: “Actually, doesn’t feel quite right selling this. Will pass.”

What a shame.

Prediction of the Week

Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone believes 2021 marks a watershed moment for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

He says BTC is “well on its way to becoming a global digital reserve asset” and it may be transitioning toward a risk-off asset.

Based on previous behavior, his analysis suggests that prices could peak at $400,000 this year. That eclipses other estimates such as the stock-to-flow model, which calls for an average of $288,000 between now and 2024.

FUD of the Week

Microsoft president Brad Smith has said fintech firms have no business issuing private digital currencies, arguing that money matters should be left to central banks and governments.

Speaking at an online conference organized by the Bank for International Settlements, he said: “I am not a big fan myself of encouraging or asking or wanting us [tech firms] to participate in the issuing of currency.”

The remarks put Microsoft at odds with Facebook, which is continuing to pursue the launch of its Diem stablecoin project. Formerly known as Libra, the project sparked fierce criticism from financial regulators — with many of them warning the digital asset could pose significant risks to the global economy.

An Instagram influencer has been charged with wire fraud after he allegedly scammed followers out of Bitcoin worth $2.5 million.

Jay Mazini — who had close to 1 million followers and was known for “cash giveaways” — is accused of promising victims that he would buy Bitcoin off them at inflated prices. But it’s claimed that, when the crypto was sent, he didn’t transfer the funds as promised.

An FBI official said: “A quick search of the interwebs today will reveal an entirely different image of this multi-million-dollar scammer.”

Mazini is currently being held on state charges in New Jersey and will face New York courts at a later date. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years’ imprisonment.

And we end with a sorry tale that suggests Bitcoin has caused a break-up.

A man on Reddit claims his wife left him after he refused to sell his Bitcoin when prices hit $60,000 — and loaded up on more during the recent dip.

The user, u/Parking_Meater, said his wife packed her bags and has now gone to live with her sister.

He wrote: “She super mad that I didn’t sell at 60k and looks at the price often scolding me. I keep telling her we don’t need the money and have the cash. We live nice. However today she caught me buying the dip and was so pissed she almost hit me!”

Uh oh.

How has the Bitcoin bull run changed crypto media?

The upcoming Berlin update contains EIPs aimed at reducing transaction costs, but it may not provide a long-term solution.","Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) stands as one of the best-performing assets of all time, and the market-leading cryptocurrency has rallied roughly 700% over the last year to hit a price of roughly $54,000 per coin. As impressive as the cryptocurrency's recent gains have been, there are stocks that could significantly outperform Bitcoin from here on out -- and companies fresh off their initial public offerings (IPOs) are a good starting point if you're willing to take on risk in pursuit of explosive gains.

With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to identify an IPO stock that they believe is poised to deliver returns that surpass Bitcoin from here on out. Read on to see why they think PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM), QuantumScape (NYSE:QS), and Coinbase have what it takes to post huge gains.

This advertising innovator could crush the market

Keith Noonan (PubMatic): Digital advertising has played a huge role in shaping the evolution of the internet, and the category still has a huge runway for long-term growth. PubMatic is a programmatic advertising specialist that provides a software platform that helps boost monetization across devices, channels, and ad formats.

People are spending more time online than ever, and it's likely that time spent in digital channels will continue to edge higher and prompt more ad spending to shift to the internet and streaming video distribution. Factor in continued growth for the global population and room for continued ad targeting efficiency and it looks like PubMatic has some very favorable tailwinds at its back.

Programmatic advertising is improving efficiency for both ad purchasers and publishers. Advertisers and agencies get superior returns on their placements and publishers also get better revenue. PubMatic is playing the middleman role, and the business has huge room for expansion so long as it can facilitate this dynamic.

The company managed to grow its sales 64% year over year last quarter while posting a gross profit margin of nearly 80%. Based on the business' recent gross margins, PubMatic should go on to post impressive profits if it continues to expand its sales base.

With a market capitalization of roughly $2.4 billion, the company is still a relatively small player in the digital ad space. However, that should make it easier for the business to grow sales and earnings on a relative basis, and PubMatic's comparatively small size could wind up working to the advantage of investors.

QuantumScape has the potential to be an EV game changer

Jamal Carnette (QuantumScape): Automakers are rapidly planning for a fully electric future. Volkswagen recently announced an ambitious goal that electric vehicles (EVs) as total sales will rise to 70% in Europe and to 50% in the U.S and China by 2030. General Motors also has ambitious plans, with CEO Mary Barra committing to be fully electric by 2035.

There's just one problem: Ultimately, consumers make the decision and not automakers. To attain wide-scale adoption, automakers will need to address consumer concerns about the limitations of EVs, specifically battery technology.

Although the cost to manufacture EV batteries has declined by 90% since 2010, EV batteries are still more expensive than traditional gasoline engines. Other salient concerns are long charging times, total battery life, and poor performance in subzero conditions. These will need to be addressed before we hit the EV-inflection point.

Enter QuantumScape. The company's revolutionary solid-state lithium battery technology is superior to current batteries in every way. The technology allows for smaller and cheaper batteries that charge quicker and will last longer than traditional batteries. Volkswagen is on board in a significant way: It's a major investor, and VW's head of battery technology Frank Blome is on QuantumScape's board.

Sounds great, right? Here's the rub: QuantumScape's revolutionary battery technology will not be available until 2024. Competitors like Panasonic (which currently supplies Tesla's batteries), LG Chem, and China's BYD are using inferior technology but the product is available now.

Admittedly, QuantumScape is for investors with a high risk tolerance and long-term focus. Daily moves greater than 10% will be common and volatility will be significantly higher than the market. Considering we're comparing the company to Bitcoin (and you clicked on the article) it's likely this is understood to be a speculative investment and not the bulk of your investment portfolio.

The exchange titan

Joe Tenebruso (Coinbase): If you're intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin but not yet comfortable with investing directly in cryptocurrencies, consider Coinbase. Investors will soon have the opportunity to own shares in the leading U.S-based cryptocurrency exchange after its upcoming stock market debut.

Coinbase is reportedly planning a direct listing of its stock in the coming weeks. A direct listing enables a company's employees and early investors to sell shares directly to the public, without the need for an investment bank to underwrite the stock sale, as is done with a traditional initial public offering (IPO).

Bitcoin's rising popularity and soaring price have been a boon for Coinbase. The digital asset exchange's revenue more than doubled to $1.3 billion in 2020, fueled by a surge in cryptocurrency trading volumes. Coinbase is also highly profitable, with net income of $322 million last year.

Coinbase's revenue and profits should continue to grow as more institutional and individual investors begin to allocate capital to Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Respected investors such as Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller have recently expressed their bullish views on Bitcoin. In doing so, they've helped to bolster Bitcoin's legitimacy among hedge funds, family offices, and pension funds that collectively manage trillions of dollars of assets.

If these powerful institutional investors decide to allocate just 1% of their capital to the crypto markets, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could soar. And the resulting boom in trading volumes would likely also help to drive Coinbase's revenue and profits significantly higher.","Steven Ehrlich, Director of Research at Forbes Crypto, has suggested that the price of bitcoin could keep on dropping over the next few weeks as rising interest rates are making safer investments more attractive, while bitcoin isn’t behaving as a safe investment itself.

In an interview with Nasdaq Global Markets reporter Jill Malandrino, Ehrlich said that he believes bitcoin’s bull run may be somewhat exhausted as some of the institutional investors that entered the market over the last few months may now be taking profits.

Our Director of Research @Steven_Ehrlich joined @JillMalandrino on @Nasdaq #TradeTalks to discuss if short-term signs of exhaustion are starting to appear with #bitcoin and how investors should approach the #NFT craze: https://t.co/Z6UuEp2yPc — Forbes Crypto (@ForbesCrypto) March 25, 2021

The price of bitcoin, it’s worth noting, moved from $11,000 in October 2020 to a new all-time high near $62,000 this month, before its price corrected to $53,000 according to CryptoCompare data. Since BTC started surging several companies disclosed BTC investments, including Tesla, Square, MicroStrategy, and others.

To Ehrlich, the price of bitcoin may have been recently dropping because of rising interest rates. Per his words, the 10-year T-bill’s rate has hit 1.5% this week, and according to CNBC it has since climbed to 1.64%, making it more interesting to investors with a lower-risk profile.

Per his words, bitcoin is “promoted as a safe-haven asset” but has been moving as a riskier asset, “something akin to growth stocks.” As the economy grows and inflation rises, he said, the Federal Reserve may raise rates further “which could harm bitcoin in the short-term.”

Ehrlich noted that while he is still “very bullish on it” we could see periods of sideways trading and a correction in the near future. Addressing Ethereum, which has outperformed BTC over the last few months, he noted that most decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications are on top of ETH.

He added institutional appetite for ETH has been growing over the last few months and noted that a publicly-traded firm has even invested in ether. As CryptoGlobe reported, earlier this month Hong Kong-listed Chinese firm Meitu has revealed it invested $22.1 million in ether and $17.9 million in bitcoin.

The growing usage of the Ethereum network and the approaching launch of Ethereum 2.0 have also likely been contributing to the cryptocurrency’s growth.

The Bridgewater Associates co-founder and chief investment officer, Ray Dalio, says that there is a good probability that the government will outlaw bitcoin in the same way gold was outlawed in the U.S. in the 1930s.

Ray Dalio Thinks Governments Can Outlaw Bitcoin

Ray Dalio shared his view on whether the government could outlaw bitcoin in an interview with Yahoo Finance Wednesday. He is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund firm. His clients include endowments, governments, foundations, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds.

Dalio believes that bitcoin may suffer a similar fate as gold did in the U.S. during the 1930s. “Like back in the ’30s in the war years … cash and bonds were such bad investments relative to other things, there was the movement to those other things still, and then the government outlawed them … They outlawed gold,” he recalled, elaborating:

That’s why also outlawing bitcoin is a good probability.

Besides outlawing gold, Dalio added that “they also established foreign exchange controls, because they don’t want the money to go elsewhere.”

Emphasizing that “every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don’t want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control,” the Bridgewater founder opined:

So I think that it would be very likely that you will have it, under a certain set of circumstances, outlawed the way gold was outlawed.

“You’re watching that question arise in India today. India today is making a move to outlaw it– outlaw possession of it,” he pointed out. The Indian government is currently working on a cryptocurrency bill and there have been reports that it may ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. However, no official announcement has been made and the crypto industry is hopeful that there will be not an outright ban on cryptocurrencies.

Dalio was also specifically asked if he thinks it is possible for the government to ban bitcoin. He replied: “My understanding from people who are sort of in government surveillance and so on, is, yes, they can understand, they can track it, they can know who’s dealing with it. I don’t know– like, I’m not an expert on that.”

The billionaire hedge fund manager has been learning about bitcoin over the recent months. He admitted in November that he may be wrong about bitcoin but was worried about governments outlawing cryptocurrency. He then said bitcoin “is one hell of an invention” that could “serve as a diversifier to gold and other such storehold of wealth assets.”

Responding to Dalio’s misinformed perspectives, bitcoiners took to social media to argue about the government’s ability to ban bitcoin. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote: “Bitcoin may have similar properties to gold but outlawing decentralized software is a much different problem. It requires you to essentially outlaw the Internet.”

Some people accuse the Bridgewater executive of attempting to manipulate the market to buy cheap coins, noting that a growing number of major corporations are investing in BTC. Recently, Goldman Sachs said it sees huge institutional demand for the cryptocurrency and Visa anticipates bitcoin becoming “extremely mainstream.” Deutsche Bank says bitcoin is now the third-largest currency, after the dollar and the euro. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley is getting ready to offer bitcoin exposure to wealthy clients and other banks are expected to follow suit.

2021-03-28,"Indian Government Now Requires Companies to Disclose Cryptocurrency Holdings

The Indian government has introduced new cryptocurrency disclosure rules. Companies dealing in cryptocurrencies will have to disclose their crypto holdings, among other disclosures, as part of their financial statements beginning April 1.

New Crypto Disclosure Requirements

The Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) issued a notification last week mandating companies to disclose crypto trading and investments during the financial year. These disclosures will be required starting on April 1, which is when India’s financial year 2021-22 begins.

Every company which “has traded or invested in cryptocurrency or virtual currency during the financial year” must disclose “profit or loss on transactions involving cryptocurrency or virtual currency,” “amount of currency held as at the reporting date,” and “deposits or advances from any person for the purpose of trading or investing in cryptocurrency or virtual currency.”

Crypto companies in India welcome the new requirements by the government, believing that it legitimizes cryptocurrency transactions. Monark Modi, founder and CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange Bitex, was quoted by local media as saying:

In light of the recent speculation around ban, allowing cryptocurrencies to be a part of accounting practices will definitely put investors at ease as they no longer have to be worried regarding taxation.

He added: “This is a definite endorsement, and it is good to see that India is not falling behind the global cryptocurrency race. Bringing regulation that provides safety to investors, factors taxation and fosters cryptocurrency as an alternate investment class will be the right step ahead.”

The Indian government is currently finalizing a cryptocurrency bill that was supposed to be introduced during the Budget session of parliament. However, the session has ended and no crypto bill was introduced.

The finance minister has given some clues about what might be in the crypto bill. She said that the government will not shut off all options and will take a calibrated position regarding crypto legislation. Meanwhile, the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), says that it has voiced some major concerns regarding cryptocurrencies to the government. Nonetheless, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das believes that the government and the central bank are in agreement on cryptocurrency.

Indian crypto industry representatives told Decrypt the news is positive but has no bearing on the tabled motion for an outright crypto ban.

While the Indian government mulls a ban on crypto, it’s tightening the screws on existing regulation. The Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs said on Wednesday that all companies incorporated in India must disclose crypto holdings and dealings, effective April 1.

Executives in the Indian crypto industry representatives told Decrypt that the government’s recognition of crypto holdings is a welcome move, though the rule change shouldn’t be interpreted as hope that the government’s tabled motion for a crypto ban is set to fail.

Implications of the ban

In addition to crypto holdings, the new rules, which update the country’s Companies Act of 2013, require companies to disclose the total profit or loss on crypto transactions, as well as any deposits or advances received for crypto trading.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, a crypto exchange that last month recorded trading volumes of $2.3bn, told Decrypt that the new rules indicate that the government is willing to understand the extent and size of the crypto sector. Zakhil Suresh, founder of crypto fantasy trading app SuperStox, explained that the extra scrutiny on crypto holdings is due to Bitcoin’s price, which is now too high to ignore.

Sohail Merchant, CEO of the Indian crypto exchange PocketBits, thinks it shows that India’s government has come a long way. When he started his company in 2016, it took him several months to get approval for registration as the company documents mentioned Bitcoin—something the government didn’t officially acknowledge at the time. But things are different these days: “Regulators now understand the importance of embracing crypto,” he said.

All Quiet on the Ban Front

The issue that looms large remains the prospect of a potential ban on crypto. In late January, the Indian Parliament tabled the “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.”

The bill sought to ban all “private cryptocurrencies”, save for certain unnamed exceptions (“to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”).

That initially fuelled much anxiety across the Indian crypto industry. But the industry representatives told Decrypt earlier this month that they breathed heavy sighs of relief when the finance minister appeared to tone down the government's previous position.

Minister Sitharaman said the government would allow “a window of experiment for crypto,” which they interpreted as a change in tone because he mentioned crypto, not just blockchain.

Since things are so tense, any ministerial statement or any new government directive, such as the new disclosure requirements, are examined for hints about how India’s parliament may vote on the crypto ban.

This one is no different.

Sidharth Sogani, who heads the industry pressure group, the Association for Blockchain, Crypto, told Decrypt the new disclosure rules are nothing special. “It’s basic data collection by the government, and it can go either way,” he said.

But any recognition is better than being totally ignored, said Jagdish Pandya, chairman of Block On Capital, a blockchain advisory company. “While this does not suggest a full-fledged regulation through legislation yet,” he told Decrypt, “such small steps still matter.”","Bitcoin is the word on everyone’s lips, but just how does it work (Picture: Getty)

In March 2021, Bitcoin topped $61,000 (£43,000) for the first time.

Many believe that it could emerge as a mainstream payment method following the Covid-19 pandemic.

Bitcoin – and other cryptocurrency – has become a juggernaut in the financial industry. Some finance wizards, like Elon Musk, believe it has lasting power whereas others, like Bill Gates, have cast doubts.

Regardless of what the future holds, today, just 1 Bitcoin is estimated to be valued at £40,478.

But how do you buy Bitcoin, and how does it all work?

How to buy Bitcoin

The first thing you are going to want to do is alert your bank that your are intending to buy Bitcoin, as if they see the transaction appear out of the blue they may freeze your card.

Then you want to find a marketplace to buy and sell your Bitcoins, you can use sites like Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ETX Capital, Etoro, Plus500, Avatrade or Buy Virtual Currency.

Play the crypto market right and you could make millions with the touch of a few buttons. (Picture: Getty)

These are online Bitcoin wallet sites, and will work as your kind of Bitcoin bank account.

All you have to do is sign up to the site, like you would any other and put in your card details.

Then you will be instructed to buy bitcoins, which you don’t have to do, but you can always immediately sell them back if you change your mind.

Some of these sites will have app versions, but it is recommended that you start up your account online for a smooth starting process.

Or you can just set up your Bitcoin wallet then find a broker.

You can use Bittybot to try to compare brokers, or go for the popular reliable brokers such as Coinify, and Bittylicious.

You will need you Wallet ID to log in to your Bitcoin wallet in the future.

Since Bitcoins are divisible you can buy a really small amount of a Bitcoin.

To actually buy coins from a broker you need your Bitcoin address, and this is a code that can be found in your Bitcoin wallet.

If you want to sell your Bitcoins back you can go back to the same broker who will give you an address to send you Bitcoins to, which you can do from your wallet.

How does Bitcoin work?

Bitcoin is decentralised, which means that no single authority or institution holds or controls the bitcoins.

Regular currency is controlled by one governing authority such as a central bank.

If the country requires more money it can print more money but that devalues the currency and leads to inflation.

Only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created in order to protect the value of the bitcoin system.

Bitcoins can be ‘mined’, which is the process of actually creating Bitcoins, or they can be bought using regular currency.

Bitcoins are made or ‘mined’ by computer power on the Bitcoin network.

Miners use the computer software to follow the mathematical formula to produce Bitcoins.

It’s money for the modern world (Picture: Getty Images)

The mathematical formula is freely available for anyone to check and the software used is open source, meaning anyone can check it.

Bitcoins are not based on gold or federal reserves but on mathematics. Bitcoins are created as a reward for mining, they can be exchanged for other currencies, products or services.

Bitcoins can then be divided into smaller parts – you do not have to buy an entire Bitcoin.

The smallest divisible Bitcoin amount is one hundred millionth and is called a Satoshi after the founder of bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are sent to and from Bitcoin wallets, which is where your Bitcoins are stored electronically.

Bitcoins can be transferred electronically and practically instantly and have historically had low transaction fees, though this is something that has recently changed.

Bitcoin transactions are completely transparent, any Bitcoin transaction can be traced back to the point where the Bitcoins were produced.

Elon Musk has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies online, with a simple Tweet sending the prices of another crypto coin – Dogecoin – soaring. (Picture: Getty)

The ‘the block chain’ is a public ledger where every Bitcoin transaction that ever took place is noted.

However bitcoin is completely anonymous as Bitcoin addresses are not linked to names, addresses, or other personally-identifying information and any one user can hold multiple Bitcoin addresses.

Anyone can see how many Bitcoins are held at a certain address but they don’t know who the address belongs to. Once you have made a transaction using Bitcoins there is no way to get them back unless the recipient returns them.

Each transaction has three pieces of information attached: An input (Bitcoin address that sent the Bitcoins), an amount (amount of Bitcoins being sent), and an output (the recipient’s Bitcoin address).

In a series of tweets, Flood reveals his bullish BTC prediction to his 115,000 followers along with his top altcoin holdings.

The analyst who has been accumulating both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) since 2015 when the assets were worth roughly $250 and $1 each, says that he is heavily invested in BTC and six altcoins going into the second financial quarter of 2021.

“Portfolio by weight going into Quarter close: BTC, FTT (FTX Token), Solana (SOL), Synthetic (SNX), Aave, Raydium (Ray) and ETH.”

The trader adds that he also has decent-sized bags of Ethereum competitor Polkadot (DOT), decentralized exchange Serum (SRM) and automated market maker (AMM) Nerve Finance (NRV).

Of all his altcoin plays, Flood notes that he is particularly bullish on the native token for the FTX crypto derivatives trading platform, FTT and is doing his best to accumulate as much of the asset as possible.

The early crypto adopter feels confident about his bold Bitcoin call, expressing zero doubt that the flagship cryptocurrency will shortly surpass its all-time high of $61,711.

“No reality where BTC doesn’t make a new all-time high next month.”

(Bloomberg) -- India’s monetary policy makers are poised to hold interest rates this week as the economy faces a renewed threat to growth from the pandemic, with new cases hitting a record.All 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the six-member Monetary Policy Committee to keep the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 4% on April 7. Traders will watch for an explicit forward guidance from the Reserve Bank of India on how long the policy stance will stay accommodative and liquidity abundant despite stubborn inflation.Sticky underlying price pressures had earlier stoked expectations of policy normalization amid signs of a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. But those gains could come undone quickly if consumer demand is hit due to curbs on movement, such as those imposed in the capital New Delhi and by the state of Maharashtra, which houses the financial hub of Mumbai and contributes about 15% of the national output.“The current state of affairs will ensure that RBI will not pull back accommodative measures in a hurry,” said Teresa John, economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai, who expects a status quo.Here’s what to watch for in the MPC decision to be announced by Governor Shaktikanta Das in Mumbai on Wednesday morning:Growth ProspectsIn February, the central bank said it expects the economy to expand 10.5% in the year that began April 1 after an estimated 7.7% contraction in the previous 12 months. While Das has indicated there is no immediate threat to that forecast, he could still flag downside risks, given the current surge in virus cases that’s hurting mobility and consumption.Inflation ForecastWith Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government renewing the central bank’s mandate of keeping inflation between 2%-6% for another five years, policy makers are likely to reiterate that fighting price pressures will be a top priority. Fuel and food prices, which make up more than 50% of the consumer price index, represent the biggest problem for rate setters, given their ripple effect on inflationary expectations and underlying price pressures.India is among the few emerging markets in Asia where inflation is above the midpoint of its target band, due largely to food prices that are rising after a brief drop. Economists in a recent Bloomberg survey saw CPI at 5% in the April-June period before easing to 4.7% in the next three months. That compares with the central bank’s forecast of 5%-5.2% for the April to September period.“The risks of increasing input costs, higher commodity prices, seasonal upside in food prices and better pricing power could prod the MPC to relook at its inflation forecasts,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, local lockdowns, if they persist, could impact services demand negatively and put downward pressure on first-quarter core inflation and may act as a balancing factor.”Yield ControlBond investors will be watching on how active the RBI is with its version of yield curve control and how long the accommodative monetary stance lasts.“The market is expecting extended forward guidance in policy stance, from ‘going into next fiscal year’ to say ‘end of calendar year,’” said Naveen Singh, head of fixed income at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai.The bond market is facing another year of near record supply amid weak appetite for debt. Benchmark yields rose 30 basis points last quarter, the most since 2018 amid a sharp spike in U.S. yields and crude prices. Governor Das has assured investors that RBI will help ease the supply burden by purchasing at least 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion) of bonds through open market purchases, or OMOs, and more durable cash injection to compensate for the withdrawal of a relaxation in a cash reserve ratio.“We expect the RBI to reiterate that surplus liquidity will remain ample to support growth and that the space created by CRR reversal will be offset by OMO purchases of bonds to help bridge the gap between demand-supply of bonds and prevent longer-end bond yields from shooting up excessively in a short period of time,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG.(updates survey details in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","An IT security researcher has been able to adapt Nintendo’s first major handheld game console to mine cryptocurrency.

According to a recent YouTube video, user Stacksmashing used the hardware from a Nintendo Game Boy first released in 1989 as a starting point to mine Bitcoin (BTC). Because the gaming console has no built-in wireless capabilities — and largely predates the internet — the YouTuber said he used a Raspberry Pi microcontroller board attached to the Game Boy’s link port and a USB flash card to establish a connection to a BTC node run from his computer.

""My goal was to use an original, unmodified Game Boy,"" said Stacksmashing. ""I want to plug in a cartridge and start mining.""

Stacksmashing wrote his own mining code for the Game Boy’s read-only memory, integrated mining software — modified for the gaming console — and ran a BTC node on his computer. The result was nonces getting incremented on the console’s green screen, showing the rig was attempting to mine crypto.

""The hash rate is pretty impressive, roughly 0.8 hashes per second,"" said Stacksmashing, explaining:

""If you compare that to a modern ASIC miner, which comes in at around 100 Terahashes per second, you can see that we are almost as fast, only off by a factor of roughly 125 trillion. At this rate, it should only take us a couple of quadrillion years to mine a Bitcoin.""

Many crypto enthusiasts have been looking to gaming consoles as a way to mine BTC or other cryptocurrencies for some time, but in general, the systems are neither designed for nor marketed toward miners. Earlier this month, a Chinese software developer seemed to have pranked the crypto space by claiming to have mined Ether (ETH) using a PlayStation 5. Last year, developers from 1st Playable Productions denied rumors that one of its games could be used to hijack Nintendo’s Switch console to mine BTC.

Stacksmashing’s attempts to use an 8-bit gaming console to mine crypto may have been just for the experience, but he has said on Twitter he’s not finished yet. Already the IT security researcher claims to have used Nintendo’s Super Game Boy — an adapter released in 1994 that allows original Game Boy games to be played on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System — to mine BTC in much the same way.

“Obviously, mining Bitcoin on a Game Boy is everything but profitable, but I learned a lot of things while building this and definitely had a ton of fun.”","Why did this happen?

For almost a decade, Bitcoin.se has played a vital role in informing and educating the Swedish public about topics related to cryptocurrencies and their surrounding ecosystem. Since 2012, the site has been the leading independent portal in Swedish for information, news and discussion about cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and economics.

In 2018, Bitcoin.se was introduced to the international audience with an English version. Behind the company is the founder David Hedqvist, one of Scandinavia's foremost crypto evangelists, a Bitcoin enthusiast and board member of the Swedish Bitcoin Association. The journalistic integrity of Bitcoin.se will be safeguarded by David Hedqvist, who will remain as editor-in-chief and an active contributor.

""David has been a strong advocate for the Swedish cryptocurrency market. In the past, he led the court case that set the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies on VAT for the EU, an effort Safello at the time sponsored. Our collaboration has extended over the years and we share the values and objectives of David and Bitcoin.se. We are excited for David to continue his journey together with Safello,"" said Frank Schuil, CEO of Safello.

The acquisition comes after a successful partnership period between Safello and Bitcoin.se, where the latter has used Safello's Partner Widget product. Bitcoin.se contributed to trades generating a significant part of Safello's turnover during the past six months.

In connection with the Bitcoin.se acquisition, Safello is expecting to see significant synergies that are likely to increase Safello's profitability and create opportunities for new customer generation and continued growth.

""After 9 years as a one-man project I felt that Bitcoin.se deserved to be taken to the next level, but it was important to me that it was done in a way that didn't compromise on its core values. My relation with Safello over the last few years has been one of mutual respect and I'm convinced that they are just the right company to take on the task,"" said David Hedqvist, founder of Bitcoin.se and CEO of Rational Money AB.

The news comes on the heels of a recent announcement about several industry veterans' appointment to Safello's Board of Directors. Christina Ploom has previously served as COO at Spotlight Stock Market and has had leading positions at Nasdaq and Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority, Finansinspektionen. Johan Lorenzen is the former CEO of Holvi and long term fintech investor. Knut Pedersen is the former President and CEO of Catella and Managing Partner at ABG Sundal Collier AB.

Safello, backed by reputable investors, including Digital Currency Group (DCG), Northzone and White Star Capital, is in full swing with its plans to be listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market during Q2 2021. Recently, the company announced a strategic partnership with Klarna and a handful of key recruitments, including Johan Edin as Chief Financial Officer and Swedish crypto profile Gina Pari as Client Director.

The company told Reuters it had launched the pilot program with payment and crypto platform Crypto.com and plans to offer the option to more partners later this year.

Bitcoin, the most popular crypto coin, jumped to a one-week high on the news, rising as much as 4.5 percent to $58,300 and heading back toward a record-high above $61,000 hit earlier this month.

Visa subsequently confirmed the news in a statement.

The USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged directly to the U.S. dollar.

Visa’s move comes as finance firms including BNY Mellon, BlackRock and Mastercard take steps to make more use of cryptocurrencies for investment and payment purposes.

Tesla boss Elon Musk, a major proponent of cryptocurrencies, said last week that customers can buy its electric vehicles with bitcoin, hoping to encourage more day-to- day use of the digital currency.

“We see increasing demand from consumers across the world to be able to access, hold and use digital currencies and we’re seeing demand from our clients to be able to build products that provide that access for consumers,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said.

Traditionally, if a customer chooses to use a Crypto.com Visa card to pay for a coffee, the digital currency held in a cryptocurrency wallet needs to be converted into traditional money.

The cryptocurrency wallet will deposit traditional fiat currency in a bank account, to be wired to Visa at the end of the day to settle any transactions, adding cost and complexity for businesses.

Visa’s latest step, which will use the ethereum blockchain, strips out the need to convert digital coin into traditional money in order for the transaction to be settled.

Visa said it has partnered with digital asset bank Anchorage and completed the first transaction this month — with Crypto.com sending USDC to Visa’s Ethereum address at Anchorage.","Over the longer-term Bitcoin’s astonishing price performance has been eclipsed by other smaller alternative cryptocurrencies

Twelve months ago, bitcoin was trading at $5 355. In the last few weeks, it broke $60 000 hitting another all-time high of over $61 500. That’s a 1 048% return over the last year

If that’s not spectacular enough, consider that bitcoin has gained over 100% since the start of January 2021. Since then PayPal has started offering cryptocurrency-related services, Goldman Sachs created a crypto dedicated trading desk and Tesla bought $1.5Bn worth of Bitcoin and just a few days ago announced that you can now buy their cars using Bitcoin.

Big-name corporates and investment banks have also changed their tone with crypto and have come out with price predictions suggesting the current bull run still has plenty of headroom.

As the graph below shows, Bitcoin was by no means the top-performing cryptocurrency over the last year. It was outperformed by Cardano (3 674%), Binance Coin (1 892%), Polkadot (1 174%), Ethereum (1 133%), and Chainlink (1 111%).

Bear in mind that these are highly volatile assets and can move well over 30% up and down each month.

Virtually all of these smaller cryptocurrencies, known as alternative coins or “alt coins” are constituents in the Revix Top 10 Bundle, which has grown in unit value by more than 1 060% over the last 12 months, well ahead of bitcoin’s 12-month return.

Who is Revix?

Revix (www.revix.com) is backed by JSE-listed financial services group Sabvest and was launched in 2018 to make it secure and easy to invest in both individual and ready-made baskets of cryptocurrencies that they call crypto “Bundles”.

Customers can get started with as little as R500 and the fintech charges no sign-up, monthly account, or subscription fees, but rather a simple 1% transaction fee for both buys and sells.

The advantages of owning a crypto bundle with Revix

1.Diversification

One of the advantages of investing using the Top 10 Bundle is that it equally weights each of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies as measured by market capitalisation.

Revix’s Founder and CEO, Sean Sanders, is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) who previously worked as a portfolio manager explains,

“If you were to buy a Top 10 Bundle that was market-weighted, you’d have roughly 73% of your total investment in bitcoin and Ethereum alone. That’s not a diversified crypto portfolio and it’s actually increasing your concentration risk in the largest two cryptocurrencies. If you had taken this same approach in the year 2000 with stocks you would have invested in General Motors and Walmart and would have had little to no exposure to the big success stories of Amazon and Microsoft. Additionally, if something negative happens to Bitcoin or Ethereum then your crypto portfolio is going to be seriously impacted.”

Revix’s Top 10 crypto Bundle allocates 10% to each of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies creating an equally weighted investment that is well diversified.

‘Stablecoins’ (a type of crypto-backed 1:1 by fiat currencies like the US dollar and rand) like Tether or USDC are not included as they don’t offer significant return potential as the crypto sector grows. They will always be equal to the US dollar.

2.Superior Risk-Adjusted Returns

Historically, Revix’s Top 10 Bundle has significantly outperformed an investment in both a market-weighted equivalent crypto Bundle and Bitcoin alone on a risk-adjusted basis.

Including smaller cryptocurrencies in a crypto portfolio with regular monthly rebalancing would have increased your Sharpe ratio: a measure showing how well your investment would have performed given the amount of risk you’ve taken.

“Bitcoin is viewed as the gateway into the cryptocurrency space but in five years there’s likely to be many other large-scale cryptocurrency projects gaining mainstream adoption,” says Sanders. “Owning a slice of the up and comers is the real investment opportunity. Bitcoin is now worth over $1 trillion (R15 trillion) but just seven years back was once worth only a few million dollars. Today, some cryptocurrencies are still relatively small and not well known, which could one day be worth what bitcoin is worth today.

“Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed all other asset categories, but is far behind some of the smaller cryptocurrencies that are gradually pushing their way into the upper ranks for the crypto market cap rankings.”

3.Automated Rebalancing

Revix’s algorithms automatically rebalance a customer’s Bundle holdings monthly, so that they are equally weighted to ensure that they stay up to date with the fast-changing market. This automated process means Bundle holders don’t have to manually calculate which cryptocurrencies to buy and sell on a regular basis.

4.Peace of mind

Before any cryptocurrency enters their Bundle, Revix evaluates it for security, liquidity, regulatory status, and other factors. This ensures it can be held in a safe, secure, and regulatory-compliant manner.

5.Smart price execution

Revix offers their customers a unique price-routing system enabling customers to obtain the best prices available at the moment of purchase or sale. “We aren’t a crypto exchange, and this means we have the ability to source the best pricing and liquidity for our customers across multiple crypto exchanges at any given time,” says Sanders.

Different cryptos perform different functions

“The term ‘cryptocurrency’ is a bit of a misnomer,” adds Sanders. “Cryptoassets is a better term since different cryptocurrencies do different things.”

The top performer over the last 12 months has been Cardano, which is competing with Ethereum and Polkadot to own a new financial architecture called decentralised finance, or DeFi.

Bitcoin accounts for more than 60% of the total crypto market cap, but it is seen as a robust store of value similar in function to gold.

Litecoin is regarded as the “silver” to bitcoin’s perceived status as “digital gold.” While bitcoin will never have more than 21 million digital coins in issue, Litecoin will be able to expand to 84 million. Litecoin was designed to offer faster transaction speeds than bitcoin and is positioning itself as a new form of digital money, offering speed and a relatively low price ($29) to appeal to merchants and investors.

Chainlink fulfils another purpose within the developing DeFi space, by aiming to solve one of the biggest challenges for the practical implementation of smart contracts – connecting blockchains to real-world data – such as price feeds or delivery confirmations – through so-called “oracles blockchain connectivity”. For smart contracts to work, they need external data sources that are accurate and trusted, and Chainlink aims to provide these.

So, there are a lot of crypto assets doing very different things with significant growth potential.

How to invest?

If you are working within an established, reputable crypto investing platform like Revix, you can invest in both ready-made crypto Bundles and individual cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC (a “stablecoin” fully-backed by the US dollar), and a physical gold-backed token called PAX Gold which provides legal ownership of an ounce of gold through Revix’s online platform.

The Smart Contract Crypto Bundle tracks those cryptocurrencies that enable smart contract functionality and include several cryptocurrencies that are looking to challenge Ethereum’s smart contract dominance.

This Bundle comprises cryptocurrencies that enable developers to build applications on top of their blockchains, much like how developers build mobile apps on top of the Apple mobile iOS operating system. The cryptos in this bundle include Ethereum, Cardano, Tron, Neo, and EOS.

Revix also offers a Payment Crypto Bundle, which provides exposure to the largest five payment-focused cryptocurrencies looking to become ‘digital cash’ and compete with government-issued fiat currencies to make digital payments cheaper, faster, and more global. These cryptos include bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Stellar (XLM).

India, the fifth-largest nation by nominal GDP, often makes headlines for its attempts to outlaw crypto, real or rumored. But the government’s less-than-friendly attitude toward crypto has not curbed Indians’ curiosity about it.

Nor do rumors scare away the giants of the crypto world. Just last week, Coinbase announced it is planning to establish its presence in India. Another powerhouse, Binance, has been there since 2019 when it acquired India’s largest crypto exchange, WazirX.

India has a population of 1.4 billion people (the largest in the world after China) that is predominantly young (median age is between 28 and 29 years old) and tech savvy. Over the past few decades, India has become a developer hub for many tech projects around the world.

“India is one of the youngest countries in the world, and these 28- to 29-year-olds are people who want to be a part of the revolution,” said Indian crypto advocate and YouTube influencer Kashif Raza.

India also has the second-largest online population after China, with over half a billion users taking advantage of the cheapest internet in the world. According to the BBC, one gigabyte of mobile data costs $0.26 in India, compared with $12.37 in the U.S. and a global average of $8.53.

This means India has the potential to become “one of the largest crypto economies in the world,” said Mohammed Roshan, former chief scientist at the Unocoin exchange and now the CEO of GoSats, an app allowing people earn bitcoin rewards while shopping online.

Yet, mixed signals sent by the authorities might be keeping some Indians from embracing bitcoin, experts told CoinDesk. India is 11th on Chainalysis’ 2020 report listing global crypto adoption by nation.

Indians’ excitement about crypto is visible, however. According to a report by Quartz, in 2018, one in every 10 bitcoin purchases in the world happened in India. The country is the second-largest source of web traffic to Paxful, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform, after the U.S., according to SimilarWeb.

Last year gave a solid boost to Indians’ interest in crypto overall, Roshan said: “People who didn’t even really know about crypto are now talking about NFTs.”

Stocking up on digital gold

WazirX is the largest exchange in India, acquired by Binance in 2019, and it covers about half of the Indian crypto market. According to CEO Nischal Shetty, WazirX currently has 1.8 million users. Using that figure and the number of crypto app downloads in app stores and web traffic data, Shetty estimated there might be as many as 10 million users in India.

Most WazirX users just buy and hold, Shetty said. While 10% to 15% of the exchange’s customers are “heavy traders who trade every day,” not many use crypto as a vehicle for remittances. By Shetty’s estimate, in India about 1.5 million people are trading crypto while around 6 million are just holding it.

WazirX’s daily trading volume is about $55 million, according to CoinGecko, but has been fluctuating between $16 million and $141 million through the first quarter of 2020. The entire Indian market sees daily volumes of $150 million to $350 million, Shetty believes, and the total value of crypto assets held by Indians is hovering around $1.5 billion. Up to 55% of that might be in bitcoin, Shetty said. For many Indians, bitcoin is digital gold, i.e., a means of saving money.

Indians have a habit of accumulating actual gold as a savings tool, and it has strong cultural roots, said Kashif Raza.

“Indian culture always promoted savings. India has always been a huge holder of gold. Every family is keeping gold in their house,” he said.

When a couple gets married or a child is born, the family is often gifted with gold. That family wealth, in a form of jewelry, can be passed down to new generations.

But India has a history of prohibitive policies against foreign currency purchases, so the habit of saving money in dollars to hedge against inflation that’s popular in South America or Western Europe, doesn’t appear to be as widespread in India.

As Shruti Rajagopalan, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, wrote in an op-ed for Bloomberg, in the 1970s and 1980s, due to the regulation known as the License Raj, Indians could only hold foreign currency for a specific purpose after getting a permit from the central bank. The government would raid people’ houses to seize dollars and gold bars, she added.

Bitcoin is harder to control or confiscate, and it also provides a new way of earning money even when the mainstream economy is doing not so well, especially during the coronavirus pandemic year of 2020.

“Gold would be the investment of choice for the older generation. The young generation sees the advantage … to buy bitcoin, because gold became more stable and bitcoin is so fast-moving,” Shetty said.

Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at the crypto wallet Luno (a CoinDesk sister company), agreed, saying younger Indians view bitcoin as a better investment than gold.

The pandemic may have made crypto more popular. Many people stuck at home for months, some of whom lost their jobs, turned to alternative ways of earning money. Registrations on crypto exchanges went up, Raza said. According to Shetty, WazirX’s user count grew threefold since March 2020, and the trading volume went up by a factor of at least eight.

It also helps bitcoin’s popularity that people in India are closely following U.S. tech companies like PayPal and Tesla, which are embracing bitcoin.

“There is a heavy tech influence from the U.S. in India,” Shetty added.

Not just hodling

Remittances might have been another big use case for crypto in India. India is the largest receiver of inward remittances globally, the World Bank found in 2018, with an inflow of $79 billion.

However, experts who spoke to CoinDesk said not many Indians are using crypto to send money across borders – at least, not yet. Roshan believes one of the reasons is because it’s usually younger Indians who are working abroad and sending money to their older relatives in India, and those relatives “might not know what to do with it.”

The regulatory uncertainty doesn’t help, said Alpen Sheth, senior technologist for financial innovation at Mercy Corps and member of the Digital Currency Governance Consortium at the World Economic Forum.

“If the government is going to come after it, why would I use it? The fact that the RBI [previously] basically prohibited banks from dealing with crypto put up a red flag for a lot of people,” he said.

However, the younger generation might be willing to use bitcoin in different ways, said Roshan.

“Millennials, people past 25 to 26 years old, think of bitcoin as a long term investment. Gen Z people are more about spending. They say: We want to spend sats, we want to get rid of bank cards,” he said.

Mixed messages and the looming ban

In 2013, the first crypto exchange in India, Unocoin, was launched. A day later, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), warned Indians about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. The regulator has been skeptical about crypto, even while encouraging India’s banks to experiment with blockchain.

In April 2018, the RBI barred India’s banks from serving crypto exchanges and related businesses. The country’s crypto industry immediately struck back, challenging the ban in court. In March 2020, India’s Supreme Court ruled against RBI and lifted the ban.

The Indian government started discussing possible crypto regulations back in 2017, but it only introduced a bill into the parliament this past January, which would ban cryptocurrencies except the one RBI might issue in the future. In addition, according to unconfirmed reports, the government might be considering banning and blocking IP addresses associated with crypto exchanges.

At the same time, a reassuring signal came from the minister of finance and corporate affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, who said on March 15 the government is “not shutting all options.”

“We will allow certain windows for people to do experiments on the blockchain, bitcoins or cryptocurrency,” Sitharaman said.

In addition, the government has its eyes on companies that might be using crypto. On March 25, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs announced businesses will have to report crypto on their balance sheets starting April 1.

The regulator is also actively exploring the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, backed by the Indian rupee.

India’s crypto industry does not believe the government will ban crypto. A full ban might hurt not only crypto users but quite a few businesses. In a November 2020 RBI Bulletin, the central bank said there were 342 crypto products and services in India.

WazirX’s Shetty believes things are looking up.

“The bill is a step forward. At least, the government is talking about crypto and the regulation. As an industry we’re doing a number of things to make sure the government understands what this new technology is,” he said.

For crypto services, the regulation means access to banking (because so far only a handful of banks catering to crypto businesses) and clearing the industry of scams.

Talks about the possible crypto ban “caused some panic in the market for sure,” Luno’s Ayyar said, so the market might cool down in the coming months due to the uncertainty.

However, “the finance minister seemed quite positive about ensuring that innovation does not get trampled and hence the industry is in general hopeful of a positive outcome overall,” he added.

Sheth said he believes things might go either way.

“The government may take a very harsh action against cryptocurrency. But there is not much consistency inside the government about that, seems like there are conflicting perspectives about it inside the government,” he said.

He added that because of that inconsistency, it’s very hard to predict what will happen next.

“Even people who talk to government officials don’t know much,” he said. But he expects the regulators most likely will adapt to the new reality and choose to ban only payments in crypto (which means, using it as money that competes with the national currency) and oblige people to report crypto gains for their taxes.

At the end of the day, most crypto exchanges in India have two entities, one in India and one abroad, so if things turn hostile at home they can easily move operations out, Raza and Roshan told CoinDesk. Popular jurisdictions include Singapore, the UAE and Estonia.

In the meantime, scary rumors of the future crypto ban only piques people’s curiosity, Sheth said. “The rumored ban is stimulating a lot of conversation among the population about cryptocurrency,” he said, adding:","In brief Seven Indian crypto exchanges have jointly prepared a presentation note for policymakers.

The initiative follows a proposed ban on all private cryptocurrencies in the country.

As a ban on cryptocurrency looms in India, seven of the country's cryptocurrency exchanges are reaching out to the country's finance minister and central bank to address their concerns around digital assets, The Economic Times reported today.

According to Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange WazirX, India’s Blockchain and Crypto Council plans to send out a presentation note that contains recommendations on how to effectively regulate cryptocurrencies and mitigate risks usually associated with them. The country’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are among the note’s addressees.

The joint effort has seen the crypto exchanges prepare a full presentation containing data on global regulatory practices, a proposed code of conduct for digital trading platforms, a whitepaper that outlines the potential consequences of a blanket ban, and other materials.

""The industry as a whole has begun self-regulation and implementing KYC procedures to prohibit illicit activities,"" said Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of Unocoin. ""We have created a unified procedure that gets followed among the exchanges so that when we try to represent as an association in front of the ministry we will have a concrete method which could add to our credibility.""

Eventually, the group hopes to present their case formally, said Shetty. ""But we did not want to wait, we wanted to take a proactive approach.""

India's looming crypto ban

Over the past few years, India’s crypto industry has operated in a state of uncertainty as the country’s regulators repeatedly raised the prospect of a blanket ban on cryptocurrency. Industry players have launched an intensive lobbying campaign aimed at softening their stance and pressing for a regulatory framework.

""We have certain major concerns about cryptocurrency. We have communicated them to the government. On crypto, we have major concerns from a financial stability angle which we have shared with the government,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said in late February.

At the time, the RBI has stated that cryptocurrencies can cause ""financial instability,"" calling digital assets a ""major concern.""

Between 2015 and 2018, India’s oldest crypto exchange Unocoin and trading platform ZebPay reportedly reached out to the RBI up to five times—but to no avail.

""We have approached different high-level officers at the RBI, but it's only been a one-way conversation,"" explained Vishwanath. ""They were not disclosing what they want. They were receiving our documents so whatever we were trying to say, they were listening to our conversations, but that's pretty much where it was stopping.""

The country's finance minster has taken a less hardline stance on crypto than the RBI, noting in early March that the government's position on cryptocurrency will be ""calibrated"" and will allow for ""a window available for all types of experiments in the crypto world.""

That's welcome news for Indian crypto holders—as is the recent endorsement of tech billionaire Nandan Nilekani, who's argued that India's citizens should be allowed to own cryptocurrencies.","The apex cryptocurrency by market cap — Bitcoin (BTC) — is losing its dominance, leading analysts to label the trend as the coming of the so-called ""altcoin season.""

What Happened: At press time, BTC enjoyed a market dominance of 59.1% with Ethereum (ETH) at second place with 11.4% dominance. BTC’s dominance is at its lowest since October last year, as per CoinMarketCap data.

Pointing towards BTC dominance, Altcoins-USD market cap and the BTC/USD spot price analyst Filbfilb tweeted “Alt szn.”

Why It Matters: Analyst Michaël van de Poppe expects a “very bullish” summer for altcoins as their market capitalization touches new highs hovering near the $750 billion mark, reported Cointelegraph.

On Monday, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) launched a pilot to allow transactions to be settled through USD Coin (USDC) on its network.

On the Visa announcement, Poppe said on Twitter that “[Ethereum] is going to surprise everyone massively.” Poppe had in January predicted a $10,000 price level for ETH.

Crypto trader and investor Scott Melker tweeted that “Altcoins look great” on Monday.

As for BTC, trader and analyst Rekt Capital said on Monday that the apex cryptocurrency has bottomed.

Harmony (ONE) has surged 4553% in 2021 to press time, as per Messari data. Pundi X (NPXS) has seen a 4203% spike, Enjin Coin (ENJ) has surged 1684.7%, and Theta Fuel (TFUEL) has seen an 1105% surge. Among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, those outperforming Bitcoin this year including Binance Coin (BNB) at 620%, Cardano (ADA) at 582%, Polkadot (DOT) at 306%, and Uniswap (UNI) at 500%.

Price Action: BTC traded 3.83% higher at $57,397.80 while ETH traded 6.39% higher at $1,795.18 in a 24-hour period leading up to press time.

Whether it’s PayPal announcing support for crypto or Tesla adding $1.5 billion of BTC to its balance sheet, the world’s best-known digital asset is starting to attract the sort of mainstream coverage that once seemed fanciful. With renewed interest from both institutional and everyday investors, it’s natural to wonder where bitcoin is headed. To the moon, as its proponents claim? Or will somewhere closer to Earth suffice?

Joel Edgerton, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of San Francisco-based crypto exchange bitFlyer USA, is unsurprisingly bullish about bitcoin – and many other virtual currencies besides. The only cryptocurrency platform in the world licensed in the US, EU, and Japan, bitFlyer is a regulator-friendly venue that features a professional-grade trading engine built by Wall Street veterans. According to Edgerton, bitFlyer remains true to the ethos of Bitcoin while also enabling traditional investors and hedge funds to enter the crypto space and strengthen its value proposition.

Why more people are buying bitcoin

Bitcoin has well and truly paid its dues, and despite flak from all the usual sources, it’s now perceived as a compelling investable asset – one routinely used to rebalance portfolios formerly composed of bonds and equities. Bitcoin’s rise from the depths of $3k a year ago to around $54,000 at the time of writing is nothing short of phenomenal, says Edgerton.

When Bitcoin’s market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, it gave even the naysayers pause. Soaring prices provoked frenzied activity here at bitFlyer, as many altcoins enjoyed tremendous gains in bitcoin’s wake.

The attitude of newcomers is easy to fathom, of course: they hear friends or family members talk about bitcoin, they learn that Tesla and MicroStrategy are buying up enormous sums, and then they learn that bitcoin is a bonafide hard currency – unlike fiat. A report recently leaked from Citibank showed that a senior analyst believes bitcoin could hit $318,000 by the end of the year. While it might fall well short of that figure, for many, buying bitcoin is preferable to storing wealth in a super low-interest savings account.

As for institutional players – the NYDIG just raised $200 million in growth capital from partners including Morgan Stanley, New York Life and MassMutual – we are seeing a domino effect, says Edgerton. Don’t get me wrong, some genuinely believe in bitcoin and love what it brings to the table in an era of mass money-printing. But others simply take the approach that it’s best to incorporate bitcoin on their balance sheet – because they might look silly later on for not having done so.

Robinhood brouhaha pushes traders towards crypto

The GameStop scandal, wherein popular trading app Robinhood prevented customers from buying shares, provoked a congressional hearing and compelled many traders to explore alternatives. According to Edgerton, the event exposed fissures in the traditional financial system.

I’ve been very critical of Robinhood in the past, specifically with regards to their lack of customer protections. Last year, a young trader on their platform committed suicide after falsely believing he had gotten himself into huge debt trading complex options contracts. From the outside looking in, this seemed like such a preventable tragedy: allowing novice traders to access highly risky financial instruments without safeguards is a recipe for disaster.

As for GameStop, the event proved to be a perfect storm that pushed many users towards decentralized cryptocurrencies and platforms, where the powers-that-be couldn’t hit a kill-switch to halt trading and protect those on the other side of the bet. Of course, regulations are still important. bitFlyer USA recently received a license in Connecticut, meaning we are now regulated in 48 U.S. states. Soon, it’ll be all 50.

As COO of a centralized trading platform, is Edgerton worried about the growth of decentralized finance (defi) platforms? Specifically decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and Sushiswap?

I believe CEXs and DEXs can coexist, he says. Cefi is still the king in terms of liquidity and security, while defi has plenty to offer in its own right, especially in terms of offering automated financial services. As it stands, what we are seeing is that major institutional players favor CEXs like bitFlyer due to their high-speed trading engines and legal stability.

Regulation for the good

In my view, crypto needs structured regulatory frameworks to ensure safety, fairness and transparency, and to elevate the reputation of the industry as a whole. In the past, projects have been fined for conducting unregistered securities sales while exchanges have faced accusations of wash trading. Some regulators have also banned derivatives for retail investors.

I don’t agree that introducing regulations compromises bitcoin, because the properties that make the asset attractive – its finite supply, its state-free status – remain. If properly implemented, regulations will help to reduce scams and ensure consumer protection in an industry that is, after all, still evolving.

It’s a little too early to say how incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will influence industry regulation. Certainly she has noted a need to legislate to prevent illicit usage of bitcoin, which is to be expected. But it’s definitely good to see some crypto-friendly figures taking executive roles in Biden’s administration – former Ripple advisor Michael Barr looks likely to head up the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), for example, while Hester Peirce remains S.E.C. Commissioner.

Charity starts at home

Though philanthropy seems a million miles away from the rampant market speculation facilitated by bitFlyer, Binance and Coinbase, Edgerton is keen to draw attention to worthy causes. Bitcoin has enriched many of its early adopters, he says, accelerating a transfer of wealth to a generation of tech-savvy individuals keen to make a better world. That’s why we are seeing NFT charity auctions, and exchanges donating a percentage of their fee revenue to non-profits.

As well as that, we are seeing everyday users donate in crypto rather than fiat. Fidelity Investments’ gift fund, Fidelity Charitable, received almost $30 million worth of donations in cryptocurrency last year. At bitFlyer, we have our own crowdfunding portal, fundFlyer, that lets people raise funds in bitcoin to finance worthy initiatives. Our latest initiative was to build a school in Ghana, and the community came together to raise over 10 BTC – over half a million dollars at the current price!

Honestly, it’s a great time to be working in crypto, says Edgerton. While that statement would be true in any bull market, this one is institutionally-driven and the direction of travel has never been clearer. We are seeing private banks launch trading and custody services, and assets like bitcoin and ETH gain additional utility due to, for example, fiat on/off ramps and merchant acceptance. While peering into the crystal ball is a futile pursuit, the positivity pervading the industry right now augurs well.","Why did this happen?

This Game Boy will manage to mine a Bitcoin block in… perhaps a couple of quadrillion years? Let's just say the portable 8-bit console first released in 1989 isn't much of a mining rig, and by the time it nets a successful hash the solar system as we know it will be gone, but you probably guessed that already.

YouTube channel stacksmashing (via TweakTown) gave it a shot nevertheless, and I have to say watching someone turn a childhood favourite into a miniscule mining machine is entertaining to watch despite being doomed from the very beginning—even with gaming's uncomfortable relationship with cryptocurrency mining today.

The key to the Game Boy's mining capability actually lies in the Raspberry Pi Pico, a low-cost and tiny Pi board that can set you back as little as $4. Since the Game Boy has no way to communicate with the Bitcoin network, the Pico will take care of that. A modified Link Cable connects the Game Boy to the Pico (via logic shifter to shift the voltage from 5V to the 3.3V required by the Pico) and the Pico connects to a PC.

Add in a modified Game Boy cartridge with USB flash drive onboard filled with the necessary mining ROMs and away you go.

Bitcoin is almost exclusively mined by ASICs, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits nowadays, not GPUs. These are now available with hash rates upwards of 100TH/s, with the Antminer S19 Pro managing 110TH/s.

The modded Game Boy will manage 0.8H/s off its miniscule Sharp LR35902 CPU. That's hashes per second and not megahashes per second, by the way.

The S19 Pro gobbles up 3,250W, though, so the Game Boy's four AA batteries may make it just a little less power hungry. It's not very efficient, though.

The Game Boy was at least perfectly capable of mining a custom empty Bitcoin blockchain with a very low difficulty. Success!"
2021-03-30,"Multiple news sources have declared Visa the crypto leader based on a Visa press release announcing that it used a stablecoin backed by the US dollar (USD Coin) to settle a transaction with Visa over Ethereum. From the Visa press release and blog, it appears that the transaction was performed with a Crypto.com-issued Visa card.

The press release doesn’t state what merchant accepted the card or the value of the transaction, however, the settlement funds came from Anchorage, the first federally chartered digital asset bank. Because the settlement was made using a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (USD Coin), no exchange rate had to be calculated and executed.

There is a lot of heavy lifting going on here. Connecting the Visa settlement and treasury functions to Anchorage, even for a one-to-one stablecoin as the first test, is a substantial understaking in risk management. Of course it will be even more difficult to enable more popular crypto assets that fluctuate in value:



“On Monday, Visa said it accepted a virtual currency payment for the first time, marking a milestone for the 62-year-old company. Specifically, the payments giant settled a transaction using cryptocurrency plumbing known as the Ethereum blockchain, a distributed accounting ledger based on the technology behind Bitcoin. The transaction involved a Visa partner, Crypto.com, a Hong Kong-based issuer of cryptocurrency-backed prepaid cards, sending Visa a U.S. dollar-pegged virtual currency called USD Coin, or USDC. Visa said it worked with Anchorage, a Visa-backed cryptocurrency startup that is one of the U.S.’s newest federally chartered banks, to accept the payment. Visa said the move is part of a pilot program to make life easier for cryptocurrency businesses. Visa wants to eliminate the hassle of it requiring customers to convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency, like U.S. dollars, before settling up their accounts on the Visa network. The company said it plans to expand the feature to other members of its payments networks, and potentially to other virtual currencies, later this year. This is the latest in a string of cryptocurrency-related announcements for Visa. Earlier this month, Visa CEO Al Kelly told Fortune CEO Alan Murray that Visa is working to let people to buy Bitcoin and to make payments using Bitcoin through the Visa network, following the lead of financial tech, or fintech, companies like PayPal and Square. In February, Visa introduced a product to help banks integrate Bitcoin into their mobile apps. Visa is one of several payments giants looking to capitalize on the latest cryptocurrency craze. Ajay Banga, the chairman and former CEO of MasterCard, Visa’s perennial rival, recently told Fortune he’s less interested in Bitcoin but very keen on the potential for central bank digital currencies, a government-backed variety. Meanwhile, younger businesses, such as PayPal and Square, are all seeking to place themselves at the forefront of the Bitcoin bull run.”

Overview by Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation at Mercator Advisory Group","On March 26th, over $6 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts expired. However, over the past week, as the expiration approached, traders feared that a massive drop in BTC price will damage their funds, so they started selling, causing a price drop as a result. And, with Bitcoin’s overwhelming dominance over the crypto industry, most coins ended up following suit, including Ethereum.

Experts expecting a new bull run

The expiring BTC options were one of the biggest topics for days, but now that they have expired, traders started looking ahead again and seem optimistic about what they see. A new set of April contracts indicates that options traders expect a major new surge — one that will result in a new ATH. In fact, the contracts suggest that Bitcoin might soar to $80k next.

It appears that institutional investors are also feeling positive about the future of Bitcoin, as they continued buying the coins despite the recent price dip, that took BTC down by 14%. Financial institutions believe that there is about to be a surge in interest, as retail wealth management companies are starting to offer Bitcoin to their clients. The move mirrors what Morgan Stanley did recently, and indicates that crypto adoption is continuing to flourish.

However, one investor fears that the US government might decide to put a stop to it. Ray Dalio recently warned that the government might move to ban Bitcoin, just as they did with gold nearly a century ago, back in the 1930s.

For now, however, there are more and more things that BTC holders can do, such as buy a new Tesla, according to Elon Musk’s recent announcement. Musk said that Tesla will now officially start accepting Bitcoin payments for their electric cars.

Interestingly enough, Ethereum’s price has been recovering also, despite a recent piece of bad news. Namely, Ethereum’s upcoming scaling solution, Optimism, was supposed to go live this week, until developers announced that it will be delayed. Now, they believe that the mainnet will not be able to launch before July of this year. The fact that Ethereum price is recovering despite this news can only indicate that the second-largest crypto is following Bitcoin’s lead.

BTC and ETH prices on the rise

As mentioned, this was a difficult week for Bitcoin and Ethereum, at least until yesterday, when prices finally started to rise again. According to CEX.IO data, BTC dropped from a weekly high of $58,417 to $50,500 in only three days. After the contracts expired yesterday, however, the price surged again, reaching $55,518.

Ethererum’s chart looks fairly similar, with a gradual decline between March 22nd and March 24th, followed by a sharp drop late March 24th, from $1746 to $1549.

Since then, the coin started seeing recovery that took it to $1717, before a minor correction.

What is coming next for BTC and ETH?

Originally, I expected Bitcoin to hit $50k per coin by the end of Q1, which is on March 31st. For a long while, it appeared that the coin has seriously overperformed and that it might end the quarter significantly higher. The drop caused by the expiring options then hinted that the forecast might be correct after all, only for the price to start correcting and once again head towards $60k.

However, judging by the new set of contracts, it might be that the forecast regarding Q2 might still hold, as Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model did indicate that the coin will end the quarter at $80,000 per coin. Of course, there are still months before we reach that point, and a lot can still happen in the meantime.

Ethereum has overperformed also, as I expected it to be at $1,300 by the end of the first quarter. However, the coin sits at $1687 at the time of writing, which is significantly higher, and it promises to move even further up in days to come. As for Q2, I expect to see it hit $2,200. After that, I expect an even larger surge as developers continue down their way to ETH 2.0 upgrade, with the coin ending the year at $4,900.","One of the world’s largest financial institutions backing most credit and debit cards in the world, Visa has announced that it will now allow the use of cryptocurrency through its platform.

Reuters

Reported first by Reuters, it has announced that it will allow the use of USD Coin -- a virtual US dollar, a form of cryptocurrency. The company announced that it is working on a pilot program with payments and cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com and it will extend this with more partners in the latter half of this year.

One thing crucial to note here is that it is only allowing transacting through USD Coin cryptocurrency, which has its value pegged directly to the U.S. dollar, unlike the popular Bitcoin which not only is regarded as the most popular cryptocurrency platform in the world but is also currently sitting at a value of $58,000 with the value on the rise and on its way to its previous record-breaking value off $61,000.

How does it work?

Visa’s implementation of accepting crypto payments is made possible with it teaming up with digital asset bank Anchorage and Crypto.com’s Visa card.

It is using Ethereum blockchain that eliminates the need to convert digital coin into traditional money. Earlier it would require Crypto.com to convert the bitcoin into regular money and then send it to Visa, which had several steps that made the process a lot more complex. However, now, Crypto directly sends USD Coin cryptocurrency to Visa’s own Ethereum address at Anchorage.

Global impact of cryptocurrency

Visa is the next in line to take cryptocurrency seriously after several financial institutions like Mastercard, BlackRock Inc and BNY Mellon have made their move to make use of cryptocurrencies for investments and payments.

Just last week, we saw Elon Musk announce that Tesla will accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric car and truck purchases.

Reuters

Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a statement, ""We see increasing demand from consumers across the world to be able to access, hold and use digital currencies and we're seeing demand from our clients to be able to build products that provide that access for consumers.""

It’ll be interesting to see if Visa adds support for other kinds of cryptocurrency including the popular ones like Dogecoin and Bitcoin.","Will you be paying with a Visa, Mastercard or Bitcoin?

Payments processing giant PayPal announced Tuesday that it will let users ""checkout with Crypto,"" offering options such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash.

Users who have enough cryptocurrency to cover a potential purchase on a website that accepts PayPal Checkout will see it pop up as a payment option.

Once the customer confirms a purchase at checkout, the cryptocurrency is then converted to fiat currency – or government-issued money – by PayPal to complete the transaction. PayPal also won't charge a transaction fee.

""Enabling cryptocurrencies to make purchases at businesses around the world is the next chapter in driving the ubiquity and mass acceptance of digital currencies,"" said PayPal CEO and President Dan Schulman in a statement.

PayPal is the latest company to support cryptocurrency as a form of payment, as businesses increasingly lend credibility.

Last week, Tesla announced that it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment from customers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said those payments would be retained as Bitcoin and not converted to fiat currency.

Meanwhile, crypto assets have surged in popularity recently, most notably nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. Earlier this month, the auction house Christie's announced that artist Beeple sold a piece of artwork as an NFT for more than $69 million.

But Christodoulou is angrier at Apple than at the thieves themselves: He says Apple marketed the App Store as a safe and trusted place, where each app is reviewed before it is allowed in the store.

Christodoulou, once a loyal Apple customer, said he no longer admires the company. “They betrayed the trust that I had in them,” he said in an interview. “Apple doesn’t deserve to get away with this.”

Apple bills its App Store as “the world’s most trusted marketplace for apps,” where every submission is scanned and reviewed, ensuring they are safe, secure, useful and unique. But in fact, it’s easy for scammers to circumvent Apple’s rules, according to experts. Criminal app developers can break Apple’s rules by submitting seemingly innocuous apps for approval and then transforming them into phishing apps that trick people into giving up their information, according to Apple. When Apple finds out, it removes the apps and bans the developers, the company says. But it’s too late for the people who fell for the scam.

Crypto scams are also common on Google’s Android and on the Web. But their presence on the Apple App Store is more surprising because Apple says it curates the store and checks each app, which creates high levels of consumer trust. The 15 to 30 percent commission Apple collects on all sales on the App Store goes to fund the “highly curated” customer experience, the company has said.

“User trust is at the foundation of why we created the App Store, and we have only deepened that commitment in the years since,” said Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz. “Study after study has shown that the App Store is the most secure app marketplace in the world, and we are constantly at work to maintain that standard and to further strengthen the App Store’s protections. In the limited instances when criminals defraud our users, we take swift action against these actors as well as to prevent similar violations in the future.”

The ability of apps to morph into something else entirely after they are approved by the App Store raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple’s review process to stop scammers. Apple wouldn’t say how often these scams appear, or how often it removes them. But it did say it removed 6,500 apps for “hidden or undocumented features” last year. Apple touts user safety as its defense against accusations from lawmakers, regulators and competitors that the company uses its monopoly over app distribution on iPhones anti-competitively.

“Apple frequently pushes myths about user privacy and security as a shield against its anti-competitive App Store practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, executive director of the Coalition for App Fairness, which was formed to fight Apple’s power over its App Store. “The truth is, Apple’s security ‘standards’ are inconsistently applied across apps and only enforced when it benefits Apple.”

Apple acknowledged there have been other cryptocurrency scams on the App Store but wouldn’t say how many. Apple wouldn’t say whether fake Trezor apps had sneaked into the App Store in the past, or whether new apps called “Trezor” will be flagged as potentially fraudulent in the future.

Coinfirm, a U.K.-based company that specializes in cryptocurrency regulations and conducts fraud investigations, says it has received more than 7,000 inquiries about stolen crypto assets since October 2019. Fake apps in Google’s Android Play Store and Apple’s App Store are common, said Pawel Aleksander, the company’s chief information officer.

Coinfirm said five people have reported having cryptocurrency stolen by the fake Trezor app on iOS, for total losses worth $1.6 million. There have been three reports of fake Trezor apps on Android that stole a total of $600,000 in cryptocurrency.

Apple would not name the developer of the fake Trezor app or provide the developer’s contact information. Apple wouldn’t say whether it was turning over the name to law enforcement or whether it investigated the developer further. Apple also wouldn’t say whether that developer had developed any other apps in the past or had connections to other developer accounts under different names.

“We don’t allow apps that mislead users by impersonating another app, developer or company, and when we discover an app that violates our policies, we take appropriate action,” said Google spokesperson Colin Smith.

Google said it knows of two fake Trezor apps that have appeared on the Google Play store. It removed both. It didn’t say how the Trezor apps made it onto the store. The company didn’t say whether it notified law enforcement, or how many other scam apps it has found on the store. It didn’t say whether it investigated the developers. Analytics firm App Figures was able to find eight fake Trezor apps that have appeared on the Play Store.

Of all the Internet scams, the theft of cryptocurrency is one of the most lucrative for thieves. Millions of dollars in digital currency can be pilfered in a split-second, and high-profile crypto heists have netted thieves as much as $530 million, which occurred in the Coincheck hack in 2018. In 2014, Apple banned crypto wallets on the App Store but then restored them the same year. Apple does not allow cryptocurrency mining apps, and it places extra restrictions on crypto wallet apps.

To better secure their investments, people who own cryptocurrencies transfer their investments to “hardware wallets,” which are like USB thumb drives that store the secret and sensitive information a thief would need to steal someone’s cryptocurrency.

Hardware wallets plug into a computer via a USB connection. By typing in a PIN and sometimes an additional passphrase, the hardware wallet can be accessed and used to make transactions. If a hardware wallet is lost or destroyed, the information can be restored with a secret “seed phrase.” Some people keep the seed phrase in a safe-deposit box, hoping they’ll never have to use it, or etched on durable metal that can survive a fire. Scammers use phishing to trick people into giving up their seed phrases.

Trezor, based in the Czech Republic and owned by a company called Satoshi Labs, is a well-known maker of hardware wallets. Trezor doesn’t have a mobile app, but crypto thieves created a fake one and put it on Apple’s App Store in January and the Google Play Store in December, according to those companies, tricking some unsuspecting Trezor customers into entering their seed phrases.

Kristyna Mazankova, a spokeswoman for Trezor, said the company has been notifying Apple and Google for years about fake apps posing as a Trezor product to scam its customers. Trezor has never had a mobile app, though the company is working on one. She said the process of reporting the apps is “painful” and that representatives of Apple and Google haven’t been in contact.

Mazankova said Trezor notified Apple about a copycat app on Feb 1. Apple removed the app on Feb. 3, but it appeared again days later, according to Christodoulou, before it was removed again.

The fake Trezor app got through the app store through a bait-and-switch, according to Apple. Though it was called Trezor and used the Trezor logo and colors, it represented itself as a “cryptography” app that would encrypt iPhone files and store passwords, according to Apple. The developer of the fake Trezor app told Apple’s review team it “is not involved in any cryptocurrency.” Apple approved the app and it appeared in the App Store on Jan. 22, according to mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower.

Some time later, unbeknown to Apple, the Trezor cryptography app changed itself into a cryptocurrency wallet. Apple does not allow these sorts of changes, but Apple says it does not know when they occur. It relies on users and customers to report it when it happens, the company said.

After Trezor reported the fake app to Apple, Apple says it removed the app and banned the developer. Two days later, another fake Trezor app appeared. Apple removed that app, too. Apple did not say how it found out about the fake apps, but said it removed them because they were fraudulent.

Sensor Tower said the Trezor app was on the Apple App Store from at least Jan. 22 to Feb. 3 and appears to have been downloaded about 1,000 times. The app was downloaded about 1,000 times on Android, but Sensor Tower did not collect data on exactly when it became available.

James Fajcz, a reliability engineer at a paper company who lives in Savannah, Ga., also had his cryptocurrency stolen by the fake Trezor app, he says. In December, as he saw prices of the digital tokens rising, he purchased about $14,000 worth of Ethereum and bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance with money from his savings.

He wanted to make sure his investment was secure, so he purchased a Trezor Model T hardware wallet and downloaded an app on his iPhone called Trezor, which asked for his seed phrase. The app didn’t connect to his Trezor wallet, and he figured it didn’t work.

Weeks later, he purchased more Ethereum on Coinbase. He plugged in his Trezor device, but nothing was there. He went on the Trezor support forum on Reddit for answers. A Reddit poster informed him: There is no Trezor app. “My jaw dropped to the floor. My heart sank,” he said. “I realized what I did.”

Fajcz said he called Apple’s support line. An Apple representative said the company was not responsible, Fajcz says. “This was a trusted app on the App Store claiming to be the best and most trusted app store on any system anywhere,” he said. “And this nefarious app gets on the platform? I feel Apple should be held partially or fully responsible for that.”

Over a few years, Christodoulou had amassed 18.1 bitcoin. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, each was worth about $5,500. By October, the price was starting to skyrocket, topping out at $60,000 early this year.

Christodoulou had hoped his bitcoin holdings would help save his dry-cleaning business, which was decimated during the pandemic. On Feb. 1, he wanted to be able to check his bitcoin balance using his phone, instead of a computer. So he checked the App Store, downloaded the fake Trezor app and entered his seed phrase.

Immediately afterward, he plugged his Trezor hardware wallet into his computer and logged in to check his balance. It was all gone.

That evening, Christodoulou went into the App Store again to look more closely at the reviews. Before it was removed, the Trezor app had 155 reviews on the App Store for a rating of close to five stars, according to App Figures, the analytics firm. When Christodoulou opened up the written reviews, he read complaints from other people who had been scammed in the same way. The five-star ratings that helped make the app seem legitimate must have been fake, he concluded.

Christodoulou called Apple customer support and a representative said he would escalate it to a supervisor. He said he also notified Apple and filed a report with the FBI. Lauren Hagee Glintz, an FBI spokeswoman, declined to comment on the report.

Chainalysis, a commercial blockchain analysis firm, reviewed documents provided by Fajcz and Christodoulou and confirmed that their cryptocurrency was moved from their wallets to a suspicious account. Both thefts appeared related, said Madeleine Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Chainalysis. “There’s evidence this is a substantial scam bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she said.

Only one of Christodoulou’s 18.1 bitcoin was spared because he transferred it to a bitcoin savings service called BlockFi. At the time of the theft, his 17.1 stolen bitcoin were worth $600,000, but they soon went up in value to $1 million.

Christodoulou says he’s taking medication and seeing a psychiatrist. “It broke me. I’m still not recovered from it,” he said.","Dive Brief:

Chipotle Mexican Grill will celebrate National Burrito Day on April 1 by giving away $100,000 in free burritos and $100,000 of bitcoin cryptocurrency. The fast-casual chain is challenging customers to guess the correct six-digit passcode on its ""Burritos or Bitcoin"" microsite to unlock the prizes, per details emailed to Marketing Dive.

Chipotle plans to give out $25,000 of bitcoin to three customers as a grand prize, $500 in the cryptocurrency to 50 winners and free burritos to 10,000 entrants. After registering at the site, each player will get 10 chances to crack the code for a chance to win the prizes. Players who don't guess the passcode will receive a special offer from Chipotle.

Winners need to have a U.S.-based custodial wallet with either Coinbase or Gemini — companies that let people set up digital wallets for free — to accept bitcoin as a prize, according to the contest rules. The campaign comes amid heightened interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Dive Insight:

Chipotle's ""Burritos or Bitcoin"" contest taps into the heightened interest in the crypocurrency, whose value jumped 10-fold from a year earlier to a record of more than $60,000 a coin earlier this month. Bitcoin this year has gained greater attention after billionaire Elon Musk announced that his electric-car startup Tesla had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would start accepting bitcoins for payments later this year.

Chipotle can parlay the heightened interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into greater participation in its content for National Burrito Day. The passcode game is a playful nod to Stefan Thomas, the founder and CEO of tech firm Coil, who infamously lost the password to a hard drive that stored $387 million in Bitcoin. In partnership with Thomas, Chipotle is positioning the contest as a mock ""chiptocurrency"" rescue mission. The campaign comes as other marketers have leveraged the buzz around cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, including recent efforts by Michelob Ultra, Pizza Hut and P&G's Charmin.

By asking people to register for a chance to win burritos or bitcoin, Chipotle can continue to build out its first-party data about consumers for future campaigns. First-party data has become much more valuable to marketers as they confront the pending loss of audience tracking technologies like third-party cookies and device identifiers amid consumer concerns about privacy. Chipotle has taken a similar tack with its Chipotle Rewards program that was expanded nationwide in 2019, giving the burrito chain a way to learn more about its consumers and provide them with incentives to either order through its digital channels or visit its locations repeatedly. Chipotle has shown a willingness to experiment with the latest payment technologies, including its giveaway of $250,000 through Venmo to promote its rewards program two years ago.

Chipotle has been forward-thinking in its approach to technology. The company this month made its first significant investment in a third-party technology company by participating in a funding round for Nuro, an autonomous delivery startup. The fast-casual chain also expanded the adoption of digital technology with its digital kitchens and Chipotlanes efforts.

The ""Burritos or Bitcoin"" sweepstakes follows several efforts to engage younger consumers through digital channels. The fast-casual chain this month again collaborated with beauty brand E.l.f. Cosmetics on a limited-time menu item and makeup collection inspired by burrito ingredients. The campaign include activations on video-sharing site YouTube, social video app TikTok and live audio app Clubhouse.","Bitcoin traders appear to be ratcheting up bets on a fresh rally, and they’re taking on more leverage – and risk – in cryptocurrency derivatives markets.

In the past few days, the cost to fund a long position in the market for bitcoin (BTC) perpetual swaps, a type of derivatives in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, has broken above neutral levels for the first time since mid-March, according to Arcane Research, a Norwegian analysis firm.

The average cost is now pushing toward 0.08%. That’s still well below a level close to 0.12% witnessed earlier this month when bitcoin surged to an all-time high price above $61,000, or earlier in the year, when the funding cost was roughly twice as high.

But the recent rise appears to show traders finding a renewed appetite for risk taking following a market shakeout over the past couple of weeks. Bitcoin’s price fell to just above $50,000 as recently as March 25.

“The funding rate spikes coincide with strong optimism and high leverage from short-term traders,” according to the Arcane report.

“The funding rates have once again started to move upwards after two weeks in the neutral territory,” similar to the final weeks of January and February, according to Arcane.

“After the initial breakouts from the neutral territory, bitcoin began moving upwards towards new price highs, but not without volatility.""

A positive funding rate in cryptocurrency derivatives markets means traders with long positions pay those with short positions.

Eventually, rising payouts from long traders to short traders could make downward price bets more attractive using bitcoin perpetual swaps. But BTC optimism is not yet at an extreme, which means longs could remain active at support levels.","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will focus first on regulating stablecoins rather than the broader cryptocurrency market, its financial services minister said on Tuesday, citing the threat to competition should any major private effort dominate the emerging field.

Facebook Inc’s move in 2019 to introduce its own stablecoin Diem, then known as Libra, raised concerns among governments and central banks that a major payments competitor could emerge overnight.

“We need to manage risks to competition,” John Glen told a City & Financial conference.

“There is the potential for some firms to swiftly achieve dominance and crowd out other players, due to their ability to scale and plug into existing online services,” Glen said.

“We believe the case for intervention in the wider cryptocurrency markets is less immediately pressing.”

Stablecoins such as the planned Diem, which is now run by an association that includes Facebook and currently seeking approval in Switzerland, are designed to avoid the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Stablecoins have become the largest component of cryptocurrencies by trading volume, Glen said. While no globally systemic player has yet emerged, he added, this could change rapidly.

The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation, Tether, is a fraction of the size of bitcoin and little used for commerce. Most stablecoins are used for trading and investment.

Glen said Britain would not hold back innovation or be protectionist when it comes to using distributed ledger technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity here to make vast strides in the efficiency of financial services, and ultimately benefit consumers and the economy as a whole,” he said.

Separately, Britain’s financial watchdog said it would not be suitable to impose existing electronic money - “e-money” - rules on stablecoins, as some are backed by several currencies or other assets.

“The e-money regime isn’t a perfect match for crypto,” said Alex Roy, head of consumer distribution policy at the Financial Conduct Authority, at the same conference.

Britain’s e-money regulations authorise cashless payments with money kept on a card or phone, or online.",
2021-03-31,"Earlier PayPal enabled its account holders to buy and hold crypto. That crypto can now be used to fund purchases made at merchants that accept PayPal. The merchants will fund the cost of converting crypto to dollars, whatever that cost might be, through PayPal’s existing currency conversion fee structure.

Traditionally a bitcoin holder either, sends bitcoin and pays a fee to miners to have that transaction added to the blockchain quickly, or the bitcoin holder pays an exchange to convert bitcoin to US Dollars. With this structure crypto holders pay nothing, the merchant picks up the tab.

With both PayPal and Visa enabling crypto at a fundamental level, the conversion of crypto holdings into payments will likely expand boosting overall network transaction numbers. Here are two of several concerns:

Transaction fees for Bitcoin are unstable and are likely to increase because in a few months the miner’s revenue per block drops from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25. Eventually miners will no longer receive rewards at all and the impact of that is unknown.

Miners approve upgrades to the Bitcoin Platform. Even without the specter that many miners operate in China, miners have their own self-interests at heart. It isn’t clear those interests align with bitcoin holders, banks, or payment networks:

“Continuing its push to make cryptocurrency a mainstream payment option, PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Monday announced that it will accept cryptocurrency at checkout. The move builds on PayPal’s strategy of increasing the utility of cryptocurrency so it can become a mainstream payment option. PayPal took the first step in that direction last October when it allowed PayPal account holders to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their account. PayPal will support acceptance of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash, and will not charge consumers conversion or any other fees at checkout. Only one type of cryptocurrency can be used for each purchase. Once payment has been made, PayPal will settle the transaction in U.S. dollars and convert them to the applicable currency for the business at its standard conversion rates. Noting that acceptance of cryptocurrency as a payment option has been slow because consumers have historically treated the digital currency as an asset, PayPal sees the acceptance of cryptocurrency as a way to help merchants attract, and build loyalty among, new customers who want to pay for purchases using digital currencies.”

This “Checkout with Crypto” feature is new, but amassing your cryptocurrency horde on PayPal has been a possibility since November of last year. PayPal makes it painfully easy to buy cryptocurrency on its service, but there are a few caveats you’ll want to consider before you start using it to facilitate all of your transactions.

First, let’s go over the basics: Make sure you’re using the most up-to-date version of PayPal’s mobile app or, if you prefer to use your browser, simply hit up PayPal’s website. In either, you’ll see a big button that says “Crypto” on it. Click or tap on that.

You’ll also be charged a cryptocurrency “spread,” as PayPal describes:



“PayPal makes money when you buy and sell Crypto Assets. PayPal will charge a spread (or margin) between the market price we receive from our trading Service Provider and the exchange rate between USD and Crypto Assets displayed to you. PayPal charges a spread on every Crypto Asset transaction, including sales to Checkout with Crypto. The amount that PayPal makes and the exchange rate provided may be different than what you would pay on other cryptocurrency platforms. You will also be charged a fee when you buy or sell Crypto Assets. More information on pricing and fees can be found on the PayPal Fees page, the PayPal Cash Long Form Disclosure and the PayPal Cash Plus Long Form Disclosure. PayPal does not charge a fee to sell Crypto Assets when you Checkout with Crypto.”

When you use PayPal for crypto, you’re stuck with PayPal

The biggest quick of PayPal’s seemingly easy implementation is that once completed, your cryptocurrency purchases are locked into its system. You can’t transfer your assets to another service or wallet (or import any more in), nor is there any other protection you can use (like a private key) to gain access to your cryptocurrency in the event you run into problems with PayPal . You can’t even pay your friends in cryptocurrency, just supported merchants.

Everything you do is tied directly to your PayPal account, which means you’ll want to have strong security in place (including two-factor authentication) to protect your investment . And you’ll want to make sure that you never do anything on PayPal that runs afoul of its policies. I’m not sure what happens to your cryptocurrency if that happens , but that’s not really an issue you’d encounter on a service that only facilitates cryptocurrency buying and selling.

In other words, you’re getting the convenience of PayPal, but you’re also stuck with PayPal if you go this route to buy your Bitcoins (or whatever). Honestly, if you’re looking to seriously get into cryptocurrency, you might consider a different provider entirely—especially one that grants you the ability to buy and sell a much larger list of cryptocurrencies. PayPal’s version is kind of like the Robinhood of crypto, only easier. Use it to get your feet wet , sure, but you’ll want to move on to something a little more advanced as soon as you can. And that’ll mean liquidating your PayPal assets; here’s hoping you catch your favorite cryptocurrency on an upswing.","The move means that soon, clients of two of the world's preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April, CNBC was first to report .

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a ""full spectrum"" of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, ""whether that's through the physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles,"" she said.

"" We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,"" Rich said in an interview this week.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman's private wealth management division. Her promotion was scheduled to be announced Wednesday in an internal company memo seen by CNBC.

Goldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin's price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature.

In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich. Goldman's private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments with at least $25 million to invest.

""There's a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,"" Rich said. ""There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we're sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.""

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are ""more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,"" Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, while Galaxy's institutional bitcoin fund can be liquidated on a weekly basis.

Goldman is in the process of securing approvals from regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

""We're still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,"" Rich said. ""But I think it's fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.""

Goldman's move happened despite skepticism throughout the traditional banking industry. That includes at the New York-based bank itself: Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for Goldman's wealth management business, has repeatedly said that bitcoin isn't appropriate for investors.

Until roughly a year ago, bitcoin's market capitalization and trading volumes weren't large enough for big financial institutions to bother getting involved, Mike Novogratz, CEO-founder of crypto firm Galaxy Digital, said Wednesday in a CNBC interview.

""Adoption's happening faster than I predicted,"" Novogratz said. ""It's shocking to me how fast people are moving into the system.""

The largest cryptocurrency’s price over the past week has been pushing back up toward $60,000, and a breach of that crucial psychological level could trigger to a rally to a new all-time high, analysts said. The record price now sits at $61,557, reached earlier this month.

Prices have doubled so far in 2021, bitcoin’s best first-quarter performance in eight years.

In absolute dollar terms, bitcoin’s price jumped about $30,000 during the three-month period, well exceeding the cryptocurrency’s next-best quarter, a gain of about $22,000, during the fourth quarter of 2020. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large stocks, for comparison, is up about 5.7%. (Stocks rose Wednesday, with President Joe Biden set to unveil his next stimulus plan to follow the recent $1.9 trillion deal.)

Crypto lending firms including CoinDesk sister company Genesis and BlockFi are cutting the interest rates they pay on large-scale bitcoin deposits, potentially signaling an end to the glorified 4% to 6% levels that have served as a staple of the lucrative market.

Ether rose, after holding support around $1,800. The cryptocurrency is up about 30% for the month, versus a 25% gain in BTC.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space continued to grab headlines this week after Aave announced Wednesday that it will work with Ethereum layer 2 Polygon to bypass congestion on the blockchain network.","Phillipe Christodoulou wanted to check his bitcoin balance last month, so he searched the App Store on his iPhone for ""Trezor,"" the maker of a small hardware device he uses to store his cryptocurrency. Up popped the company's padlock logo set against a bright green background. The app was rated close to five stars. He downloaded it and typed in his credentials.

In less than a second, nearly all of his life savings -- 17.1 bitcoin worth $600,000 at the time -- was gone. The app was a fake, designed to trick people into thinking it was a legitimate app.

But Christodoulou is angrier at Apple than at the thieves themselves: He says Apple marketed the App Store as a safe and trusted place, where each app is reviewed before it is allowed in the store.

Christodoulou, once a loyal Apple customer, said he no longer admires the company. ""They betrayed the trust that I had in them,"" he said in an interview. ""Apple doesn't deserve to get away with this.""

Apple bills its App Store as ""the world's most trusted marketplace for apps,"" where every submission is scanned and reviewed, ensuring they are safe, secure, useful and unique. But in fact, it's easy for scammers to circumvent Apple's rules, according to experts.

Criminal app developers can break Apple's rules by submitting seemingly innocuous apps for approval. Once they're in the store, scammers can simply transform the apps into what amount to phishing apps that trick people into giving up their information, until Apple finds out and removes the app, according to Apple.

Crypto scams are also common on Google's Android and on the Web. But their presence on the Apple App Store is more surprising because Apple says it curates the store and checks each app, which creates high levels of consumer trust. The 15% to 30% commission Apple collects on all sales on the App Store goes to fund the ""highly curated"" customer experience, the company has said.

""User trust is at the foundation of why we created the App Store, and we have only deepened that commitment in the years since,"" said Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz. ""Study after study has shown that the App Store is the most secure app marketplace in the world, and we are constantly at work to maintain that standard and to further strengthen the App Store's protections. In the limited instances when criminals defraud our users, we take swift action against these actors as well as to prevent similar violations in the future.""

The ability of apps to morph into something else entirely after they are approved by the App Store raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple's review process to stop scammers. Apple wouldn't say how often these scams appear, or how often it removes them. But it did say it removed 6,500 apps for ""hidden or undocumented features"" last year.

Apple acknowledged that there have been other cryptocurrency scams on the App Store but wouldn't say how many. Apple wouldn't say why, when fake Trezor apps had sneaked into the App Store in the past, new apps called ""Trezor"" were not flagged as potentially fraudulent.

Coinfirm, a U.K. company that specializes in cryptocurrency regulations and conducts fraud investigations, says it has received more than 7,000 inquiries about stolen crypto assets since October 2019. Fake apps in Google's Android Play Store and Apple's App Store are common, said Pawel Aleksander, the company's chief information officer.

Coinfirm said five people have reported having cryptocurrency stolen by the fake Trezor app on iOS, for total losses worth $1.6 million. There have been three reports of fake Trezor apps on Android that stole a total of $600,000 in cryptocurrency.

Apple would not name the developer of the fake Trezor app or provide the developer's contact information. Apple wouldn't say whether it was turning over the name to law enforcement agencies or whether it investigated the developer further. Apple also wouldn't say whether that developer had developed any other apps in the past or had connections to other developer accounts under different names.

Google didn't say how the Trezor app made it onto the Google Play store. It said it knows of two fake Trezor apps that have appeared on the store. It removed both. The company didn't say whether it notified law enforcement agencies, or how many other scam apps it has found on the store.

Of all the internet scams, the theft of cryptocurrency is one of the most lucrative for thieves. Millions of dollars in digital currency can be pilfered in a split-second, and high-profile crypto heists have netted thieves as much as $530 million, which occurred in the Coincheck hack in 2018.","PayPal announced on Tuesday that it will be launching ""Checkout with Crypto,"" which allows users to pay with cryptocurrency when making purchases online.

The new feature will allow customers to securely pay online, converting cryptocurrency holdings to fiat currency at checkout.

""Fiat Currency is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it,"" PayPal said in a news release.

""As the use of digital payments and digital currencies accelerates, the introduction of Checkout with Crypto continues our focus on driving mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, while continuing to offer PayPal customers choice and flexibility in the ways they can pay using the PayPal wallet,"" said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal.

Customers will be able to use Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash, and PayPal will not charge any additional fees for choosing the cryptocurrency methods of payment.

""Enabling cryptocurrencies to make purchases at businesses around the world is the next chapter in driving the ubiquity and mass acceptance of digital currencies,"" Schulman added.

Bitcoin has gained wider acceptance from corporate America over the past year as investment firms have parked more cash into the digital space. BlackRock Inc. and Morgan Stanley are among the Wall Street firms that have begun to dabble in cryptocurrency.

Tesla Inc. announced in March that customers can pay for vehicles with bitcoin. The announcement came after the electric-car maker said in February it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin as a way to diversify its cash holdings.

Visa Inc. said on Monday it will allow customers to settle transactions on its payment network in cryptocurrency.

The credit card company will pilot the use of the stablecoin USD Coin to settle transactions over Ethereum, an open-source blockchain network. The program is being offered with the help of partner brokerage platform Crypto.com and the digital-asset bank Anchorage.

More partners are expected to be included in the program later this year.

Overstock.com also appears to accept bitcoin for most listings on its website, including cameras, vacuums and clothes.

Enterprise software provider MicroStrategy Inc. and digital payment company Square Inc. have also recently announced bitcoin purchases.

Millions of people joined Bitcoin's network in a quest for making a profit but also using it as a payment method due to the fact that it is completely optimized for online use and has tons of great benefits.

With all of this on our mind, we decided to dive into the world of Bitcoin and try to explain why this cryptocurrency is so superior compared to the competition. As you may know, there are countless cryptocurrencies on the market, but none of them even come close to Bitcoin. Let’s check out the reasons why.

It is Far More Valuable

It goes without saying that Bitcoins value completely dwarves the value of other cryptocurrencies. It recently managed to cross $50,000 for the first time in history, and that number is breath-taking. Just to let you know how much that is, Bitcoin is now as valuable as gold. Nothing has ever come close to gold’s value in history, yet Bitcoin did it with ease.

Speaking of its value and money, it is also interesting to mention the process of making money with Bitcoin. After traders manage to earn it through the process known as mining (in this process, you verify Bitcoin transactions), they visit trading sites to sell their assets. These sites are worth to take a look at as they are quite unique and interesting. Let’s take Bitcoin System UK as an example as this trading site is one of the most reputable on the market. Not only does this platform act as a marketplace, but it also uses AI to try and help you sell your Bitcoins at the perfect time. In layman’s terms, this AI system takes the data on Bitcoin from the market, analyzes it and manages to make an accurate prediction on how Bitcoin will fluctuate in the future.

In doing so, it provides you with valuable information as it helps you determine when is the best time to sell you Bitcoins and make the highest possible profit.

Provides Next-Level of Security

One of the common features that cryptocurrencies have is that they provide users with a certain level of anonymity. But, Bitcoin also takes the lead here as being the most secure cryptocurrency. The cryptology method that it uses manages to protect its users very effective and makes it impossible for unwanted parties to gain access to sensitive data.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that Bitcoin has never been hacked, which is a huge milestone.

The Network is Far More Stable

Earlier in this article, we mentioned that there are millions of users in Bitcoin’s network. Not only that, but thousands of new users join it daily. That makes Bitcoin far more stable than other cryptocurrencies. Its stability also leads many experts to believe that Bitcoin has the potential to become the global

universal payment method in the future. They stated that a point where a majority of the world’s population will use Bitcoin and governments will have no choice but to accept it.

What About Regular Payment Methods?

When comparing Bitcoin to the regular payment methods, we can see that it makes them look obsolete as it holds tons of advantages over them. The aforementioned security is one of those advantages, along with instant transactions and the fact that third parties are not involved in the process of trading.

Banks are excluded from the process of trading, and in doing so, they cannot impose any added or hidden fees. So, people are able to save money when using this cryptocurrency for payments.","The first quarter of 2021 was no doubt one of the most thrilling in bitcoin history. It started on a high note and closed it with the same vibe. Despite the periodic price drops that BTC experienced, Q1 of 2021 came out the best since Bitcoin’s inception. Historical data shows that Q2 has been even better, raising the question if bitcoin would be heading further north.

The Best Q1 Ever

The end of March signified the end of the first yearly quarter. Bitcoin ended the quarter with 100% gains, making it the best ever.

Various events made this year’s first three months interesting and bullish. On February 8th, Tesla announced a $1.5 billion bitcoin investment, and in March, the Elon Musk-led company started accepting BTC as a payment option.

As with Tesla’s purchase that pumped bitcoin to a high at the time, MicroStrategy kept purchasing as much BTC as possible without letting up.

More opportunities were also created for BTC HODLers to use it in their daily purchase. PayPal announced that its U.S. customers will be able to pay for goods using cryptocurrencies. Bakkt also helped enhance crypto users’ spending habits by partnering with some merchants to assist their customers in paying for products with cryptocurrencies. It was indeed a bullish first quarter.

Q2 Is Historically Bullish For Bitcoin

With Q1 over, we now look to face the second quarter of 2021. Looking at Bitcoin’s historical data, it is impossible not to see how well bitcoin has performed in Q2 of almost every year. Even at times when the preceding quarter was negative, the second always provides consolidation.

Since bitcoin started trading, only on one occasion did it record losses in the second quarter. That happened in 2018 when Q2 opened at $6,884 and closed at $6,385, representing a 7% drop in price. To date, that has been both the first and the last time Q2 recorded a quarterly loss.

Bitcoin averages a 59.82% gain in Q2. The highest increase during a second-quarter was in 2019 when the leading cryptocurrency surged by 157% after opening and closing at $4,112 and $10,591, respectively.

The massive gains recorded in the second quarter of 2019 were mostly buoyed by whales which took a keen interest in the asset and were able to pump it to over $10,000. Crypto exchanges also played a huge part in the 2019 Q2 milestone as margin trading became more accessible to traders, thus increasing trading volumes.

Will History Repeat Itself in Q2 2021?

If history is any indicator, the cryptocurrency could see even higher adoption levels in Q2, following the impressive performance in Q1. Starting with a possible surge in use cases as more payment companies could integrate crypto as a settlement option.

More publicly-traded firms and private institutions will be alerted to opportunities to invest in the so-called digital gold, following the example set by MicroStrategy, Tesla, MassMutual, and more.

Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street’s biggest names, plans to launch a full spectrum bitcoin investment vehicle for wealth management clients. More banks will likely follow the same path as Morgan Stanley and BNY Mellon are already leading the way.

The first quarter saw bitcoin hit a new all-time high. There is a good chance that the first-ever cryptocurrency will record a new record during the second quarter considering the historical data and the current developments.

Keeping in mind that bitcoin entered Q2 2021 at about $59,000, an increase of 60% (the average ROI in the past second-quarters) would take the asset to just above $94,000.","Chipotle is offering its customers a chance to win $200,000 worth of bitcoin and free burritos as part of a promotion for National Burrito Day.

“The premise is that we’ve lost our password to our account and if you enter in a correct code you can win either a free burrito or $500 in bitcoin all the way up to $25,000 in bitcoin,” Chipotle chief marketing officer Chris Brandt told FOX Business' Neil Cavuto on Thursday.

""Whenever we do one of these things, especially on a day like National Burrito Day, which we call kind of a ""Chipotday"", an informal national holiday, we always get a lot of great fan interest. So I would encourage everyone to get on sooner versus later if they can.”

However, he confessed that Chipotle has no plans in the near future to adopt bitcoin as a form of payment in its restaurants.

""We have no plans to do that right now, there’s a lot of complexities involved in that,"" Brandt said. ""But if you had told me a year ago that we'd be doing something with bitcoin I probably would’ve been skeptical about that as well. So in this world, never say never, but we have no plans to take it as currency.”

Digital sales have boomed for the restaurant chain during the coronavirus pandemic, with online transactions accounting for nearly half of Chipotle's total sales in 2020, compared to 20% of its total sales in 2019.

“We’re really hoping that we can hang onto a lot of those digital users, which were a lot of new users to Chipotle, as the in-restaurant business comes back,"" Brandt added.

However, what is tasty and not a joking matter is the total crypto market cap, which is nearing $2 trillion today.

Data by TradingView shows that on crypto exchange Bitstamp, the Bitcoin price hit $59,490, which is currently today’s intraday high, at 08:27 UTC.

According to data by CryptoCompare, currently (as of 11:01 UTC), Bitcoin is trading around $58,534, up 0.88% in the past 24-hour period; as for the year-to-date (YTD) period, Bitcoin has gone up 102.03% vs USD. Bitcoin’s market cap is approximately $1.09 trillion, the total market cap is around $1.92 trillion, which means that BTC Dominance is at 57%.

On Tuesday (March 30), Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle sent out this pair of tweets tweet:

https://t.co/VMdOHpnSpd 4/1 at 9am PST. See you there. — Chipotle (@ChipotleTweets) March 30, 2021

A few minutes earlier, Chipotle had issued a press release, in which it announced that “it will give away $100,000 in free burritos and $100,000 in Bitcoin to celebrate National Burrito Day.” It also pointed out this would make it “the first U.S. restaurant brand to offer a cryptocurrency giveaway to consumers.”

Apparently, Chipotle, in partnership with former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas (currently Founder and CEO of Coil), will launch a new interactive game called ‘Burritos or Bitcoin‘. The idea is for fans to “carry out a mock ‘chiptocurrency’ rescue mission and crack the code on its digital wallet.” It seems that each player will have 10 tries to “guess a valid six-digit code for a chance to win a free burrito or up to $25,000 in Bitcoin.”

The contest, which is available only in the U.S., goes live today (April 1) at 09:00 PT and ends at 6:00pm.","Billionaire investor Mark Cuban is bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and frequently compares blockchain technology to the early days of the internet.

That's why, over the years, Cuban held onto the few digital coins he bought in the ""early days,"" Cuban said on a recent episode of ""The Delphi Podcast."" Currently, his portfolio allocation is broken down as: ""60% bitcoin, 30% Ethereum and 10% the rest.""

Bitcoin, created in 2009, is the largest cryptocurrency by market value, but is appealing to Cuban as a store of value rather than a currency.

In 2012, ""people said bitcoin is a currency, and I'm like, 'It's just not going to work.' But, the entire time, I said it was a store of value where, if you could get people to believe that it was a better alternative than gold, because of its algorithmic scarcity, the price is going to go up,"" he said.

According to Cuban, bitcoin is ""a better alternative to gold, and it's going to continue [to be],"" he said. ""That's why I own bitcoin and why I never sold it.""

Cuban is also very interested in Ethereum — the blockchain where ether, the second largest cryptocurrency below bitcoin, is built — mainly due to the smart contracts that run on it. In cryptocurrency, smart contracts are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions and run on the blockchain.

""What really changed everything was smart contracts,"" Cuban said. ""Smart contracts came along, and that created DeFi [or decentralized finance] and NFTs [or nonfungible tokens]. That's what changed the game. That's what got me excited. That's why it's a lot like the internet.""","The last time Bitcoin saw six-monthly green candles in a row was in 2013

Bitcoin (BTC) price closed March in the green to record the sixth consecutive green candle on the monthly log. It is the first time the top cryptocurrency has achieved this since a similar run in 2012—2013.

The bullish streak has seen Bitcoin’s price break above $61,000, and confirmation of another monthly green candle could see it set another record over what is expected to be a bullish April.

At the moment, BTC/USD is trading near $59,000, with bulls focused on retaking control towards $60k after several near misses over the past few days.

BTC price monthly outlook

The last time BTC price recorded six bullish monthly candles in a row was in April 2013. At the time, BTC/USD had surged to a then all-time high of $260, having traded at lows of $10 in November 2012.

The upside was, however, followed by a 40% decline over two months, with BTC declining to around $90. A steady climb was followed by an explosive October and November that saw prices soar over 500% to cross $1000 for the first time.

Bitcoin price saw a similar trend in the months leading up to the 2017 bull market, though this time the top crypto had seen five bullish monthly candles in a row. Another decline followed the five-month bull run, before the next three candles included the rally that took BTC/USD to highs of $20,000.

Another bullish flip in 2019 saw five consecutive monthly green candles take Bitcoin from lows of $3,300 to highs of $14,000. But like in the previous instances, this too was followed by a steady price crash that hit a bottom in March 2020 when BTC sank to lows of $3,800.

The current bull market might be different given the institutional interest and massive merchant adoption led by the likes of PayPal. Thus, BTC/USD could break higher and reach forecast levels of $80,000 or more before retracing.

However, Bitcoin looks a little overstretched following the 2021 explosive run. The monthly RSI is in overbought territory and is extending above 90, which, in the past, preceded a significant correction.

In this case, the key price levels to watch are $60k and $50k. A breakout in either direction is likely to indicate where BTC trades over the next month or two.","Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said it’s planning to make its trading debut April 14.

The company’s registration statement for the listing has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase said Thursday in a statement confirming a Bloomberg News report.

The direct listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market had earlier been pushed back from March, Bloomberg previously reported. As with other direct listings, a reference price to help guide investors and to allow the shares to begin trading will be disclosed the night before the company goes public, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information was private.

Coinbase’s plans were undergoing a review by the SEC, which has been inundated with filings for initial public offerings, including the frenzy of special-purpose acquisition companies.

A different federal regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, announced March 19 that it had reached a $6.5-million settlement with Coinbase, resolving claims that the company had reported inaccurate data about transactions and that a former employee had engaged in improper trades.

Coinbase is planning to go public through a direct listing in which it will not raise any new capital, it said in previous filings. It was valued at about $90 billion in its final week of trading on Nasdaq’s private market, Bloomberg News reported.

The debut will be the first major direct listing to take place on Nasdaq. All such previous listings were on the New York Stock Exchange, including those by Spotify Technology, Slack Technologies Inc., Asana Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Roblox Corp.

2021-04-02,"The world’s second-most prominent crypto on Friday touched a fresh record above $2,100.

Ether ETHUSD, -7.40% , running atop the ethereum blockchain, were recently up 6% at around $2,087 after touching an all-time high at $2,105.68 Friday, according to CoinDesk. That is handily above its Feb. 20 record at $2,036.55 put.

Gains for the crypto, which is known for its ability to allow smart contracts to be coded into the ethereum protocol, comes as Visa Inc. V, +0.36% has become the first major payment platform to use USD Coin, a stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar, to settle crypto transactions over the ethereum blockchain.

Visa users will be able to exchange USD Coin over the credit card’s payment network to clear transactions made in fiat currency, a move that is viewed as bridging the gap between traditional currencies and crypto.

The move by the payment processor highlights growing use of decentralized finance applications, largely operating within the ethereum network, to create new, blockchain-related applications that take advantage of smart contracts.

Decentralized finance networks, or DeFi, enable users to conduct transactions without an intermediary and have widely been considered one of the most significant appeals of cryptographic assets.

“Over the last year, more than $45 billion worth of user funds have been locked into Ethereum-based applications that fall under this new DeFi category, which seeks to recreate traditional financial products in decentralized ways,” wrote Sergey Nazarov, the co-Founder of Chainlink, a gateway network that allows smart contracts to access real-time data outside their network.

The promise for the utility of smart contracts and DeFi have supported the view held by some that ethereum could one day rival bitcoin prices.

“Basically, there’s a decentralized Wall Street blooming on top of ethereum that’s currently growing faster than any other sector in the entire cryptocurrency industry, and it all requires ETH to function, likely explaining a good portion of the increased attention on the asset,” Nazarov said.

Meanwhile, bitcoin prices BTCUSD, -3.82% were seeing muted trade, changing hands at around $58,000, beneath its all-time high at $61,556.59, according to CoinDesk.

Optimism around bitcoin and the broader crypto sector has been centered on increased institutional adoption of digital assets as alternatives to gold and other commodities.

On top of that, a report late this week points to an initial public offering of Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, +3.70% , which plans to go public on April 14 under the ticker symbol “Coin” via a direct listing on the Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ, -1.23%

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban remains bullish on the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, often comparing blockchain technology to the internet's earliest days. He discussed his cryptocurrency portfolio on a recent episode of The Delphi Podcast.

Q4 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

Currently, Cuban's cryptocurrency portfolio consists of 60% bitcoin and 30% Ethereum. The remaining 10% of the portfolio consists of other digital currencies.

Mark Cuban on bitcoin

Cuban likes bitcoin and Ethereum for different reasons. He disagrees with those who said bitcoin is a currency because he doesn't think it will work. However, he does see it as a store of value and a better alternative to gold. Cuban believes bitcoin will continue to be a better alternative to gold, which is why he bought some and never sold it.

The owner of the Dallas Mavericks also likes Ethereum, but it's for a very different reason than why he likes bitcoin. He thinks ether is the closest coin to being a digital currency because of the smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. CNBC explains that smart contracts are collections of code that follow certain rules while running on the blockchain.

Cuban said smart contracts changed everything by creating decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens. He added that the technology is why he is excited about cryptocurrency and why he thinks it is ""a lot like the internet.""

The billionaire investor also believes Ethereum can be adapted over time because developers can improve its capabilities, which makes it more life-like. Cuban wishes he had bought some Ethereum sooner, but he started purchasing it four years ago because he thinks it is the closest to a true currency.

Cuban bought Dogecoin too

He didn't discuss any of the other cryptocurrencies he owns as the other 10% of his portfolio. However, he did say that there aren't any that he's ""just all in on, other than bitcoin and Ethereum"" as being an equivalent investment.

In February, he did purchase a small amount of dogecoin for his 11-year-old son. Dogecoin was started as a joke, and Cuban said when he bought some, it was meant to be ""fun and educational"" for his son while also enabling him to learn more about cryptocurrency.

Dogecoin has received a boost recently from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweets. When he initially started tweeting about the cryptocurrency, his tweets were meant to have been a joke, but that appears to have changed.

His most recent tweet about dogecoin proclaimed that SpaceX would ""put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon."" Some questioned whether that was a joke because he posted the tweet on April Fool's Day, but CNBC space reporter Michael Sheetz took him seriously because the company's first payload into orbit was a wheel of cheese.

The drama of cryptocurrency

As time has gone on, the cryptocurrency space has been marked with drama, from bitcoin's soaring price to the jokes surrounding the creation of dogecoin. More and more institutional investors have adopted the cryptocurrency, and some traditional investment banks are allowing their investors to buy some. Chipotle Mexican Grill even started a contest offering customers a chance to win $200,000 worth of bitcoin and free burritos to celebrate National Burrito Day.

Now the Youa Group is putting the drama of cryptocurrency to the small screen with a TV series called Pumping Time. The series will include some special episodes lasting up to 100 minutes and many regular episodes lasting up to 30 minutes.

It will also include some theatrical presentations. The series will include a variety of real-life situations involving cryptocurrency, including top cryptocurrency exchanges and funds. Well-known CEOs and celebrities in the crypto world will make cameo appearances. The series will also dive into questionable crypto tactics to teach the public about potential risks.","Ether , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, rose to a record high as the rally in digital assets continues to broaden beyond Bitcoin.

The digital token for the Ethereum network gained 6.2% on Friday and reached as high as $2,144 on Saturday. It has nearly tripled this year, and first topped $2,000 briefly on an intraday basis in February. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index gained about 3% Friday, while Bitcoin was little changed after more than doubling this year.

“The latest backing from Visa Inc. appears to be giving the bulls a new reason to persist in their stride,"" said Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO. The trend could send Ethereum above $2,100 in the coming days, he said.

Visa said this past week that its payments network will use USD Coin to settle transactions over Ethereum, which has helped boost sentiment. Also, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban’s comments about owning the digital asset and that it’s closest “to a true currency"" have increased interest, in addition to the ongoing upgrade of the network, according to Greg Waisman, co-founder and COO of the global payment network Mercuryo.

The token has mirrored the gains in Bitcoin over the past year amid a flood of stimulus aimed at boosting the global economy during the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics warn that crypto is a speculative bubble that will likely burst.

Crypto Coin Outperforming Bitcoin Is About to See Supply Reduced

Ether has a market value of about $230 billion, compared with about $1.1 trillion for Bitcoin, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.

“We’re now really breaking higher and that will very likely attract buying activity,"" said Julius de Kempenaer, senior analyst at StockCharts.com. “Ether is gaining in relative strength versus Bitcoin.""

Bitcoin was little changed, after briefly pushing above $60,000 earlier Friday but quickly finding selling pressure that brought the largest cryptocurrency’s price back down to about $58,900 as of press time.

“This could be an interesting weekend for bitcoin as much of the institutional money is expected to be dormant,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda. “Weekend volatility has been somewhat of a story this year, so many crypto watchers will look to see if any whales try to take advantage of illiquid conditions.”

Though bitcoin has roughly doubled in price this year, the gains have stalled around $60,000, despite continuing signs of growing mainstream adoption, including lofty price predictions from Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, and the brokerage firm BTIG.

JPMorgan issued a note Thursday arguing that bitcoin could fetch a long-term price of $130,000 if its volatility continues to decline. According to the bank, Bitcoin is becoming more appealing to institutions seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, Business Insider reported Thursday.

BTIG issued a “buy” rating on shares of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm and bitcoin storehouse. The firm’s analysts said their valuation was partly based on an assumption that BTC could rise to $95,000 by the end of 2022.

Bitcoin has been increasingly embraced by big investors as potential hedge against inflation, in the face of trillions of dollars of stimulus from governments and central banks around the world, attempting to jolt their coronavirus-racked economies.

Greg Cipolaro, head of research for the digital-asset manager NYDIG, wrote Friday in a weekly newsletter that he sees bitcoin “as an alternative to existing economic systems, which is why we think it has elicited so much interest, especially in the current easy money era.”

Ether jumped Friday to a new all-time high as the second-biggest cryptocurrency extended its winning streak to five days.

The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, ether traded as high as $2,097 around 20:41 UTC, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The price has rallied 24% this week in the wake of Visa’s decision to facilitate crypto-based settlements on the Ethereum network.

We are in a ""radically"" different bitcoin (BTC) market today, an analyst stressed, while JPMorgan strategists find that decreasing volatility is here to help institutional adoption.

Per the latest Market Intel report by Chainalysis' Chief Economist Philip Gradwell, the data collected in the research suggested that the bitcoin price is resilient above at least USD 50,000, that there is significant observed demand at high price levels, but also that the market has changed radically in recent months.

""Cryptocurrency prices have been volatile but resilient over the last two weeks, with the bitcoin price ranging from a low of just over [USD] 50k to a high of just under [USD] 60k, but ending the fortnight at a similar price level to the start, of above [USD] 58k,"" he said.

Chainalysis observed the amount of bitcoin held by 'whales', those who held at least BTC 1,000, and how much they had paid for it, but they also analyzed all entities holding bitcoin, and concluded that,

""Analyzing the cost of acquisition since 2016 demonstrates how radically the market has changed in the last few months, to one where there is likely to be a lot of demand from existing buyers to support high price levels. As long as existing buyers do not change their hypothesis on bitcoin, it is likely that the price will be resilient above at least [USD] 50k.""

While, by March 29, BTC 8.4m were last acquired for less than USD 10,000 each, BTC 0.1m were acquired for more than USD 57,626 - these holders had made a USD loss but were still holding. Furthermore, said Gradwell, BTC 5.6m were bought for more than USD 30,000 and continue to be held, as well as BTC 3.1m at more than USD 40,000, and BTC 1.6m at more than USD 50,000.

Source: Chainalysis

Additionally, with the rapid price increase since November, from USD 15,000 to the all-time high of above USD 61,000, came the significant acquisition of bitcoin across many groups, resulting in the bitcoin cost curve to shift up significantly for 8m of the BTC 18.7m supply - meaning that the cost basis for many BTC is now ""radically higher"" than just a few months ago, ""demonstrating that a broad swath of market participants are willing to buy and hold at much higher prices than previously.""

Cost curves were relatively low in 2016 and early 2017, as the price of BTC had been relatively low. Despite jumping in the meantime, the cost curves changed relatively slowly and remained close together, according to the analyst. But the two most recent cost curves, for January 4 and March 29, have jumped much higher than any in the past and very rapidly.

Antoni Trenchev, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of major crypto lender Nexo, also claims that ""bitcoin is showing resilience like no other asset as it enters the rally-inducing part of its four-year economic cycle.""

""It’s totally uninterested in dollar action, Treasury Yields, tech stocks dropping, gold slipping, you name it. With PayPal allowing 29M merchants to accept crypto and Visa effectively becoming an Ethereum layer 2 by adding USDC as a settlement currency, I have no doubt that this bull run is far from over and that we are on track for further BTC support above [USD] 60K,"" he said in an emailed comment.

However, as just USD 1.4bn has been spent to acquire BTC 770,000 at more than USD 55,000, Gradwell warns that this is a relatively weaker price level, and that if more dollars are spent to acquire BTC above this price level, then it will likely become firmer, and vice versa.

Volatility decline = stronger interest

Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere, is quoted by The Independent as saying that after a recent epic BTC rally, this momentum has been slowing down and the ""temporary bitcoin price slowdown could trigger a new surge in institutional investment, leading to prices going up permanently.""

And this could be helped by the drop in price volatility.

While high BTC price volatility ""acts as a headwind towards further institutional adoption,"" it has been on the decline in recent weeks, making BTC more appealing to institutions, strategists at JPMorgan said, as reported by Market Insider.

Bloomberg reported the investment bank's strategists saying that three-month realized volatility has fallen to 86% after rising above 90% in February. The six-month measure appears to be stabilizing at around 73%.

A jump in institutional adoption is ""likely to arise from the recent change in the correlation structure of bitcoin relative to traditional asset classes,"" which have shifted lower in recent months, the bank explained, ""making bitcoin a more attractive option for multi-asset portfolios for diversification point of view and less vulnerable to any further appreciation in the dollar.""

Some of the attention BTC received in the past two quarters has come at the expense of gold, they said, citing USD 7bn of inflows into BTC funds and USD 20bn of outflows from exchange-traded funds tracking gold. ""Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an 'alternative' currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,"" JPMorgan said, adding:

""A convergence in volatilities between bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly and is likely a multi-year process. This implies that the above [USD] 130,000 theoretical bitcoin price target should be considered as a long-term target.""

PayPal lets US users buy, sell, or hold Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

You'll need $1 to get started, and transaction fees and exchange rates (including spread fees) will apply.

PayPal's newly launched ""Checkout with Crypto"" feature allows investors to use crypto as payment.

Click here to get started with PayPal's cryptocurrency services.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. is an electronic money transfer platform offering financial services to consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets around the globe.

Its cryptocurrency services have been available since 2020, but in March, PayPal expanded those offerings with its launch of the ""Checkout with Crypto"" service.

As long as you're a PayPal user with crypto assets in the US, you can buy, sell, hold, and/or checkout with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

How to invest with PayPal

In order to purchase cryptocurrencies, you'll have to complete a one-time Crypto registration process.

To invest in crypto using the PayPal app:

Click on ""crypto"" from your PayPal dashboard

Hit the ""buy"" button (PayPal will ask you to verify your identity)

If you're still uncertain about crypto and PayPal's offerings, you can review its educational articles to learn more.

Another thing to note is that you can only hold cryptocurrencies you've purchased through PayPal. You can't currently transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of your account.

PayPal also has maximum dollar limits for crypto transactions. There's a $20,000 maximum dollar limit for weekly crypto purchases and a $50,000 limit for purchases over a 12-month period, according to PayPal.

PayPal: Account custody considerations

Though PayPal says that you own each cryptocurrency you buy on the platform, it doesn't offer private keys for those assets. In the world of cryptography and crypto wallets, private keys function as heavily encrypted access codes that give you protected access to all of your crypto products.

Crypto services Electrum and Coinbase both offer private keys, which are one of two keys that popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rely on when it comes to transactions. The other is a public key. As the name implies, public keys are publicly known and typically used for identification purposes.

Part of the allure of private keys in cryptocurrency investing is that — like a personal bank account number — they protect your assets from being compromised. A public key doesn't mean the public get access to your assets; it just allows PayPal to access your cryptocurrency holdings in order to execute trades and purchases. However, this means that should PayPal's security be compromised, so could any cryptocurrency assets it has permission to access.

Though PayPal offers buyer protection on cryptocurrency transactions, its no-private-key rule could be a downside for those who want complete custody over the crypto assets they buy, sell, or hold through PayPal.

PayPal cryptocurrency investing features

Cryptocurrencies are virtual assets that utilize a highly encrypted blockchain technology. These assets are also commonly used as forms of payment for goods or services, but they're heavily volatile since their prices rapidly fluctuate. PayPal currently offers four types: Bitcoin (including Bitcoin Cash), Ethereum, and Litecoin.

While you won't have to pay fees for simply holding crypto in your account, you'll need at least $1 to get started. PayPal also charges the following transaction fees (these vary based on purchase amount):

$1-$24.99 purchase amount: $0.50 USD

$25-$100 purchase amount: 2.30%

$100.01-$200 purchase amount: 2.00%

$200.01-$1000.01 purchase amount: 1.80%

$1000.01+ purchase amount: 1.50%

For instance, if you bought $75 worth of Bitcoin, you'd have to pay a 2.30% asset-based transaction fee. However, there are also other fees involved.

PayPal charges a spread, or margin, between the market price it earns from its trading service provider and the exchange rate between USD and crypto assets shown to each customer. The company says this ""spread"" fee applies to all crypto transactions, including its new Checkout with Crypto service.

PayPal will disclose both the applicable exchange rate and the spread (typically 0.50%) for each transaction, according to its website.

Fees also apply for personal transactions or transfers where currency conversions are involved. Right now, only customers in the US and US territories (excluding Hawaii) can buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies on PayPal.

Is PayPal the right crypto platform for you?

This depends on your preferences. PayPal could be a good option for existing customers who regularly use the platform for money transfers and other services. Whether you're using cash or crypto, you can hold either in your account without any additional charges.

But note that PayPal's new checkout feature doesn't actually let you pay with cryptocurrencies. The new service converts your existing crypto assets into US dollars to complete any purchases.

Another thing to keep in mind is that PayPal charges small transaction fees (you can think of them as mini commissions) and exchange rates (including spread fees) when you buy or sell cryptocurrencies.

Additional considerations: PayPal's selection of cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (including Bitcoin Cash), Ethereum, and Litecoin — might be limited for investors looking for a wider range of cryptocurrencies or other securities like stocks or ETFs.

Coinbase Global Inc, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, has received approval from regulators to list its shares on the Nasdaq, paving the way for a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates.

The decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is another boost to the legitimacy of digital currencies, which are rapidly gaining acceptance from the mainstream financial services industry.

Earlier this week, Visa said it would allow the use of the cryptocurrency USD Coin to settle transactions on its payment network, while PayPal started allowing US consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay its millions of global online merchants.

A successful listing for Coinbase would mark a significant endorsement for a sector that has struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors, regulators and the general public.

Coinbase said in a blogpost that its shares were declared effective by the SEC earlier on Thursday. The company, which plans to go public through a direct listing, expects its shares to start trading on the Nasdaq on April 14.

In a direct listing, no shares are sold in advance, as is the case with an initial public offering (IPO). The company’s share price is determined by orders coming into the stock exchange. Advocates argue it is a better way to price new stock rather than an IPO.

In a regulatory filing last month, Coinbase said its stock in the private market traded at a weighted average price of $343.58 in the first quarter of 2021 through March 15, a nearly 13-fold jump in its valuation to around $68 billion in the space of a few months.

The surge in Coinbase’s private market valuation illustrates how the perceived value of the company has rallied hand-in-hand with the jump in the price of cryptocurrency bitcoin.","This week was undoubtedly bullish in the cryptocurrency market. The major coins saw serious increases. The same is true for small-cap cryptocurrencies, as the notion of a booming altcoin season is strengthening.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is up by a strong 15.8% this week as the cryptocurrency starts to push back toward the $60,000 level. It found support at the 50-day MA last week, at around $50,200, and started to rebound.

Throughout the course of the week, Bitcoin managed to push higher as it broke above $55,000 and the 50-day MA on Monday. It continued increasing until reaching as high as $60,100 today. It has since dropped slightly as it trades around $59,550.

Looking ahead, once Bitcoin reclaims $60,000, the first level of resistance will be located at the ATH price of $61,780. Beyond the ATH, resistance lies at $62,400 (1.272 Fib Extension), $63,766 (1.414 Fib Extension), $65,000, and $65,720 (1.618 Fib Extension).

On the other side, the first support lies at $58,355. This is followed by $57,500, $56,600 (20-day MA), $54,675 (.382 Fib), and $52,470 (.5 Fib).

Ethereum

Ethereum saw a stronger 26.3% price hike this week as it makes its way back toward $2000. The cryptocurrency was trading inside a short-term symmetrical triangle pattern at the beginning of the week as it rebounded from the lower boundary at around $1600.

On Monday, ETH managed to push above the 50-day MA to reach the upper boundary of the triangle. It was finally penetrated on Wednesday, and ETH continued above the March highs of $1944 yesterday. Today, it increased beyond $1960 to breach $2000, where it currently trades.

Looking ahead, the first level of resistance lies at the ATH price of $2056. This is closely followed by $2060 (1.414 Fib Extension – blue), $2100, and $2140 (1.272 Fib Extension). Added resistance lies at $2210 (1.414 Fib Extension) and $2300 (1.618 Fib Extension).

On the other side, the first level of support lies at $1960. This is followed by $1900, $1830 (.382 Fib), $1740 (50-day MA), and $1650.

Ethereum also started to perform well against Bitcoin. For the majority of the month, ETH had been struggling against BTC but managed to find support at 0.03 BTC, forming the floor of a descending triangle pattern.

This triangle was penetrated on Wednesday when Ethereum managed to break past the December 2020 highs at 0.0318 BTC. Since then, ETH crept higher to reach the current resistance around 0.0337 BTC, provided by the November 2020 highs.

Looking ahead, once the buyers break 0.0337 BTC, the first level of resistance lies at 0.035 BTC (March 2021 resistance). This is followed by 0.0361 BTC (March 2019 highs), 0.0385 BTC (bearish .5 Fib Retracement), and 0.0396 BTC (Feb 2019 Highs).

On the other side, the first support lies at 0.033 BTC. This is followed by 0.0318 BTC (December 2020 Highs), 0.03 BTC, and 0.0295 BTC.

Binance Coin

BNB is up by a whopping total of 48.2% over the past week as it currently battles the $348.66 resistance. It created a fresh ATH price today of $357 but seems is showing some weakness at a 1.414 Fib Extension, where it currently trades.

The coin rebounded from $235 at the start of the week and had been pushing higher ever since. It managed to create a fresh high-day closing price on Tuesday and continued upward from there to make the new ATH today.

Looking ahead, once the buyers break $348 and $350, the first level of strong resistance lies at $380 (1.618 Fib Extension – blue). This is followed by $400, $410, $425, and $440 (1.414 Fib Extension).

On the other side, the first support lies at $326. This is followed by $300 (.236 Fib), $263 (.382 Fib), $250, and $236.65 (.5 Fib).

Binance Coin is also performing well against Bitcoin but is still yet to create fresh ATHs. At the start of the week, BNB was trading inside a descending triangle pattern with the floor of the triangle at 0.00453 BTC (.5 Fib).

The coin finally broke toward the upside of the consolidation pattern on Tuesday and managed to pass the March 2020 high of 0.0055 BTC yesterday. Today, BNB pushed as high as 0.00606 BTC but is currently facing resistance at 0.00582 BTC.

Moving forward, once 0.00582 BTC is penetrated, the first resistance lies at 0.006 BTC. This is followed by 0.00634 BTC (1.414 Fib Extension), 0.0065 BTC (ATH Price), and 0.00671 BTC.

On the other side, the first support lies at 0.0056 BTC (.236 Fib). This is followed by 0.005 BTC (.382 Fib), 0.00453 BTC (.5 Fib), and 0.00406 BTC (.618 Fib).

Cardano

ADA saw a respectable 10.6% price hike this week as it currently trades at $1.21. The cryptocurrency rebounded from an ascending trend line at around $1.05 at the beginning of the week and pushed higher over the weekend to reach as high as $1.28.

However, throughout the course of the week, ADA has struggled to produce a closing candle above $1.22 and has traded inside a narrow range between $1.22 and $1.16 (20-day MA).

Looking ahead, if the buyers can create a daily closing candle above $1.22, the first resistance lies at $1.30. This is followed by $1.37 (1.414 Fib Extension), $1.46 (1.618 Fib Extension & March high), and $1.52.

On the other side, the first support lies at $1.16 (20-day MA). This is followed by $1.10 (ascending trend line), $1.00 (50-day MA), and $0.95 (.5 Fib).

Against Bitcoin, Cardano fell slightly as it battles to stay above 2000 SAT. The cryptocurrency has been trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern for the entire period of March as it fails to break the resistance at the upper boundary of the triangle.

Moving forward, the first level of resistance lies at the upper boundary of the triangle, around 2150 SAT. This is followed by 2300 SAT, 2455 SAT (July 2018 High-day closing price), and 2645 SAT (bearish .618 Fib).

On the other side, the first support lies at the lower boundary of the triangle at 2000 SAT. This is followed by 1950 SAT (downside 1.272 Fib Extension), 1800 SAT (.618 Fib), and 1600 SAT (July 2020 High).

Polkadot

DOT saw an exciting week in which it managed to increase by 28.7% to reach the current $38.35 level. The cryptocurrency had found support at $30 at the beginning of the week after rebounding from support at $27.67 (.382 Fib) last Thursday.

Throughout the week, DOT started to grind higher until reaching the resistance at $38.35 today. The cryptocurrency had struggled to produce a daily closing candle above $38 throughout the entire period of March, and a closing candle above this would signal that DOT is ready to head back to the ATH prices.

Looking ahead, the first resistance above $38.35 lies at $40. This is closely followed by $42.50 (ATH price), $45.57 (1.272 Fib Extension), $47.50, and $50.

On the other side, the first support lies at $35. This is followed by $32.70 (.236 Fib), $30, and $27.67 (.382 Fib).

Polkadot is showing some promise against Bitcoin as it managed to break above a descending trend line that had suppressed the market during the entire period of March. The coin had found support at 0.00057 BTC during the week and pushed higher on Wednesday to break above the 2020 highs at 0.0006 BTC and push above the descending trend line.

Since the break, DOT has slowly pushed higher a little but is yet to close a daily candle above 0.00065 BTC.

Moving forward, once DOT clears 0.00065 BTC, the first resistance lies at 0.000685 BTC (1.272 Fib Extension). This is followed by 0.0007 BTC, 0.00762 BTC, and 0.0008 BTC.

On the other side, the first support lies at 0.0006 BTC (2020 highs). This is followed by 0.00057 BTC, 0.00055 BTC (100-days EMA), and 0.0005 BTC (.5 Fib).",
2021-04-03,"Bitcoin, BTC to USD, slid by 3.29% on Saturday. Reversing a 0.39% gain from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $57020.0.

A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a late morning intraday high $59,841.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $60,000, Bitcoin slid to a final hour intraday low $56.872.0.

Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $58,128 and the second major resistance level at $57,297.

Finding late support, Bitcoin moved back through to $57,000 levels to reduce the deficit on the day.

In spite of the move back through to $57,000 levels, Bitcoin failed to break back through the second major support level.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the March gain. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $26,041 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Saturday.

Polkadot rallied by 4.17% to buck the trend on the day.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-8.66%), Chainlink (-9.83%), and Litecoin (-7.60%) led the way down.

Binance Coin (-4.87%), Cardano’s ADA (-2.42%), Ethereum (-5.86%), and Ripple’s XRP (-4.53%) also struggled

Crypto.com Coin ended the day flat, however.

In the current week, the crypto total market fell to a Monday low $1,671bn before rising to a Saturday high $1,932bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,802bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Wednesday high 61.34% before falling to a Saturday low 57.79%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 58.86%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.66% to $56,642.2. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $57,030.0 to a low $56,550.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a bearish start to the day.

At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was down by 6.50% to lead the way down.

Story continues

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move through the pivot level at $57,911 to bring the first major resistance level at $58,950 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from $58,500 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $59,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at 14th March swing hi $61,699.0 before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $60,880.

Failure to move through the $57,911 pivot would bring the first major support level at $55,981 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$55,000 support levels. The second major support level sits at $54,942.

Investment oi-Sneha Kulkarni

Bitcoin appears to be on its way to recovery following a sharp pullback at the end of last week. On Thursday 28th March the pullback started. The day before, Bitcoin peaked just over $57K, with Bitcoin's price dropping to almost $51K at the end of the day on Thursday. As the digital asset rally spreads across bitcoin, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, is hitting new highs. On Friday, the Ethereum network's digital token gained 6.2%, reaching a high of $2,144 on Saturday.

According to CoinMarketCap.com, Ether has a market value of around $230 billion, compared to about $1.1 trillion for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been steadily increasing in value. The rise appears to have been aided by the news this week that both Visa and Paypal intend to deepen their involvement in the crypto world.

We continue to hear good news about institutional adoption, such as Goldman Sachs' intentions to give wealth to clients and the continued filings and approvals of ETFs in Canada and Brazil, as well as filings in the United States.

On Thursday, JPMorgan issued a note arguing that if bitcoin's volatility continues to decline, it could fetch a long-term price of $130,000. According to Business Insider, Bitcoin is becoming more appealing to institutions looking for low-correlation assets to diversify their portfolios.

Morgan Stanley disclosed in an SEC filing on March 31 that 12 of its existing institutional funds could gain exposure to Bitcoin through cash-settled futures and investments with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

After all, as the US continues to implement COVID stimulus, the USD's status as the world's default currency may be impeded.

There's still some debate over whether Bitcoin is a real ""hedge against inflation,"" but there's more BTC buy and sell than ever before by more investors, and particularly by the institutions.","An under-the-radar Bitcoin whale just relocated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC as the flagship cryptocurrency moves to break its all-time high.

According to distributed ledger explorer Blockchain.com, an unknown entity transferred 11,999 BTC worth $703 million in an instant for a fee of $571.

The sending wallet, which was created in December 2018 and received substantial amounts of BTC in the same month, was ranked as the 60th largest BTC address prior to the transaction, according to BitInfoCharts.

The massive BTC stash was subsequently moved in a flurry of transactions with varying amounts of BTC.

So far, the cryptocurrency does not appear to be heading to any known crypto exchange addresses, where it could be sold on the open market. Since none of the addresses have been identified, it’s unknown if the BTC belongs to an early investor or an institution managing large sums of crypto.

The big-time whale transaction comes amid what on-chain data analyst Willy Woo calls a “supply shock,” suggesting that the next leg up in the bull market is approaching.

“We can see this from tracking the flows of coins out of the exchanges, where typically people speculate or buy and sell their coins, and they have a set inventory, some of which is allocated for speculation. We’ve just seen an unprecedented amount of depletion of that inventory.

If you look back in the 2017 bull market, we saw like a five month depletion of inventory, and that was enough to propel the bull market of 2017 right up to the $20,000 [mark] from what initially was about $1,000 to $1,500 when the inventory depletion ended, and now we’re in this zone of the Lehman’s 12 months of inventory depletion.”

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,521 according to CoinGecko.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Oliver Denker","Binance’s crypto derivatives platform Binance Futures continues to soar in popularity as more and retail customers add fuel to the bull run.

Open interest on the derivatives platform hit a record high of over $10 billion on Saturday, amounting to year-on-year growth of nearly 3,900%, according to data source CoinGecko.

The spike in open interest or the value of derivative contracts traded but not settled with offsetting positions reflects an increased inflow of money into the market.

Some analysts consider Binance synonymous with retail traders. In their newsletter dated Feb. 26, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode’s founders Jan Happel and Jann Allemann cited increased signups at Binance relative to the U.S.-regulated Coinbase exchange as evidence of increased retail participation.

Binance Futures was launched in September 2019 with a single tether (USDT)-margined perpetual futures for bitcoin.

Since then, the derivatives platform has expanded its product suite to over 180 pairs – 107 USDT- or Binance USD (BUSD)-margined futures contracts, 34 coin-margined futures, 36 Binance leveraged tokens, and six options, the exchange’s representative told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

Binance is the largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest at press time, contributing $4.33 billion, or 18.44%, of the global tally of $23.48, as per data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.","Shortly after getting a court authorization to obtain records of cryptocurrency exchange Circle’s customers, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is now seeking to get access to similar data from trading platform Kraken.

“Those who transact with cryptocurrency must meet their tax obligations like any other taxpayer,” said acting assistant attorney general David Hubbert of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, adding, “The Department of Justice will continue to work with the IRS to ensure that cryptocurrency owners are paying their fair share of taxes.”

Earlier this week, a federal court in Massachusetts approved the IRS’s request to serve a John Doe summons on “Circle Internet Financial Inc., or its predecessors, subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, including Poloniex LLC (collectively ‘Circle’).”

With this move, the IRS wants to identify the U.S. taxpayers who transferred $20,000 or more via transactions that involved cryptocurrencies between 2016 and 2020. According to the regulator, it needs the exchanges’ documents to check if those crypto traders are paying their taxes in full.

“Tools like the John Doe summons authorized today send the clear message to U.S. taxpayers that the IRS is working to ensure that they are fully compliant in their use of virtual currency,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig, adding:

“The John Doe summons is a step to enable the IRS to uncover those who are failing to properly report their virtual currency transactions. We will enforce the law where we find systemic non-compliance or fraud.”

Kraken is next in line

After Circle, the Department of Justice has filed a similar request for the tax regulator with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking to reveal customer records from Kraken.

However, this time around, the court denied the initial filing, arguing that it is “overboard” and the IRS needs to narrow down its request, The Block reported yesterday.

Namely, the court stated that “complete user preferences,” “any other records of Know-Your-Customer due diligence,” and “correspondence between Kraken and the User or any third party with access to the account pertaining to the account” are all too “broad categories of information.”

The judge’s order reportedly said:

“Any such response must specifically address why each category of information sought is narrowly tailored to the IRS’s investigative needs, including whether requests for more invasive and all-encompassing categories of information could be deferred until after the IRS has reviewed basic account registration information and transaction histories.”

Now, the IRS has until April 14 to refile a new “narrowly tailored” version of its request.

The reality is more complicated than that, and bitcoin outflows in 2021 have a lot more to do with another important digital asset: stablecoins.

But first, how we got here: The crypto industry still isn’t happy about FinCEN’s proposal to require crypto exchanges to collect data on both sides of any outflow transactions. Now, crypto advocates have a civil liberties group taking their side in comments on the proposal. That caused me to wonder, just how much money are we talking about?

Value of bitcoin flowing out of exchange wallets Source: Coin Metrics

The chart above shows the estimated notional value of bitcoin flowing out of exchange wallets, summed by month. The real number is probably larger. Notably, Coinbase goes to greater lengths than most exchanges to disguise its bitcoin addresses and therefore the largest U.S.-accessible exchange by volume is almost certainly undercounted here.

However, $60 billion a month is nothing to sneeze at. It’s no wonder regulators are paying attention to these flows.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

Much of the increase in outflows is due to bitcoin’s extraordinary Q1 price run. It was a record first quarter for the orange coin. Historically, for whatever reason, the first quarter has been a weak one, with negative returns in five of the past seven years, according to CoinDesk Research. In 2021, bitcoin rose 103% on the quarter.

That’s not the whole story, however. Last week saw another record: a single-day high-water mark in bitcoin-denominated outflows, with 1,365 BTC transferred off exchanges in a 24-hour period.

Some interpret these transfers bullishly: bitcoiners moving their exchange bitcoin into cold storage. Crypto analyst Willy Woo calls these hodlers “Rick Astleys” because the U.K. pop singer’s chart-topping 1987 single, “Never Gonna Give You Up,” aptly describes their feelings about bitcoin. But as I said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” show on Friday, it’s possible that they are Stevie Wonders. Meaning, they’re “Part-Time Lover(s).”

Here’s what I mean by that: One of the underlying market dynamics of the past three years has been the rise of stablecoins. Tether (USDT), in particular, has replaced bitcoin as the dominant quote currency of crypto altcoin trading. What that means is, when I want to use crypto to buy crypto on an exchange, I’m much more likely to be doing that in tether or, to a limited extent, USD coin (USDC), Circle’s dollar-pegged stablecoin.

Quote currency volumes: stablecoins vs. bitcoin

What we’re looking at here is quote currency volumes, the volume of markets priced in bitcoin and the top two stablecoins for the top four altcoins: ether, cardano, chainlink and stellar, on three exchanges included in TradeBlock’s bitcoin XBX index, plus Binance. So, this is a sample of the market, but a significant one. (TradeBlock is owned and operated by CoinDesk, and its XBX index is drawn from the most liquid exchanges that are accessible to U.S. investors. I’m using Binance as a reliable proxy for the rest of the world.)

As the chart shows, by the beginning of 2020 a flippening had occurred, with stablecoins already replacing bitcoin as the dominant crypto quote currency. Since then, tether and USDC have continued to eat up a growing share of quote currency volume, replacing bitcoin more and more. Bitcoin’s quote volume is now down to 12% versus the two largest stablecoins. And so, increasing bitcoin outflows reflect that trend as much as anything else: as volume moves from markets quoted in bitcoin to markets quoted in tether, exchange wallet balances reflect that move.

In other words, when it comes to the popular narrative of bitcoin outflows as a bullish signal of hodler activity, I think that’s a story dreamed up by the Doobie Brothers: it’s “What a Fool Believes.” I tend to lean more toward Tina Turner on this metric, wondering, “What’s Love Got to Do With It“? My advice to investors would be to stay like Daryl Hall & John Oates, and keep their “Private Eyes” watching this market closely.","Bobby Lee said the history of bitcoin was one of bubbles bursting and growing again Dado Ruvic/Reuters

Bitcoin investors need to be more aware of the asset's history of big booms and busts, Bobby Lee said.

The crypto exchange founder said bitcoin is likely to shoot up further but then crash dramatically.

Yet Lee said he is optimistic about bitcoin long-term, seeing it as an inflationary hedge.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Bitcoin investors should be more aware of the asset's volatile history of bubbles and dramatic price crashes, crypto exchange founder Bobby Lee has said.

Lee told Insider that bitcoin's history suggests it will continue shooting up but then is likely to crash dramatically ""within a few hours."" He said bitcoin may rapidly lose 50% of its value and could then fall further over the coming years.

Bitcoin has soared in 2021, touching an all-time high of close to $62,000 in March, after falling below $4,000 in the same month a year earlier.

Analysts said the huge amounts of money pumped into economies by governments and central banks - which have supported asset prices across the board - have been a key driver.

Lee said bitcoin could potentially go to $300,000 in the latest bull market cycle. The cofounder of BTCC, one of the oldest crypto exchanges, said he's attracted to bitcoin as a store of value at a time when fiat currencies risk losing value due to monetary stimulus.

Yet, the entrepreneur, who has recently written a book about bitcoin, said buyers should be more aware of the digital asset's hugely volatile past.

""A lot of investors are getting in without knowing the history,"" he said. ""That's just life, right? People buy real estate, not knowing the history of real estate bubbles, people buy stocks, not knowing about the history of stock market bubbles.""

He added: ""Bitcoin history has shown that not only has it risen really fast, but after every bubble, the bubble bursts, after every bull market, the bubble does burst and it quickly falls.""

Lee said bitcoin could fall 50% rapidly, ""and then it'll be a bear market for the next two, three years."" At times, it could even fall as much as 90% from previous highs, he said.

""When bitcoin winter comes, when it crosses the 50% sell-off, that's when people lose conviction and then people panic. They sell, and that's what causes it to go down even further and sit at that low level for two or three years.""

Yet, Lee said he remained optimistic about bitcoin. ""We just have to have the mental fortitude to hold onto it, what they call HODL... hold on for dear life."" He predicted it could even hit $1 million if it continues to go through boom-and-bust cycles.

Bitcoin continues to sharply divide the financial world, although many investors and institutions have been drawn to the cryptocurrency's remarkable rally. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Tesla are some of the major corporations to get involved.

However, bitcoin skeptics argue that bitcoin's massive volatility means its institutional adoption will be limited. Many argue its rise has been driven by huge amounts of stimulus and could falter once people return to normal life and spending patterns after the coronavirus pandemic.

They say it is set for a price crash similar to after 2017, when bitcoin plunged below $4,000 from about $20,000 in just over a year.","JPMorgan, one of the largest investment banks in the world, mentioned in a note that the $130,000 theoretical Bitcoin price target should be considered a long-term target. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is currently trading near $58,000 with a market cap of more than $1.08 trillion.

According to the research note, the recent decline in Bitcoin’s volatility is attracting institutional investors. The bank highlighted that the price of BTC at $130,000 would match the total private sector investment in gold.

Looking Forward to Meeting You at iFX EXPO Dubai May 2021 – Making It Happen!

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JPMorgan, published a research note in February 2021 and mentioned that Bitcoin’s volatility is a massive issue for large organizations. The bank previously issued a long-term price target of $146,000 for Bitcoin.

In the latest note, JPMorgan said that the bank’s long-term price target of $130,000 for Bitcoin is predicated on the idea that BTC’s volatility will converge with gold.

“Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an alternative currency implies big upside for Bitcoin over the long term. A convergence in volatilities between bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly and is likely a multi-year process. This implies that the above $130,000 theoretical BTC price target should be considered as a long-term target,” JPMorgan mentioned in the note.

Bitcoin and Gold

Institutional investors around the world have started considering Bitcoin as an alternative to gold. Despite the reason that BTC’s market cap is relatively smaller than gold, consistent outflows were reported in gold-related investment products during the last few months, and strong inflows were reported in the world’s largest digital currency over the same period. Bitcoin recently crossed the 10% market cap of mined gold.

In a Redditt post, Ray Dalio, an American Hedge Fund Manager and Founder of Bridgewater Associates, said that Bitcoin and other digital currencies have established themselves as interesting gold-like asset alternatives in the last 10 years.","The financial giant is gradually becoming more bullish on Bitcoin and institutional adoption.

JPMorgan, in an email note released to clients on Thursday, cited decreasing Bitcoin volatility as a positive for institutional interest in the asset. In an article covering the release by Bloomberg, strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou at JPMorgan wrote:

“These tentative signs of Bitcoin volatility normalization are encouraging… In our opinion, a potential normalization of Bitcoin volatility from here would likely help to reinvigorate the institutional interest going forward.”

On the basis of Bitcoin’s declining long term volatility, the strategists revised their Bitcoin price target to align with private market investment in Gold.

""Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an 'alternative' currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term… Mechanically, the Bitcoin price would have to rise [to] $130,000 to match the total private sector investment in gold,” JP Morgan reportedly said in the email.



In what has been a landmark year for Bitcoin, the continued support from incumbents in the legacy financial sector is very bullish, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both filing to offer products in the space.



As time passes and the Bitcoin price continues to fly on the back of additional adoption and entrance into the space, expect additional upward price target revisions from JPMorgan and others, who have historically remained far too bearish. Matching the private sector investment in gold is just the start, as Wall Street will come to find out.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is paring a portion of its recent gains entering the new weekly session, trading just a little over $57,000 after breaching $60,000 last week.

Investors have shifted their focus on the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, coming out Wednesday in a relatively quiet macroeconomic week. The question remains how the US central bank would react to rising interest rates in the bond markets. A rate hike proposal could erase some gains off the Bitcoin market, which exploded against an ultra-loose policy environment.

Lower benchmark rates sap investors’ appetite for government bonds for returning dismissing yields. As a result, the United States attracts less foreign capital, which, in turn, hurts the US dollar demand. Additionally, the prospect of rising government debts also shifts investors to riskier alternatives, benefiting riskier assets like bitcoin.

So far, the cryptocurrency’s hardcore investors are relaxed, owing to the Fed’s “dot plot” of interest rate projections that signals no rate hikes until 2024. Nevertheless, compared to the end of the last year, more state-based central bankers have penciled in higher interest rates.

Bitcoin investors could choose to focus on Fed’s statements on growth and inflation, especially after the central bank’s commitment to let the inflation rate run higher above 2 percent.

Potential Actions Ahead

The amount of fiscal stimulus released by Joe Biden’s administration has further increased inflationary risks hugely. Therefore, it is likely that Fed intervenes sooner or later by raising its rates to avoid aggressive upside ticks in consumer prices. Or, it could simply decide to intervene by purchasing longer-dated government debts.

All and all, Bitcoin looks attractive long-term, so any potential selling this week might not become a full-fledged bearish assault.

A team of strategists at JPMorgan & Chase noted that the BTC/USD exchange rate could reach $130,000 for as long as it challenges the gold’s status-quo as the leading hedging asset against fiat.

“Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency implies [a] big upside for bitcoin over the long term… Mechanically, the Bitcoin price would have to rise [to] $130,000 to match the total private sector investment in gold,” JP Morgan reportedly said.

Bitcoin Technical Outlook

Data on ByBt.com shows that around 12,000 Bitcoin tokens left exchanges in the previous 30 days. Meanwhile, the cost to purchase one Bitcoin is up 20.35 percent. The correlation between the two metrics represents traders’ willingness to hold their crypto investments than trade them for other assets.

Technically, a bitcoin above $50,000 represents a bullish outlook, given uncertainties around the Fed’s ability to pursue its dot plot. Short-term, the cryptocurrency looks it could maintain weekly support above $55,000. Should it sustain above the price floor, its likelihood of retesting $60,000 for a breakout will be higher.

""I see over the next year or two, two kinds of coin,"" he told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Monday. ""Blood coin from China, (and) clean coin mined sustainably in countries that use hydroelectricity, not coal.""

Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, and around 65% of the world's bitcoin was mined in China as of April 2020, according to Statista.

""I'm going on the side of clean coin,"" said O'Leary.

O'Leary did not elaborate on where he acquires ""clean"" bitcoin, but some countries use hydroelectric power more widely than others, and there are entities that claim to mine cryptocurrencies in a sustainable way.

The chairman of O'Shares ETFs once called bitcoin ""garbage,"" but changed his mind more recently and said he would allocate 3% of his personal portfolio to the cryptocurrency, according to a CoinDesk report.

O'Leary said he was ""inundated"" by institutions asking if he was buying ""blood coin from China"" after he said he wanted to invest in bitcoin.","Why did this happen?

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has obtained authorization from a federal court to seek information on cryptocurrency users from Circle and Poloniex exchange platforms. The tax authority wants records identifying crypto users who conducted $20,000 or more in crypto transactions during the years 2016 to 2020 as well as other documents relating to their crypto transactions.

IRS Got Court Approval to Summon Data on Crypto Users From Circle and Poloniex

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Thursday that a federal court has authorized the IRS “to serve a John Doe summons” on “Circle Internet Financial Inc., or its predecessors, subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, including Poloniex.” The notice reads:

The IRS is seeking the records of Americans who engaged in business with or through Circle, a digital currency exchanger headquartered in Boston.

Poloniex is named in the order since Circle bought the crypto exchange platform in 2018 but spun out the following year into a new company, Polo Digital Assets Ltd.

The DOJ further explained that the IRS is “seeking information about U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least the equivalent of $20,000 in transactions in cryptocurrency during the years 2016 to 2020.” The Justice Department elaborated that “the IRS is requesting that Circle produce records identifying the U.S. taxpayers described above, along with other documents relating to their cryptocurrency transactions.”

The court order explains that the “John Doe” summons seeks information related to the IRS’s “investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons” that the IRS has reasonable basis to believe “may have failed to comply with any provision of any internal revenue laws.”

The IRS previously served crypto exchange operator Coinbase a similar John Doe summons. The company fought the order for more than a year before complying with a court order and handed over data of about 14,000 customers. According to Coinbase, this represented a 97% reduction in the number of customers impacted by this summons.

By mid-afternoon, the crypto market cap was at $2.02 trillion.

The surge was led by bitcoin, which hit its own milestone by holding at a $1 trillion market cap for one week. Bitcoin was last up 1.4% at $59,045. Since hitting a lifetime peak of more than $61,000 in mid-March, bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow range.

Analysts said as long as bitcoin stays above $53,000, it will be able to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.

Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, was up 1.3% at $2,103. Its market cap was $244 billion on Monday. It hit a record high of $2,144.99 last Friday.

“Momentum and interest have begun to expand beyond bitcoin and ethereum,” said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at crypto exchange Bitfinex.

“As the industry continues to mature, we expect more blockchain-based applications to be introduced to the world, and coinciding with that, a surge of interest around other alternative assets... as they become more market-ready,” he added.

Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in a research report, said the fact that bitcoin has held the $1 trillion market cap for one week is a “strong vote of confidence for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class as a whole.”

It added that on-chain activity continues to reinforce bitcoin’s robust position, with a volume equivalent to over 10% of circulating supply transacting above the $1 trillion threshold.

Also on Monday, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a $35 billion publicly listed investment vehicle that holds bitcoin, said it remains committed to converting to an exchange traded fund. In a blog post, Grayscale said the timing of its transition would depend on the regulatory environment.

Bitcoin has risen more than 100% this year, while ethereum has gained nearly 190%. Both have massively outperformed traditional asset classes, bolstered by the entry of mainstream companies and large investors into the cryptocurrency world, including Tesla Inc and BNY Mellon.","Why did this happen?

Kimchi Premium is the spread between bitcoin's price on South Korean crypto exchanges and Western exchanges.

Bitcoin is currently trading at around $66,200 on Bithumb, according to TradingView. That is whopping about 15% or $9,000 higher than bitcoin's price of around $57,000 on Coinbase.

Ether (ETH) is also trading higher at around $2,350 on Bithumb compared to $2,020 on Coinbase, according to TradingView.

The Kimchi Premium suggests rising demand for bitcoin and ether in South Korea as the cryptocurrency market continues to soar worldwide.

While there is Kimchi Premium, that doesn't mean one can buy bitcoin or ether at a lower price globally and sell it at a higher price in South Korea. That is because Korean crypto exchanges don't accept foreign clients due to local regulations.

Korean citizens also cannot buy cryptocurrencies at lower prices on global exchanges because these exchanges don't support Korean won. Binance and OKEx had local exchanges in Korea, but both shut them down recently.

The Kimchi Premium first appeared in 2016, according to the University of Calgary. Between 2016 and 2018, the Kimchi Premium averaged nearly 4.80% and was as high as almost 55% in January 2018, per the report.","Bitcoin price could take a breather before continuing its uptrend.

Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s footsteps as buying pressure vanes, but its bullish target is still intact.

Ripple shows a massive breakout from the head-and-shoulders pattern, hinting at a climb toward $1.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum paused their trajectory as this technical indicator flashed a cycle top signal. The retracement that ensued left a lot of the over-leveraged traders liquidated. Regardless, both cryptocurrencies still have their upside target in place.

Separating itself from the consensus, Ripple saw a massive surge in bullish momentum that pushed its price 17% higher, resulting in a breakout of a bullish pattern, indicating more gains on its way.

Bitcoin price eyes minor pullback before resuming uptrend

The Bitcoin price rally seems to be contained inside an ascending parallel channel since January 8 as it created two higher highs and three lower lows.

At the time of writing, BTC seems to be limping lower due to the Momentum Reversal Indicator’s (MRI) cycle top signal presented in the form of a red one candlestick on the daily chart.

This setup forecasts a one-to-four candlestick correction. Hence, if the downtrend were to continue, the Bitcoin price would most likely head toward the support at $54,978, which coincides with the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

A bounce from this barrier could propel the flagship cryptocurrency by 37% toward the upper trend line around $75,300, with a pitstop at the MRI’sbreakout line at $67,600.

BTC/USD 1-day chart

However, if the demand barrier at $54,978 breaks down, it would signal the start of a downtrend. In which case, BTC price could drop 14% to $47,220, which intersects with the 100 SMA.

Ethereum price slows down before next leg up

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum created multiple lower highs and higher lows from February 20 to March 29. Such a price action forms a symmetrical triangle pattern when the swing points are connected using trend lines.

As of March 30, ETH price shattered this setup’s upper boundary, confirming a 36% upswing to $2,530. This target is determined by measuring the distance between the swing high and swing low at the broadest part of the technical formation.

Since the MRI indicator flashed a cycle top signal for the Etheruem price on April 2, this upswing faced a temporary stop. Now, ETH awaits accumulation before continuing its rally to $2,530.

ETH/USD 1-day chart

A spike in selling pressure that pushes the Ethereum price to slice through the 50 SMA at $1,760 will signal a potential reversal in play. The turnaround will be confirmed when the bears break below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,620.

If this were to happen, the smart contracts platform token would collapse 6% to the 100 SMA at $1,520. Following this, a 15% crash to the immediate demand barrier at $1,300 seems likely.

Ripple price eyes $1 as buyers come out of the woodwork

While BTC and ETH saw their momentum diminish, the Ripple price revealed a massive pump that led to a breakout of the head-and-shoulders pattern.

XRP price created three bottoms with the extreme ones, known as “shoulders,” which are of comparable depths. However, the middle one is referred to as “head” and is lower than the rest. The peaks of all these dips faced rejection around a common supply barrier at $0.63, known as “neckline.”

This setup forecasts a 73% upswing, determined by adding the distance between the head’s bottom to the neckline. Adding this measure to $0.63 reveals a target of $1.09.

As of Monday, a spike in buying pressure has caused a breakout of the neckline, signaling the 73% bull rally’s start.

XRP/USDT 1-day chart

If the buyers fail to keep the XRP price above $0.63, then the upswing might be in danger. The bullish outlook will face extinction if the sellers push Ripple below 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.42.","Ethereum price rallying on news that Visa will use its network to settle transactions.

March 31 breakout preceded by a symmetrical triangle.

Weighted social sentiment flips to slightly bullish from extremely bearish.

Etheruem price printed an all-time on April 2 on above-average for the first time since February 3. ETH has been strongly rising since last week on the news that Visa would be using the Ethereum network to settle cryptocurrency transactions. Adding to the bullish anthem were Mark Cuban’s comments about owning the token and that it’s closest “to a true currency.”

Ethereum price reclaims the psychologically important $2,000

As the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH does capture traders’ attention. Still, the tendency to track the price movements of Bitcoin has always had it playing second fiddle to the pioneer cryptocurrency.

The ETH breakout has captured social media attention, lifting the Weight Social Sentiment from overwhelmingly bearish to marginally bullish over the last few days. In contrast, it is occurring as Bitcoin’s social media mood further declines, indicating a lack of confidence in the top coin’s short-term price potential.

Source: Sanbase

An FXStreet article on March 31 highlighted the symmetrical triangle pattern and commented that the consolidation was nearing completion. The resulting upswing generated a 14% gain over three days and secured an all-time high.

Moving forward, ETH is quietly consolidating the breakout along the previous all-time high from February at $ $2,041.42. All-time highs can be a challenge, and the back-and-forth price action may continue in the short-term, but if the altcoin remains above the symmetrical triangle, the bullish outlook remains in play.

Upside targets begin with 1.382 Fibonacci extension level at $2,327.41 followed by the 1.618 extension level at $2,504.09. The measured move of the symmetrical triangle is slightly above at $2,559.25.

In percent terms, a rally to $2,559.25 would be a 37% gain from the breakout at $1,872.51 and a 22% gain from the current price.

ETH/USD daily chart

If ETH fails, the first significant support is the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $1,759.63, followed by the rising trendline of the symmetrical triangle at $1.679. Additional support surfaces at the 100-day SMA at $1,525.77.

Ebonex was operating in beta since mid-March in an invite-only mode before the complete launch. The exchange is listing numerous top digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, Polkadot and Litecoin.

However, the company did not clarify the jurisdictional presence of the cryptocurrency exchange.

“The launch of our cryptocurrency exchange business will not only expand the revenue sources from our cryptocurrency business but also optimize the development of our blockchain industry chain,” Hu added.

Ebang is one of the top Bitcoin miners manufacturers, lagging only behind its other Chinese competitors. The company went public last year on a United States stock exchange and is one of the few publicly traded crypto companies. However, investors did not take the new crypto exchange launch positively as the shares of the company went down by almost 5 percent as of press time, since the opening of the Monday market."

The crypto market's value has pushed past $2 trillion for the first time after doubling in two months.

Bitcoin, which makes up about 50% of the entire crypto market, has rallied 100% so far this year.

Morgan Stanley, PayPal, Mastercard, and other firms have taken the plunge to embrace digital assets.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has exceeded $2 trillion for the first time, after doubling in two months, spurred by rising institutional demand for bitcoin and ethereum.

Bitcoin's market value makes up more than 50% of that figure and it is now worth more than $1 trillion, data from Coinmarketcap.com showed.

It was last trading at $58,523 on Tuesday, only about 4% lower from last month's all-time high of almost $61,000.

Bitcoin has already rallied 100% so far this year, and is up 700% in the last 12 months.

The next five biggest coins - Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, Tether, and Polkadot - together are valued at about $422 billion. More than 6,600 cryptocurrencies exist in total.

The latest jump in the cryptocurrency market cap has partly been driven by growing interest in ethereum.

The price of ether rose to an all-time high of $2,077 on Friday following growing enthusiasm over its use in decentralized finance or DeFi applications.

""Users are already relying on decentralized applications as opposed to banks and fintechs in order to borrow and lend their money, earning high yield, minting new assets, and trading on exchanges run by protocols instead of companies like Robinhood,"" Sergey Nazarov, cofounder of blockchain platform Chainlink, told Insider by email.

""The significance of this initial shift from centralized finance to decentralized finance cannot be overstated.""

Big Wall Street players increasingly seem to want in on bitcoin.

A recent decline in its volatility has made it more appealing to institutions seeking to diversify portfolios, JPMorgan said last week.

Morgan Stanley has approved bitcoin exposure for a handful of funds accessible to its wealthiest clients, while companies like Mastercard, PayPal, and Starbucks are all taking steps to enable crypto payments.

Goldman Sachs could begin to offer investment vehicles with bitcoin exposure as soon as the second quarter, CNBC reported.

""As the industry continues to mature, we expect more blockchain-based applications to be introduced to the world, and coinciding with that, a surge of interest around other alternative assets, decentralized apps and ecosystems as they become more market-ready,"" Paolo Ardoino, CTO at crypto exchange Bitfinex, told Insider.","Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most widely recognized and largest cryptocurrency markets in the world. Bitcoin was introduced to the market in 2009, initially trading at less than the value of a cent, it has since risen in value to over $50,000, Ethereum, more recently debuted in 2015, has in the space of 6 years increased from $3 a token to selling well over $2000. The near fantastical growth of these two digital assets has drawn investors looking to cash in on the trend.

New investors, however, may be led to believe that Bitcoin and Ethereum are the same. This belief would be encouraged because both services offer cryptocurrency coins. Bitcoin offers the titular Bitcoin, while Ethereum offers Ether; however, nothing could be further from the truth.

Bitcoin, the forerunner of all cryptocurrencies, was designed as a digital currency that would eventually replace fiat currency. It has inbuilt features intended to maintain a stable store of value in the cryptocurrency. As well as being a decentralized currency free from government or commission control, there is a limited supply of Bitcoin in the market, ensuring that its value never becomes inflationary. And because these features make bitcoin very similar to gold, bitcoin has become a favorite of investors looking for long-term investments.

Ethereum, on the other hand, was built around different principles and use cases. Ethereum is a decentralized network designed for the end-level user. One of its most popular features being the creation of decentralized applications by users of the Ethereum network, through which smart contracts can be arranged. These features have unveiled a new world of finance called decentralized finance or DeFi, which aims to put total control of digital currencies in the users’ hands.

Alex Adelman, CEO of Lolli, has compared Bitcoin and Ethereum to Gold and Electricity, respectively, because Bitcoin, like gold, stores value for future use Ethereum, like electricity, facilitates other innovative technologies.

So the curious investor looking for a long-term investment that is stable and assured should buy into the bitcoin market. But for any investors looking for a market with a high potential for rewards, albeit with significant risk, Ethereum, and its smart contracts, may be the right fit.","Coinbase, the eight-year-old, privately held, San Francisco-based startup that is a trading platform for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, Tuesday evening announced its financial results for 2021, and said it foresees a wide range of scenarios for the market this year, including a sharp drop in price.

Bitcoin's price has soared the past six months from $10,600 to over $57,000 U.S. dollars per Bitcoin, as companies such as Tesla, PayPal, and Square have emphasized buying reserves of the currency and making it possible for customers to transact in the currency.

Coinbase, which makes money off the volume of people transacting on its platform to buy and sell currencies, had 6.1 million transacting users, or MTUs, in the three months ended in March, it said.

To forecast this year, ""Given the inherent unpredictability of our business […] we are providing a range of possible scenarios for full-year 2021,"" the company said.

The ""high"" scenario sees the overall market capitalization of crypto continuing to increase, pushing up Coinbase's MTUs to 7 million.

A ""mid"" scenario ""assumes flat crypto market capitalization,"" the company said, and ""low to moderate volatility"" in crypto prices. That would possibly reduce MTUs to 5.5 million, it said.

The ""low"" scenario would see a ""significant decrease in crypto market capitalization, similar to the decrease observed in 2018,"" the company said, ""And low levels of crypto asset price volatility thereafter.

Bitcoin's price in 2018 plunged from a high of over $19,000 per Bitcoin to under $4,000.

""In this scenario, we assume MTUs will decrease in a corresponding manner and end 2021 at similar levels to Q4 2020.""

As for its own results, the surge in crypto prices has been a boon to the company's volume of business. Coinbase had $335 billion worth of trading volume on its platform in the March quarter, producing $1.8 billion in revenue. The company expects $700 million to $800 million of net income from that activity.

Coinbase has received $539 million in venture capital financing since 2015 from firms that include AH Capital Management LLC, Manhattan Venture Partners, Y Combinator, and Initialized Capital Management.","In preparation for its debut on the Nasdaq next week, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said on Tuesday that first-quarter revenue climbed about nine-fold from last year, driven by a historic rally in the price of bitcoin. Revenue in the period jumped to about $1.8 billion from $190.6 million in the same quarter a year earlier, Coinbase said in a press release, adding that the results are preliminary and unaudited. Net income grew to between $730 million and $800 million from $31.9 million a year ago. Coinbase said it has 56 million verified users.

Coinbase is poised to become the latest tech company to hit the market with a massive valuation, capitalizing on continued growth in the sector despite broader economic struggles caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Trading on the private market has valued the company at $68 billion, a number that swells to about $100 billion when factoring in a fully-diluted share count.

In the past seven months, software vendor Snowflake, food delivery app DoorDash, room-sharing site Airbnb and gaming platform Roblox have all gone public. Their market caps are currently between $40 billion and $113 billion. Coinbase is unique because its valuation increase mirrors the trajectory of the top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is up about 700% in the past year, while ethereum has soared by more than 1,100%.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Bitcoin and ethereum in the past year CNBC","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase saw a whopping 117% quarter-over-quarter increase in monthly transacting users, the firm revealed Tuesday in its voluntary earnings report.

All those users helped Coinbase rake in $1.8 billion over the quarter, driving a net income of approximately $730 million to $800 million, according to a new filing that comes ahead of the company’s Nasdaq listing next week.

All the numbers point to a business riding high as interest in cryptocurrency tracks upward with the price of bitcoin, ether and other leading assets.

For example:

Active users on Coinbase jumped from 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.

Verified users – or the total number of people with Coinbase accounts – increased from 43 million at the end of 2020 to 56 million at the end of Q1 2021.

Trading volumes topped $335 billion in Q1. For all of 2020, trading volume was $193 billion.

Total assets on Coinbase's platform increased from $90 billion to $223 billion, nearly a 150% increase quarter-over-quarter.

Showing how solidly Coinbase has cemented itself at the center of the current bull run, some $122 billion of those assets were from institutions.

On the retail side, the company will be adding more assets and giving people more access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during Tuesday’s earnings call.

On the institutional side, the company will continue to build out its prime brokerage offering and use its Bison Trails acquisition to create what Armstrong called the “Amazon Web Services for crypto.”

The exchange also gave three financial scenarios for the rest of 2021.

In a “high” performance scenario, Coinbase would average 7 million monthly users if the crypto market capitalization grows throughout the rest of the year. In a “mid” scenario, the exchange would average 5.5 million monthly users if the market capitalization is flat. In a “low” scenario, the exchange would average 4 million if the market turns into something like the 2018 bear market.

“For the last two years we’ve seen average net revenue per [monthly transacting user] range between $34 and $45 per month,” Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas said on the call. Haas said she expects the average net revenue per user to reach new records in 2021.

Coinbase’s new cohort of stock analysts were particularly keen on user metrics, as CoinDesk reported earlier today.

“The first quarter more than doubled monthly users sequentially and revenue followed three times higher than the previous quarter,” James Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna International Group, told CoinDesk after Coinbase’s earnings call, adding:","Grayscale investments revealed that it was fully committed to launching a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as it finds more ways for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market

Grayscale Investments said that it was 100% committed to launching a Bitcoin ETF. The digital asset management firm said this in a blog post yesterday, adding that it intended to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF.

“First and foremost, we wish to make clear: we are 100% committed to converting GBTC into an ETF”, the firm said. Grayscale went on to narrate its journey towards becoming perhaps the leading cryptocurrency asset management firm.

According to Grayscale, it was the first company to launch a publicly traded Bitcoin fund in the United States. It was also the first and only firm to convert a Bitcoin fund into an SEC-reporting company. Currently, Grayscale’s GBTC and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) are the two crypto funds in the world that are SEC-reporting companies.

The company intends to convert its products into exchange-traded funds. Grayscale stated that “Each Grayscale product is at various stages of this lifecycle, and our intention has always been to convert these products into an ETF when permissible”.

While most people believe this is the first time Grayscale is discussing the possibilities of a Bitcoin ETF, the firm said that it had been monitoring the situation closely from a commercial and regulatory perspective for several years.

The digital asset management firm said it had previously submitted a Bitcoin ETF application. “Grayscale first submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF in 2016 and spent the better part of 2017 in conversations with the SEC”, the post added.

However, Grayscale withdrew its application as it believed the cryptocurrency regulatory environment wasn’t matured enough at the time. The firm has been communicating with the Securities and Exchange Commission and now intends to convert its GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF.

When GBTC becomes a Bitcoin ETF, shareholders of publicly traded GBTC shares will not be required to do anything, and the management fee will be reduced accordingly as per the company. The Bitcoin ETF battle is heating up in the United States.

The SEC had previously rejected numerous Bitcoin ETF applications. However, there is renewed optimism within the crypto space that the new regime will approve an ETF. So far, the SEC has received six Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from WisdomTree, VanEck and Fidelity.","A popular bitcoin market indicator known as the “kimchi premium” is signaling a retail frenzy in South Korea historically observed when prices are peaking.

But this time might be different, analysts say – possibly the result of the dramatic growth and maturation witnessed in cryptocurrency markets over the past few years.

The kimchi premium represents the difference between bitcoin’s price on South Korean exchanges and the going rate on other global trading venues. The reasons for the discrepancy are complicated, but they ultimately stem from trading limitations unique to the country’s exchanges and the existence of domestic capital controls.

Historically, spikes in the Korean premium have taken the wind out of the bull runs, according to data tweeted by Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde. The metric peaked at 47% in January 2018 and 63% in May 2017, just prior to market corrections, but it’s also marked tops at minor price peaks at 6.5% in November 2018 and 8.5% in June 2019.

Lately, the premium has risen to 18%, the highest since February 2018, according to data source CryptoQuant.

And although bitcoin prices have doubled this year, the Korean spread shows no signs of peaking yet and it’s impossible to say whether the premium is about to reach a top, or if will continue increasing. Besides, South Korea is no longer the crypto heavyweight it was during the last major market cycle in 2017-18.

“The Korean market contributed to 7.9% of the worldwide crypto trading volume in 2017,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of the South Korea-based CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “Now it accounts for less than 2%.”

“Hence, an eventual collapse of the premium is unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader market,” Ju said.

Bitcoin fell over 49% in one month after the kimchi premium peaked on Jan. 8, 2018, and remained in a bear market till the end of the year. The cryptocurrency suffered notable price drops following peak premiums observed in mid-November 2018 and at the end of January 2019.

And while the previous crypto fever in South Korea was primarily fueled by investors belonging to the age group of 20 to 30, the latest frenzy has seen equal participation from Koreans in their 40s and 50s, as discussed last month by The Diplomat, a magazine covering politics, society and culture in the Indo-Pacific region.

“Through cryptocurrency and stock market transactions, South Koreans – young and old – are actively seeking to secure steady streams of passive income,” The Diplomat said. “Increasingly after COVID-19, both of these age groups seem to be alarmed by fears of monetary inflation followed by the government’s stimulus packages, skyrocketing real estate prices, and stagnating wages in the extremely competitive job market.”

So the latest uptick in interest in cryptocurrencies in South Korea might be more sustainable, not just speculative fervor.

Still, a minor pullback cannot be ruled out.

At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $58,000, down 2% on the day. Prices have been restricted to a narrow range of $55,000 to $60,000 since the end of March.

What is Kimchi premium?

Executing a classic arbitrage strategy by buying bitcoin on western exchanges and selling the same on Korean exchanges at a relatively higher price is quite challenging.

That’s because the Korean market is served by local exchanges that provide Korean won (KRW) fiat trading pairs, and local users do not trade cryptocurrencies using tether (USDT) or BTC most of the time, as per Binance Research.

Therefore, a Korean wanting to “arb” the premium has to first buy a token with KRW that could be exchanged for USDT or other stablecoin, which then would be used to purchase bitcoin on a non-U.S. exchange. The tedious process doesn’t stop here. The bitcoin will have to be transferred back to Korean exchanges for liquidation.

“The relatively long transaction confirmation time, without hedging, leaves the arbitrageur exposed to price fluctuations during the transfer,” Binance research said in a Telegram message.","Bitcoin price successfully defended a key support level on the daily chart and aims for new all-time highs.

Ethereum price has established a new all-time high at $2,150 in the past 24 hours.

Ripple price has experienced a massive 60% explosion in the past two days.

The cryptocurrency market recovered from the dip on March 25 and has hit a new all-time high in market capitalization at $1.99 trillion. Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin lately, but the biggest winner has been XRP. Surprisingly, the digital asset had a massive 60% rally after Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said he is hopeful thanks to the new SEC administration.

Bitcoin price resumes daily uptrend, aiming for new all-time high

Bitcoin had a significant correction from the previous all-time high of $61,844 formed on March 13. The flagship cryptocurrency lost 18.5% of its value in the next two weeks, creating a local bottom of 50,427 on March 25.

BTC/USD daily chart

However, the digital asset managed to bounce back up, recovering the 12 and 26 EMA support levels. In the past four days, Bitcoin bulls have defended the 12 EMA and are ready for a new leg up above the key resistance level of $60,218 toward the previous all-time high.

BTC IOMAP chart

The In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model shows a ton of support between $58,518 and $55,019, where 3.1 million addresses purchased over 1.2 million BTC. This range will absorb a lot of short-term selling pressure.

Additionally, there is far weaker resistance above $58,500, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand, and it will be easier to push the Bitcoin price toward $60,218 and ultimately to a new all-time high.

However, losing this great support area would quickly drive the Bitcoin price toward $50,000 as there are no other significant support points below.

Ethereum price hits new all-time high as 14 million ETH are locked away

One of the biggest strengths of Ethereum is the fact that a large majority of coins are locked away from exchanges. The ETH2 deposit contract holds more than 3.7 million ETH worth around $7.8 billion at the time of writing.

The number of ETH locked in DeFi hit 10.7 million, which means that 14.4 million ETH are locked away and cannot be sold currently. This number represents $30 billion worth of ETH, which is around 13% of the total circulating supply.

ETH/USD daily chart

Ethereum remains contained in an ascending broadening wedge pattern on the daily chart. The upper boundary of this pattern is currently located at around $3,200, and ETH has practically no resistance ahead.

ETH Supply on Exchanges

Additionally, the number of ETH inside exchanges also dropped in the past two weeks despite the smart contracts giant hitting new all-time highs. Since March 19, this number dropped by 0.9%.

ETH/USD daily chart

However, on the daily chart, the RSI is close to overextension again, which has proven to be an accurate indicator of upcoming corrections. The digital asset could fall toward the 12 EMA at $1,970 if selling pressure continues mounting.

Ripple price explodes by 80% in 48 hours

It seems that fears about the SEC lawsuit have dissipated as XRP holders have pushed its price to new yearly highs for no apparent reason. Brad Garlinghouse has stated:

I find a certain irony that the SEC would bring a lawsuit against us, because what they’re saying is not just that we should have known and we’ve acted in bad faith when the SEC themselves haven’t really said they know for sure that XRP is a security. In their own court filings, they said that the court will determine that, which of course brings a contradiction that if the court’s going to determine that, how could I personally have known that the SEC would view XRP as a security.

However, the CEO also stated that Ripple can easily continue without XRP, which should not be positive news for XRP holders.

XRP/USD daily chart

This is the highest price point in two years for XRP. Using the Fibonacci retracement tool, we can determine several support levels on the way down. The nearest is established at $0.90, which is the 78.6% Fib level, followed by $0.74 at the 61.8% level.",
2021-04-07,"Pete Rizzo, one of the journalists who's been writing about cryptocurrency the longest, answers key questions about the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Pete Rizzo is uniquely positioned to answer questions about the future of cryptocurrencies, having covered them extensively as a journalist since 2013.

Best known for serving as the editor-in-chief-of leading crypto news site Coindesk from 2014 to 2019, Rizzo is currently an Editor at Bitcoin Magazine and Editor-at-Large at the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. He is also an advisor to Crypto Investor, a new subscription publication being launched today on TheStreet.

Here he answers questions about what to expect from cryptocurrencies in the coming years, including the significance of Morgan Stanley (MS) - Get Report and Goldman Sachs GS allowing their clients to invest in bitcoin, and whether or not any other cryptocurrencies could eventually supplant bitcoin’s leading position.

What’s the bullish case for bitcoin and crypto in general?

Bitcoin is, first and foremost, an innovation. For the first time in history, it has allowed humanity to manage a money supply without the need for a third-party like a bank or government to maintain or operate it. That has dramatic implications for the global markets, which are dominated today by assets and monies managed by these types of entities.

5 Stocks to Buy for Bitcoin Exposure

Remember, over the last 12 years, bitcoin has grown from being worth nothing to a high of $60,000, but that is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of its potential growth. A moderate longer-term bull outlook for bitcoin would find it taking a place as a dominant money on the global stage.

I believe it helps to view the larger crypto asset market as an attempt to further this innovation in new and interesting (though not always well-intentioned) ways.

What’s the bearish case for bitcoin and crypto?

I’ll start with the caveat that while I find the bear case for bitcoin unlikely, it remains possible it remains a niche asset or that it fails. However, this overlooks both its track record as a monetary asset, as well as the fact that it has arguably created its own cyclical economy.

The bearish case for cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is that the extra features these systems claim will add value, don’t actually work in the ways they intend. For example, Ethereum claims to extend bitcoin’s core innovation, asserting applications will need or want to operate without third parties, while XRP claims banks will need or want to use this type of distributed software system to exchange value.

Jim Cramer: GameStop Could Be Saved by Crypto

This is a bit of an oversimplification, since the underlying claims behind a lot of cryptocurrencies can be hard to pick apart. Still, I think it’s important to look at most cryptocurrencies as claims to future innovations that may or may not be proven useful or desirable.

How significant do you think it is that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will soon be allowing their clients to invest in bitcoin?

Obviously this is a huge validation for Bitcoin as an asset and technology. I’m not sure many institutions have a strong conviction in Bitcoin yet, but the latest moves are proof that it’s now too big to ignore.

That’s one of the reasons we’re excited about launching TheStreet’s new subscription publication, Crypto Investor. We’re eager to hear how Wall Street is trading this emerging asset class and to share these findings with the many retail investors now becoming interested in the market.

Ultimately, however, investors should keep in mind that bitcoin is seeking to build a new monetary system, one where cryptographic guarantees might even one day replace the roles of traditional banks.

Remember, the innovation with bitcoin is that individuals can take possession of a digital money for the first time. So, while you could choose to hold your bitcoin at a bank or institution, you are still able to take possession of your private keys and can store them safely on a simple hardware wallet or another type of low-cost consumer hardware.

Are NFTs a passing fad, or do you think they’re here to stay?

I understand the excitement around the NFT market. Given how hard it is to monetize creative work on the internet (and in general), it makes sense that creators would want to seize on the potential of cryptocurrency in this area.

However, I have deeper questions about NFT platforms and how they function. The 2017 crypto market boom was propelled by a similar period where many claimed that the data managed by blockchains could represent other types of value -- from social network effects to startup equity.

The legacy of these claims has not been great. Here again, the claim is that an NFT -- a unique string of cryptographic numbers on a blockchain -- can represent another item, in this case a digital file. Ultimately, however, this digital file may not be stored on the blockchain itself, but may just link to a file managed on a third-party server or platform.

Jim Cramer's NFT Bid Is a Lesson for Investors

At the end of the day, a bitcoin only promises to represent a bitcoin, and your ownership of it is ensured by the collective auditing of the blockchain by a global network of computers. NFTs don’t appear to offer the same guarantees.

Do you think bitcoin will continue to be the dominant cryptocurrency, or will others eventually challenge its position?

You can definitely spend years researching and coming to various conclusions about this question. The answer for me is that I do think bitcoin will remain the dominant cryptocurrency because its developers have thought longer and harder about the system they are building and what sets it apart from traditional money systems.

I’d encourage readers to follow their own path on this question. If you’re looking to read up on bitcoin and its potential, The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous is a great start.","Mark J. Rebilas/Getty Images

Mark Cuban said the Ethereum upgrades will make it more eco-friendly and usable.

The billionaire investors said he was excited about smart contracts and NFTs on Ethereum.

""Let's just say I own a lot more Ethereums than I do bitcoins,"" he told the Unchained podcast.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has praised the controversial upgrades to the Ethereum network, saying they should make it more eco-friendly and help the system's applications ""dwarf"" bitcoin.

Speaking on the Unchained podcast, Dallas Mavericks owner Cuban said the move to a more efficient system will mean ""the holdback of the impact on the environment will change immediately.""

""That is going to give some people a reason to use Ethereum as a store of value over bitcoin, right there."" He predicted that Ethereum and 2 or 3 other blockchains will prove to be the ""winners"" in a few years' time.

Ethereum developers are planning to make major changes to the network that will limit transaction fees and start to burn coins, which has angered many miners. The developers intend to eventually move the system to a whole new way of verifying transactions, known as proof of stake.

""With proof of stake, you're going to be able to have... a significantly higher multiple in transactions per second, that's going to improve the utilization and the opportunities to create on Ethereum,"" Cuban told Unchained's Laura Shin.

The ""Shark Tank"" star said he was bullish about the Ethereum blockchain because of its numerous uses, including non-fungible tokens and smart contracts, code that can create secure financial agreements without the need for third parties.

""I think the applications leveraging smart contracts and extensions on Ethereum will dwarf bitcoin,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Bitcoin. I'm not. But at the same time, let's just say I own a lot more Ethereums than I do bitcoins.""

The Ethereum blockchain's native cryptocurrency ether has soared in recent months to more than $2,000, and is up over 1,000% over the last year.

The network has been central to the boom in non-fungible tokens or NFTs, collectible digital assets that cannot be exchanged with one another for equal value, or broken down into smaller bits.

Ethereum developers are planning to make major changes to the network to make it more efficient and predictable. The upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 will see the network more to a ""proof of stake"" system, which analysts say is quicker and more environmentally friendly, but which is likely to be painful for miners.

Cuban said the changes would add to the appeal of Ethereum relative to the bitcoin blockchain.

""Bitcoin, right now, has evolved to be primarily a store value, and it's very difficult to use it for anything else,"" he said. ""You really have to work a lot harder on bitcoin than you do on ethereum.""

He added: ""In a few years, I think Ethereum and maybe 2 or 3 other blockchains will have their place, and those will be the winners.""","Bitcoin whales are moving their crypto assets in large amounts as a user moved nearly $300 million worth of BTC yesterday.

The latest data from Glassnode indicates that over 1.98 million Bitcoin have been transacted above the $1 trillion market cap. Bitcoin whales play an important role in BTC’s price action as the movement of large amounts creates a supply shortage. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, recently saw massive BTC outflows.

In addition to the latest movement of 5,193 BTC, a crypto whale moved 3,357 BTC worth more than $196 million on 6 April. The transaction was executed at 19:07 UTC.

Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin

Bitcoin’s institutional adoption is surging since the start of 2021. The world’s largest cryptocurrency saw its best Q1 performance in 2021 for the first time since 2013. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, Tesla, Square and Meitu have accumulated digital currency in large amounts over the last few months. MicroStrategy announced earlier this week that the company has purchased an additional $15 million worth of Bitcoin. The business intelligence firm now has more than 91,000 BTC.

Commenting on the institutional adoption of Bitcoin during an interview with CNBC, David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said: “There are significant regulatory restrictions around us and us acting as a principle around cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As our clients have demand to be involved in this space, we can continue to find ways to support our clients.”","Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of the largest global cryptocurrency exchange Binance and one of the world’s top crypto billionaires, does not own much except crypto.

“I’m one of those guys who value liquidity much more than owning something. I actually prefer not to own anything,” Zhao said in a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday.

He noted that various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) now make up nearly 100% of his entire net worth as he does not own any real estate or much fiat holdings. When asked how much of his net worth is invested in crypto, Zhao said:

“I would say probably close to 100%. I don’t own any fiat. The physical stuff that I own is probably negligible in terms of my net worth. So, this is a concept shift. I’m not using crypto to buy fiat; I’m not using crypto to buy houses. I just want to keep crypto. And I don’t plan to convert my crypto into cash in the future.”

Zhao said that it took him a while to ramp up his crypto portfolio. After buying his first Bitcoin, the CEO was in a big hurry to sell his apartment that he bought back in 2006 in Shanghai. “I sold my apartment to buy Bitcoin, and I also quit my job,” he said. ”You can rent an apartment or stay in a hotel — that gives you much higher liquidity,” Zhao added.

The Binance CEO has previously claimed that he does not hold any fiat currencies. “I hold 0 fiat,” Zhao declared on Twitter in February, stating that he only converts crypto to fiat for payments that can only be made with traditional money.

According to data from China’s Hurun Research Institute, Zhao is one of the world’s richest men in the crypto and blockchain industry, ranked the third-richest crypto billionaire with a total wealth estimated at $8 billion as of January 2021.","Ripple won the right on Tuesday to peek into the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) internal communications on how it determines whether a cryptocurrency is a security.

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm is hoping to find evidence the regulator defined XRP at some point as being similar to bitcoin and ether, two cryptocurrencies largely accepted as non-security instruments, according to a report by Law360.

The distinction is important as the SEC is alleging Ripple and two of its executives violated U.S. securities laws in selling XRP to retail consumers. The case may lead to a court ruling on how and when a cryptocurrency is considered a security that other startups in the U.S. could use as informal guidance in the future.

The eight years taken by the regulator to file suit against Ripple is also another angle being pushed by the cryptocurrency firm as it attempts to strengthen its argument in the five-month-old case.

Granted by U.S. Judge Sarah Netburn in the Southern District Court of New York, the motion affords Ripple access to the SEC’s minutes and memos “expressing the agency’s interpretation or views” on cryptocurrency, which Netburn said are likely discoverable. Netburn also said Ripple’s discovery was a “high-stakes” win, according to the report.

One of Ripple’s lawyers, Mathew Solomon, argued it could be “game over” for the entire case should Ripple catch the SEC as having privately stated XRP is more like a currency than a security because that would place XRP outside the regulator’s jurisdiction.

“I’m going to grant in large part the defendants’ motion,” said Netburn. As part of the ruling, staff-to-staff email communications will not have to be produced.

In December, the SEC sued Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen alleging they violated federal securities laws in selling $1.38 billion worth of XRP to the general public. The defendants are arguing they haven’t done anything wrong.

Related Stories","Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon has predicted a massive shift in how US authorities regulate cryptocurrencies.

David Solomon, chief executive of the investment banking company Goldman Sachs, is convinced that the regulatory landscape in the US will soon see a big change. The American investment banker projected that crypto regulations will see a shift regarding financial institutions.

Solomon describes the change as a “big evolution” that will affect how regulatory bodies in the US regulate Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Speaking on the Squawk Box program on CNBC yesterday, the Goldman Sachs boss appeared to hint that the crypto regulatory environment would change to accommodate banking institutions.

Asked about the multinational bank’s plans in relation to adopting Bitcoin, Solomon explained that Goldman Sachs is closely monitoring digital currencies.

“We continue to think about digital currency and the digitization of money in a very proactive way, and in that context, we are engaged with our clients, and we look at all this through the centricity of ‘what do our clients need?”

Financial institutions in the US are, at present, barred from providing direct crypto exposure to clients as crypto-assets like Bitcoin are categorised in the high-risk asset class. For this reason, institutions are only allowed to offer exposure to digital assets indirectly e.g. as exchange-traded funds or securities.

Solomon predicted that this restriction would soon be lifted in some way since the cryptocurrency sector is advancing. However, he failed to speculate exactly how the regulations would evolve or what changes would be effectuated.

“I think there will be a big evolution. As to how this evolves in the coming years, we operate in the rules we have, I’m not gonna speculate on where the rules will go for regulated financial institutions, but we’re gonna continue to find ways to serve our clients as we move forward.”

Solomon’s remarks echo what was previously said by Jay Clayton, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s former chairman, on the same program. Clayton averred that the regulatory landscape is bound to evolve soon and tipped that new crypto regulations are on the way.

Goldman Sachs has made headlines over the last few weeks as it continues with its foray into the crypto space. It recently revealed that its private wealth management division was working on offering Bitcoin exposure to wealthy clients with assets over $25 million. The bank also resumed operations of its cryptocurrency trading desk and filed for a Bitcoin ETF last month.","Disclosure

CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group , which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups","Fidelity Investments, Square and Coinbase are amongst the firms that established a cryptocurrency trade group to lobby policymakers.

Leading cryptocurrency companies Fidelity Investments, Square, Coinbase and Paradigm are forming a cryptocurrency trade group. The trade group would help lobby policymakers to look at cryptocurrencies in a good light and promote innovation in the emerging sector.

First reported by The Wall Street Journal, The Crypto Council for Innovation aims to shape how Bitcoin and other digital currencies are regulated. According to the council, its mission includes demonstrating the “transformational promise of crypto and communicating its benefits to policymakers, regulators, and people around the globe.”

This latest development is a huge step forward for the cryptocurrency space as the council will lobby policymakers and commission research projects. The Crypto Council for Innovation wants to serve as a voice for the crypto sphere and champion the economic benefits for digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Crypto venture capital firm Paradigm is a key member of the group, and its co-founder Fred Ehrsam told the WSJ that the crypto space is currently at a mainstream inflection point. Ehrsam stated, “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage. It’s challenging because policymakers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade. It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board comprising members from each of the four participating companies. Ehrsam added that the trade group would appoint an executive team soon. The council’s launch comes at a period when cryptocurrencies are experiencing mainstream adoption.

Fidelity recently filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) while Coinbase is preparing to go public on the 14th of April, this year. Blockchain enthusiasts believe the technology can create jobs and extend financial services to consumers globally.","The Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange in mid-February has set off a chain reaction of competitors following suit. Funds once able to charge healthy premiums of 30 per cent or more than the price of Bitcoin itself are having to rethink their approach, with the largest—Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)—announcing this week that it also plans to convert to an ETF.

GBTC’s move follows those of Canada’s Ninepoint Partners and CI, which announced plans to convert their Bitcoin funds to ETFs shortly after Purpose’s product started trading. The short-term success of Canada’s ETFs has many predicting the demise of closed-end funds like the one offered by New York-based Grayscale with US$38 billion in assets under management, which subjected investors to extended lockup periods, high fees and restrictions on who can get in. And it’s given observers––who’ve watched the Securities and Exchange Commission reject digital currencies for years––hope that a similar product might finally be approved in the U.S.

Talking Point The success of Canadian Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is shaking up the market for cryptocurrency investment products, reviving hopes the U.S. might finally approve one. With more options available to investors, many are predicting the end may be near for exclusive closed-end funds that used to trade at large premiums to the price of Bitcoin.

Som Seif, chief executive of Purpose Investments, said he doesn’t mind seeing others benefit from the hard work he put in.

“If you’re working with a novel product, like Bitcoin, there’s a lot of wood to chop in terms of the amount of work to be done to make sure everyone gets comfortable,” Seif said. “We did a lot of that wood chopping.”

Bitcoin ETFs have been hotly anticipated by the cryptocurrency industry because they remove many of the barriers to entry, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts and add them to retirement portfolios. Closed-end cryptocurrency funds are less flexible and aren’t always eligible for RRSPs and TFSAs, although The Bitcoin Fund from Canadian digital-asset fund manager 3iQ is.

SEC commissioner Hester Peirce is anxious to start the process of bringing a Bitcoin exchange-traded product to the U.S. The SEC has some high-profile applications, including one affiliated with investment giant Fidelity, currently under consideration.

Peirce, who is affectionately known as “Crypto Mom” for her dissenting opinions of SEC rejections of Bitcoin ETFs, said she thinks Canada’s experience could serve as a model for her peers on the commission.

“Seeing what Canada is doing and watching the market reaction, and seeing how well the mechanisms work can be helpful to inform us as we move forward,” Peirce said. “While it’s probably not a direct, ‘Oh, well, Canada did it; we have to do it too,’ it’s more of a, “Canada did it? And hey, it’s working. And so maybe it would work here, as well.’”

While the SEC has dismissed Bitcoin ETF applications in the past over concerns of potential market manipulation and illicit activities, Peirce said she would rather investors had access to a regulated vehicle with oversight.

“I’m not going to advocate one way or the other on whether people should invest in a product like this,” she said. “But there’s a lot of interest in getting exposure in your portfolio to this asset class. So why not provide people a mechanism that they’re comfortable with, that they know how it works?”

Peirce said Canada’s Bitcoin ETFs demonstrate two important points: there’s a large market for them, and it matters who gets approved to go first. A month and a half after launch, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF leads the pack by far in terms of assets under management, with $1.24 billion, compared to $99 million held by competitor Evolve and $69.2 million held by the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, as of publication time.

“It’s a race to be first, as far as who’s going to win the approval of a Bitcoin ETF here in the United States,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “Those who have first-mover advantage tend to get the majority of the flow.”

William Cai, a partner at the New York-based asset manager Wilshire Phoenix, knows the pain of preparing a detailed application to the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF only to have it rejected over market-manipulation and investor-protection concerns, with the regulator turning his firm’s proposal down in February 2020. He said he’s less optimistic than some that an American Bitcoin ETF might be just around the corner.

“They’ve got the [environmental, social and governance] disclosures, they’ve got the people who made the noise on these meme stocks and Robinhood. They’ve got high-profile things that people are really pushing for,” Cai said. “Bitcoin, I just don’t see it happening this year.”

Meanwhile, Wilshire Phoenix is applying to launch another Bitcoin trust, with an eye on eventually converting it into an ETF. “That’s the way we’re keeping our options open,” Cai said.

In a recent tweet, Mike Novogratz, the billionaire founder of TSX-listed cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital Holdings, said he thinks the move toward ETFs and away from closed-end funds that Canada pioneered is part of a larger transition. Cryptocurrency’s promise has always been to eliminate middlemen and put people in charge of their own financial destinies—and Novogratz sees the decline of funds and trusts that limit access to the wealthy as a step toward that end goal.

“The ethos of crypto has always been about transitioning to a world that eliminates the rent takers,” tweeted Novogratz, who did not respond to a request for comment placed through Galaxy Digital. “I am keenly aware of the inherent contradiction of running a business while believing in eliminating rent takers.”

Fred Pye, chief executive of 3iQ, said he doesn’t agree that Bitcoin ETFs are superior to closed-end funds and will eventually replace them. His firm has applied for a new Canadian Bitcoin ETF in partnership with Jersey-based digital-asset management firm CoinShares that he expects will start trading this week, but he doesn’t intend to wind down or convert 3iQ’s existing TSX-listed product, The Bitcoin Fund.

Pye said investors who buy and hold Bitcoin in The Bitcoin Fund may find they’ve outperformed those who invested in ETFs by the end of the year. He said the two products each have pros and cons.

“The closed-end fund is an excellent product for investors who are looking to just buy and hold for a long period and hopefully outperform the price of Bitcoin,” Pye said. “Whereas people that want to be actively trading Bitcoin, they’re going to look for the most liquid, most efficient ETF.”

As 3iQ’s ETF and others come to market, the products will have to find ways to differentiate themselves in order to compete. The ETFs trading in Canada have been engaged in a marketing war by undercutting each other’s management fees, although the public won’t know which had the lowest overall management-expense ratio until they release their end-of-year filings.

“At the end of the day, I think talking about costs—differences of a few basis points between funds—is going to not be the relevant thing for investors,” said Elliot Johnson, chief investment officer with Evolve ETFs. “What they’re going to want to do is look over time and say, ‘Which of these products has actually tracked the price of Bitcoin accurately?’”

Even with more competition coming in Canada and possibly from the U.S., Purpose Investments’ Seif said he’s confident his first-mover advantage will hold.
