For the uninitiated, wBTC is the first ERC20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin.

WBTC marks the fourth collateral asset type to be added to the MakerDAO DeFi ecosystem. The former three included ETH, BAT, and USDC. wBTC will now be able to open Maker Vaults in order to generate Dai. The report added that:

“WBTC will help bring greater liquidity to the Ethereum and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, and to decentralized exchanges (DEXs).”

Pulling Bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain

Bitcoin holders can trade their BTC to open a vault and generate Dai through wBTC.

The process of opening a vault can be done on Oasis Borrow — a decentralized finance platform. The conversion takes 5 steps to complete. First users sign up to Coinlist, complete KYC, wrap BTC to wBTC, send wBTC to a compatible wallet, and then create a wBTC vault to generate new DAI, according to the report.

As Cointelegraph reported in early February, more than $1 billion U.S. dollars worth of assets resides in DeFi protocols. Crypto experts were reportedly sceptical about early adoption of Bitcoin within DeFi protocols, but also curious and interested to see how the future would evolve.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/countries-growth-cryptocurrency-coinmarketcap/,"9 Countries Show Huge Growth in Cryptocurrency Interest: Coinmarketcap

Coinmarketcap has revealed the top countries with the largest increase in the number of users. One segment shows the countries with the most user growth in the first quarter include India, Pakistan, Colombia, Canada, and Nigeria. The countries with the most female user growth include Greece and Romania.

46% Increase in Youth Users, Nigeria Up 211%

Leading cryptocurrency price and market data provider Coinmarketcap published a report Friday highlighting the crypto market and user trends for the first quarter of this year. The company explained that the data analyzed comes from its “proprietary market capitalization data and user insights from our massive user base.”

Besides the cryptocurrency price trends and discussions of events surrounding the March 12 crash, Coinmarketcap found two other trends it deems “promising.” The first is the quarterly growth of 43.24% of female users on its website and the other is the 46.04% quarterly growth of its youth users (ages between 18 and 24). The report details:

In relation to the youth user segment (aged 18-24), the continent of Oceania saw the biggest percentage jump of 151.95%, followed by Africa with 91.47%.

Specifically, Coinmarketcap named nine countries with the highest increase in users between the ages of 18 and 24 in the first quarter compared to the previous one. The nine countries with at least 80% user growth were led by Nigeria, which saw an increase of 210.6%, followed by Australia (158.07%), and Spain (120.71%). Other top countries were Canada (112.45%), Mexico (97.33%), the U.K. (91.48%), Colombia (85.07%), India (83.07%), and Pakistan (81.79%).

43% Increase in Female Users, Greece Up 164%

The number of female users has also risen substantially in the first quarter, Coinmarketcap revealed. “While we have consistently seen an increasing number of female users, this segment saw a particularly strong growth of 43.24% compared to the previous quarter,” the company clarified, elaborating:

Within the female user segment, the Americas and European regions grew more than 50% in users.

The company also named nine other countries with the highest increase in the number of women users in the first quarter compared to the previous one. Greece led the pack with a 163.67% growth, followed by Romania (145.09%), Argentina (98.23%), Portugal (89.95%), Indonesia (88.92%), Ukraine (86.68%), Czechia (85.6%), Colombia (82.03%), and Venezuela (80.23%). Furthermore, the company found a 41% increase in the number of users older than 65 years old.

Coinmarketcap’s website currently ranks 569th globally for site traffic and user engagement, according to Alexa’s ranking. In April, the company was acquired by Binance Capital Management, which operates one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms.

Really bad. This past week the U.S. reported Q1 GDP growth as -4.8%. Italy’s GDP fell -4.5%, Spain came in at -5.2% and France trumped that with a whopping -5.8%. And that’s just warming up – Christine Lagarde, head of the ECB, has warned euro-area GDP could fall by as much as 15% in Q2.

And yet stock markets in the U.S. and Europe closed up on the week, in spite of the inevitability the next quarter will be worse still.

This could be partly due to the concentration of market capitalization – nearly 25% of the S&P 500 market capitalization is from five tech companies, which arguably will do relatively well from more people staying at and working from home.

Or, it could be because the stock market has broken all ties with the actual economy. The aforementioned concentration of the S&P 500 is intensifying, fueled by the dominance of passive investing, which means its performance does not reflect that of most of its constituents. And the “moral hazard” posed by the government’s willingness to bail out companies in difficulty suspends the need to scrutinize balance sheets and evaluate viability. But reality doesn’t stay suspended forever, no matter how much we wish it would. Eventually the abrupt slowdown of economic activity will feed through to numbers investors can’t ignore, and the current price/earnings (P/E) valuations will start to look absurd.

This is where bitcoin comes in. Its underlying technology and monetary system make it one of the few investable assets that is immune to the economic fluctuations we have ahead.

First, its P/E ratios will never look absurd because it doesn’t have any earnings. Nothing to get hit there.

Second, its use will not be curtailed by lack of customer mobility – users can transact from anywhere. In fact, logistical constraints could boost interest in bitcoin transactions from those who normally hand over physical cash (although why they would want to if people aren’t moving around is another question).

Third, its market valuation is not susceptible to artificial support from governments trying to keep investor (and voter) spirits up.

This does not mean bitcoin’s price will keep going up while other prices come down. We saw back in March that when things get bad in markets, bitcoin also suffers. Its price is driven by sentiment.

But it is also driven by expectations of future adoption and demand, which are unrelated to the drivers of demand for most other investable assets.

In terms of fundamentals, bitcoin has nothing to lose in the upcoming crisis – no income, no debt and its future adoption does not depend on happy and confident consumers. Just the opposite, in fact.

The growing awareness of this, combined with heightened media attention due to the upcoming halving, could be one of the reasons behind this week’s recovery. Or perhaps it is being swept along in the wave of inexplicable optimism in traditional markets.

Should that turn south, bitcoin is likely to suffer in the sentiment-driven short term. Longer term, however, fundamentals tend to surface, and those that drive bitcoin are radically different from those that drive traditional markets.

Talk about marching to your own beat.

Not that big a deal

One argument in favor of the bitcoin price rallying after the halving is that of supply and demand. Assuming demand is more or less constant (I know, but work with me here), when supply drops the price should go up. Basic economics – you remember that graph from high school, right?

Source: Wikipedia

After the halving, there will be fewer new bitcoin entering the market every day. Since miners need to sell part of their hard-won new bitcoins to meet expenses, some of the sell pressure comes from miners. If they are selling fewer bitcoins (because they have fewer bitcoins to sell), then there is less supply meeting a constant demand and the equilibrium price moves up.

Fine, but one part of this model is already obviously unstable – demand is not constant, not by a long stretch.

Even so, there is another overlooked weakness: The dent in sell pressure is negligible.

Post-halving, there will be 6.25 fewer new bitcoins entering circulation with every block. Assuming a new block every 10 minutes, that translates to approximately 900 fewer new bitcoins a day.

Considering the number of bitcoins transferred on-chain in April was an average of over 270,000 per day, 900 less won’t make much of a difference to the supply curve in that simple basic price equilibrium graph.

Source: Coin Metrics

Any positive halving impact is more likely to come from increased awareness and trader interest resulting from the media attention. The juxtaposition of what is becoming known as a “quantitative hardening” against a “quantitative easing,” combined with growing unease about the latter, is likely to transform this media-fueled attention into a lasting interest from investors, analysts and economists. What is unclear is whether any price momentum from the halving would be enough to offset a hit to general sentiment from broader macro concern. As always in investing, one’s individual time horizon is everything.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

In spite of a stream of bad news on employment, production and earnings, the S&P 500 had its strongest April since 1987, possibly floating on the stimulus laughing gas. European indices also had a good month, as economies started announcing tentative steps towards opening up their economies and electricity consumption started edging up.

Source: Financial Times

As April turned into May, markets started to retreat, perhaps digesting the recent gains and perhaps unnerved by a new anti-China belligerence from the U.S. and earnings warnings from tech companies. Gold continues to play the inflation game but with less enthusiasm and some profit taking – it remains to be seen how it would perform if stocks head south again. And West Texas oil had its first positive week in about a month as confidence gathered around the production cuts, although there could well be more turmoil there as the next futures expiries approach.

As you can see in the chart above, bitcoin had a particularly strong month.

The jump this week gave bitcoin its best April in years, with data suggesting this rally is largely fueled by U.S. investors, with growth more in spot volumes than derivatives.

And a lack of foreign reserves has pushed countries such as Lebanon and Turkey towards currency crises, which remind us that a strong dollar impacts much more than just FX markets. What’s happening in Lebanon, where anti-government protests have turned violent and triggered the closure of the capital’s banks, will become a textbook example of the risks of centralized finance for years to come.

Chain links

CoinDesk Research has published its first in a series of deep dives into listed crypto companies. We’re starting with Hut 8, one of the largest listed bitcoin miners, and its financials and recent operational shifts reveal some of the hurdles bitcoin miners struggle with in capitalizing their business while maintaining margins.

Preston Pysh looks at investment opportunities in a market increasingly manipulated by government printing, predicting that a “break” will be triggered either by social unrest or a natural transition to a different form of money. TAKEAWAY: Preston is not a crypto enthusiast (among other things, he hosts the podcast “We Study Billionaires”), but he is bullish on bitcoin largely as an alternative to an increasingly debased dollar – this makes his take particularly interesting for those managing diversified portfolios, which should be everyone.

How many of a project’s contributors have to be hit by a bus for the project to stall? Introducing the “bus factor,” a new metric that measures resilience. Really. TAKEAWAY: Actually, it’s a cool concept, intriguingly expanded on here by analyst Hasu. The higher the bus factor (the more widely distributed the code development), the easier a network is to replicate. The lower the bus factor (the more concentrated its control), the greater the risk. A couple of years ago Twitter woke up to a mercifully false rumor that Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had been killed in a car accident. (It didn’t involve a bus as far as I know.) The news pushed ether’s price down 15%. These days the impact would probably be different (although please be careful, Vitalik), but the anecdote shows that this is a metric worth watching.

The city of Ya’an, in China’s mountainous Sichuan province, is publicly encouraging the blockchain industry to help consume excessive hydroelectricity ahead of the summer rainy season. TAKEAWAY: This highlights how excess energy from hydroelectric and natural gas plants can bring down operating costs for miners, making their sector – crucial to the maintenance of the bitcoin network – more profitable and less vulnerable to price swings and halvings.

Bitcoin futures and bitcoin options both had their most active day since the crash on March 12, according to derivatives data provider skew.com. TAKEAWAY: To be honest, I’m not sure what this means, but it feels significant.

Coin Metrics presents “free float supply,” which adjusts supply measurement by taking out founding tokens and vested tokens, as well as those that are inactive, burned or probably lost. TAKEAWAY: The result is a measure of circulating tokens, a more reliable gauge of a network’s size and liquidity. Bitcoin’s free float supply, according to Coin Metrics, is over 4 million less (over 20% less) than the reported figure, which implies that its velocity (the transaction rate compared to the amount outstanding) is higher than many have calculated.

Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has introduced a new metric called Glassnode On-Chain BTC Index (GNI), which aims to link price performance to network fundamentals. TAKEAWAY: Any fundamentals-tracking index is subjective, no matter how much rigor goes into selecting and quantifying the components. However, as long as the methodology is consistent, they can provide valuable information about trends and shifts, and at first glance the GNI does a good job of taking into account the principal value drivers of sentiment, liquidity and network health. The index recently turned from bearish to neutral, which is itself a bullish sign.

Large crypto investors, popularly known as “whales,” seem to be accumulating bitcoin amid the ongoing price rally. TAKEAWAY: Although an imperfect indicator, this can be interpreted as bullish, as high-net worth individuals or funds appear to be adding to or taking new long positions in bitcoin, perhaps in response to the monetary turmoil in the fiat world.

Genesis Capital* released its Q1 lending report, which highlights more than $2 billion of new loan originations, twice the figure for the previous quarter. This brings their cumulative amount lent to $6.2 billion. TAKEAWAY: Those are substantial figures, which point to a deepening maturation of the space. The report is worth a read, especially as it gives insight into the timeline around the March 12 crash, and how Genesis handled the turmoil. It also confirms that the lender has tightened credit, given the market uncertainty. This is likely to be temporary and comes as a relief – the sector needs strong lenders, as leverage can fuel growth but can also bring it tumbling down if it has to unwind suddenly. (*Genesis Capital is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, DCG.)

Leigh Cuen spoke to several crypto custody and wallet providers about the uptick in activity they have seen since the beginning of the lockdown. TAKEAWAY: Growing interest in off-exchange custody solutions implies a growing interest in holding crypto assets, rather than just trading them. Some of the exchanges Leigh spoke to cater mainly to institutional clients, but others have a wider base, which implies that interest in bitcoin is spreading amongst all types of investors.

The second fund of a16z’s crypto division has raised $515 million, more than the original target of $450 million and considerably more than the $300 million raised by the first fund, which launched in 2018. The investments will focus on next-generation payments, decentralized finance, new monetization models and the concept of a decentralized internet. TAKEAWAY: While this is a crypto venture fund, investing in startup equity and tokens without the intention to trade, this raise is bullish for the sector as it implies a belief that at least some of the beneficiary blockchain companies will have viable businesses.

Silvergate Bank added 46 crypto customers in the first quarter, bringing the total to 850, largely institutional investors. The number of transactions more than doubled in Q1 vs Q4, and was up more than 3x vs the same period in 2019. TAKEAWAY: One intriguing disclosure in the report was the mention of a lending service called SEN Leverage, currently in pilot mode, which will allow bank customers to obtain U.S. dollar loans collateralized by bitcoin. Crypto as collateral is a fascinating area to watch. On the one hand, the bearer status of bitcoin, its relative liquidity and its ease of transfer make it an ideal collateral from a lender’s point of view. On the other hand, current legislation makes it very difficult in practice. This paper by Xavier Foccroulle Menard, posted on SSRN this week, gives a great explanation as to why. (TL;DR: it’s to do with UCC definitions of collateral – guess what, bitcoin doesn’t fit.)

Hangzhou-based Ebang International Holdings, one of the leading manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of up to $100 million. TAKEAWAY: There does seem to be a trend amongst Chinese companies of trying to list in the U.S., in a bid to broaden their geographical diversification. Curiously, this could encourage the shift of the epicenter of bitcoin mining away from China and towards the U.S.

CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, one of the organization’s crypto supporters and who advocated for self regulation in the crypto industry, will not seek renomination when his post ends this month, and will leave the regulatory organization by late October. TAKEAWAY: SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who has argued in favor of bitcoin exchange-traded funds and also favors a more supportive approach to innovation, is also nearing the end of her term. As far as I know, her plans have not been made clear yet, and we don’t know who will be replacing Quintenz – but this could mark a subtle change in tone at one of the most powerful securities regulators.",2020-05-04 02:00:59+00:00,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitpay-vs-btcpay-which-bitcoin-payment-processor-is-right-fo-6453.htm,"Source: Adobe/Mateusz

Although most of the activity around bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies currently has more to do with price speculation than actual commerce, there are still plenty of reasons as to why accepting bitcoin payments makes sense for some businesses. Whether you believe in the ideas behind Bitcoin from a philosophical perspective or you just want to avoid chargebacks, there are plenty of benefits to be had from allowing your customers to pay for your goods or services via a cryptocurrency network.

BitPay and BTCPay Server are two of the most well-known options on the market in terms of enabling cryptocurrency payment acceptance for your business. However, they approach this problem from two different points of view.

Bitpay’s history and best features

Incredibly, BitPay was founded in the US all the way back in 2011 by Stephen Pair and Tony Gallipi. In fact, the company was launched less than two years after the launch of the Bitcoin network itself.

BitPay says its main mission is to transform the way individuals and businesses around the world receive payments through the use of blockchain technology. Many of the largest companies in the world that accept bitcoin payments, such as Microsoft and Newegg, do so via BitPay.

The company has processed more than USD 2.8 billion in cryptocurrency payments over the course of its entire history. Currently, the company processes payments made with BTC, bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum (ETH), XRP, and three different stablecoins.

Over the years, BitPay has expanded into other products and services that help enable better utility for BTC and other cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange. For example, in addition to their merchant payment processing offerings, BitPay also has a Bitcoin debit card, a Bitcoin wallet, and a number of open source tools for developers.

In 2014, BitPay gained some mainstream notoriety through their sponsorship of an NCAA (the National Collegiate Athletic Association) college football bowl game; however, the company decided to promote Bitcoin rather than their company specifically through the deal. More controversially, BitPay was one of the companies that supported the so-called New York Agreement in 2017, which was an attempt to implement a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin’s block size limit to go along with the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade. While many major Bitcoin miners, other large BTC companies were supporting this attempt, the majority of Bitcoin’s development community and other industry players were against it. Back then, they stressed that this scaling solution would make Bitcoin more centralized.

Best BitPay’s features:

Convert cryptocurrency into your local fiat currency with a flat 1% exchange rate to avoid price volatility

Merchants can choose to receive part of their payment settlement in cryptocurrency and another part in fiat currency

BitPay can be implemented into online stores built with Shopify, Wordpress, and other e-commerce platforms

BitPay has a customer support team

The company has a strong brand and has been around since 2011

Payments are private between merchants and customers

BTCPay Server’s history and best features

BTCPay Server was created in 2017 by Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier as an act of protest against BitPay’s activities around the aforementioned SegWit2x plan.

@BitPay This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsolete — Nicolas Dorier (@NicolasDorier)

BTCPay Server gives users more control over their payments than what is available with BitPay — it’s effectively a self-hosted version of BitPay. In fact, the BTCPay API conforms to BitPay’s configuration, which allows merchants to make the switch.

BTCPay Server comes with a full node wallet for its users, which means the original intent of Bitcoin in terms of censorship-resistance and full control over one’s money is preserved with this payment solution.

Best BTCPay Server’s features:

Support for SegWit, Lightning Network, and PayJoin payments

No approval process for merchants

Users have complete control over their bitcoin via full node software

Tor (an anonymous browser) integration available

No fees (besides cryptocurrency network fees)

Support for altcoins and sidechains via opt-in integrations

WooCommerce (an e-commerce plugin for WordPress) integration available

Which BTC payment processor is right for you?

Choosing the right BTC payment processor for your business will depend on a variety of factors. Although they are attempting to solve similar issues, BitPay and BTCPay approach bitcoin payments from two very different perspectives.

If you’re someone who just wants to enable BTC payments because you think it will attract new customers and you’re not actually interested in the ideas behind digital cash, then you may be better off going with BitPay. They’ll be able to turn all of your cryptocurrency payments into fiat currency, helping you avoid any volatility risk. Additionally, there is an actual company you can call for help in case anything goes wrong. (In case of BTCPay Server, you would need to ask the community for help and sometimes pay for it).

If you’re more interested in Bitcoin from a philosophical point of view, then you may want to take a closer look at BTCPay Server. While the company plans to introduce crypto to fiat conversion in an unspecified future, you can already convert your cryptocurrency payments on your own without permission from a company to enable payments for a cryptocurrency that is supposed to be permissionless in nature. In other words, BTCPay Server is for people who actually have a need for a form of censorship-resistant digital cash.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/onecoin-lawsuit-continues-judge-lifts-stay-order-investigators-search-for-crypto-queen/,"Onecoin Lawsuit Continues: Judge Lifts Stay Order, Investigators Search for 'Crypto Queen'

In mid-April, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the unsealed indictment tied to the Onecoin cofounder Sebastian Greenwood. At the same time, U.S. Judge Valerie Caproni had placed a stay order on the case against Greenwood, Konstantin Ignatov, Mark Scott and David Pike. Now Judge Caproni has lifted the stay and the court case against the defendants can proceed.

Onecoin Lawsuit in New York Continues – Stay Order Lifted

Court filings show that Judge Valerie Caproni has lifted the stay order, that temporarily suspended the case against the defendants Sebastian Greenwood, Konstantin Ignatov, David Pike and Mark Scott. According to court documents, Pike is being charged for bank fraud tethered to the Onecoin Ponzi’s operations. Documents also detail that the former attorney Scott is accused of laundering $400 million for Onecoin and the founder Ruja Ignatova, otherwise known as the ‘crypto queen.’ Ignatova remains at large but Scott, Pike, Greenwood, and the crypto queen’s brother Konstantin Ignatov have all been arrested. The lifted stay order states:

I Valerie Caproni, United States District Judge, whereas on May 1, 2020, the parties appeared for a teleconference with this Court; It is hereby ordered that the stay on this case is lifted. No later than May 8, 2020, the parties must jointly submit a proposed schedule for Defendants to answer, move to dismiss, or otherwise respond to the Amended Complaint.

Defendants Object to Stay Lift and the Relentless Search for the Crypto Queen

The reason behind the original stay is not confirmed, but many believe it had to do with the Covid-19 outbreak and the unsealed indictment stemming from Greenwood’s charges. Another court filing that was submitted on April 27, shows Scott and Pike have objected to the lift and they are hoping Judge Caproni favors their arguments. In the court filing written by the law firm Levi & Korsinsky LLP, most of the participants don’t seem to mind continuing a stay order “pending a final resolution of the criminal cases currently pending against each of them.” Moreover, the attorneys also said: Defendant Konstantin Ignatov’s Position: Defendant Konstantin Ignatov does not object to the continued stay of the proceedings requested by his co-defendants.

Some people believe that the stay was due to the 2017 disappearance of Ruja Ignatova. The hunt for the crypto queen has been relentless as the police and even armchair detectives have been hunting down her whereabouts. Investigators have searched for known friends, old phone numbers, and previous addresses. Ignatova was known to visit Schramberg, in Southern Germany often and she allegedly married a German as well. The town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria has been combed as well and people are searching Frankfurt on a regular basis too. This is due to the fact that the crypto queen loved Frankfurt and she had a daughter in the city back in 2016. Allegedly Ignatova’s former husband and biological daughter may still live in the German region.

During the hunt for Ignatova’s whereabouts, in April a report disclosed that a new Onecoin spinoff was created by one of the top members of Ignatova’s ranks. Le Quoc-Hung, otherwise known as Simon Le has allegedly started a project called Onelink. Law enforcement officials stumbled upon the Onelink project and Simon Le’s involvement while searching for the crypto queen. The website that uncovers a number of Ponzi operations, behindmlm.com notes that investigators think Le is hiding out in Vietnam or Dubai. Despite the aggressive search for Ignatova, global law enforcement has not found many clues to where she may be hiding. Konstantin Ignatov, her brother, has alluded to the possibility she is in Russia or Greece during his testimony a few months ago.

A serious hacking campaign is currently underway, and tens of companies have been hacked already, ZDNet has learned from security researchers keeping an eye on the attacks.

For the past 24 hours, hackers have been mass-scanning the internet for Salt, a type of software used to manage and automate servers inside data centers, cloud server clusters, and enterprise networks.

Attackers have been exploiting two recently-patched bugs to gain access to Salt servers and then deploy a cryptocurrency miner.

LineageOS hacked. Now Ghost.

Earlier today, ZDNet reported that hackers managed to breach the servers of LineageOS, a mobile operating system.

A second major hack surfaced a few hours later after our initial report. The second victim is Ghost, a Node.js-based blogging platform, built and advertised as a simpler alternative to WordPress.

In a status page, the Ghost developer team said they detected an intrusion into their backend infrastructure systems at around 1:30am UTC.

Ghost devs said the hackers used CVE-2020-11651 (an authentication bypass) and CVE-2020-11652 (a directory traversal) to take control over its Salt master server.

The blogging company said that while hackers had access to the Ghost(Pro) sites and Ghost.org billing services, they didn't steal any financial information or user credentials.

Instead, Ghost said the hackers installed a cryptocurrency miner.

""The mining attempt spiked CPUs and quickly overloaded most of our systems, which alerted us to the issue immediately,"" Ghost developers said.

Similar to LineageOS, Ghost devs took down all servers, patched systems, and redeployed everything online after a few hours.

Ransomware gangs expected to exploit bugs in the coming days

A security researcher who requested we not use his name for this report said the attacks were most likely carried out with an automated vulnerability scanner that detected outdated Salt installs, and then automatically exploited the two bugs to install the crypto-mining malware.

""It is very possible that the threat actor behind these scans doesn't even know the type of companies they're breaching right now,"" the researcher told ZDNet in a Twitter chat. ""We're seeing unpatched Salt servers at banks, web hosters, and Fortune 500 companies.""

""Pretty soon ransomware gangs are going to start scanning for this bug, and we're gonna see mayhem, with ransomware deployed at some huge targets.""

Some of these intrusions are currently being reported on a GitHub thread, with similar reports of an attacker planting a cryptocurrency miner on hacked Salt systems. Our source has identified the attacker behind most of these intrusions as the Kinsing botnet.

Saltstack, the company behind the Salt software, published patches earlier this week to address the two vulnerabilities. Companies are advised to either patch the Salt servers or secure them behind a firewall. There are currently around 6,000 Salt servers exposed on the internet.

Used as money in both ancient Greece and the Roman empire, gold was also the preferred method of payment for goods along the Silk Road. When modern banking emerged during the Italian Renaissance, the concept of paper money convertible into gold was invented. This practice ended a half-century ago, but the value of gold remains timeless.

Starting with England in 1717, modern nations began anchoring their national systems of money to gold in what became known as the “gold standard.” By the late 1800s, and until World War I, the most advanced economies were united in this approach. Today, although the money of nations is no longer anchored to it in any way, gold has retained considerable economic utility. Whether used to preserve savings or as a hedge against financial instability, gold has been a mainstay in individual, institutional and state portfolios.

Gold ownership is challenging

In spite of this storied history and the clear economic utility of a scarce asset, gold ownership remains challenging. Unlike fiat money in bank accounts or financial assets in investment accounts, stores of gold must be physically safeguarded against theft. As these volumes of stored gold increase, incentives for theft also rise, pushing the cost of secure custody higher. Another challenge is transportability. Theft must also be physically guarded against during transit, but eliminating this risk can be prohibitively expensive. Not everyone can afford an armored Brinks truck.

More challenges arise at the transactional level where the gold must be both verified for its authenticity and denominated in such quantities as to suit both the buyer and seller. Due to the high costs of purity testing and the difficulties of dividing physical gold, these constraints dramatically lower the potential for voluntary transactions between buyers and sellers. The potential for lower-value transactions suffers the most, as these buyers and sellers typically cannot rely on economies of scale to offset transaction costs. They may also prefer to use smaller and more precise denominations than the antiquated “gold bar.”

Together, these challenges create significant friction for both buyers and sellers of physical gold. These hurdles can be especially discouraging for smaller investors who may be dissuaded from ownership of the physical asset altogether. Popular gold-based financial products such as Exchange-Traded Funds, or ETFs, might then be used to gain some exposure, but this is not an economic equivalent to physical gold ownership.

What is the purpose of gold ownership?

Despite the challenges associated with physical ownership, gold markets continue to be among the most liquid in the world. Much like the geological deposits of this shiny metal, the demand for physical gold ownership is widely dispersed around the globe. The desirability of gold jewelry is universal, but so is the need to protect oneself from currency debasement and other financial turbulence. In countries where currencies are known to depreciate rapidly, it is far more common for citizens to hold their savings in physical gold rather than as money in a bank account.

Just weeks ago, amid the COVID-19 crisis, long lines could be seen forming outside of Bangkok gold shops as residents queued to sell their gold.

Because of work stoppages brought on by the health crisis, many Thai nationals sought to convert some of their savings into much-needed cash. The eight-year high Thai baht price of gold made this an especially attractive option and highlights the ultimate purpose of owning gold: exposure to the spot price of physical gold in terms of one’s own fiat currency. Whether it is a Thai shopkeeper protecting their savings, or a global hedge fund executing a complex investment strategy, the economic purpose of owning physical gold is the same: exposure.

Fulfilling the purpose while overcoming the challenges

The days of waiting in line to buy or sell gold may soon be over. While Bitcoin (BTC) has been heralded as “digital gold,” related innovations in blockchain technology are quietly shifting the paradigm of physical gold ownership. By leveraging this new technology, Tether Gold (XAUT) and other gold-backed stablecoins are fulfilling the economic purpose of physical gold ownership while overcoming many of the traditionally associated challenges. With a quickly growing market cap of approximately $86 million, XAUT has eclipsed PAX Gold (PAXG) to become the most widely held and circulated gold-backed stablecoin.

By embedding legal title to specific allocations of authenticated physical gold into a digital token, this highly innovative class of products combines the best of three distinct worlds:

(1) Direct exposure to the price of physical gold.

(2) The cost-efficiency and accessibility of traditional financial assets, such as ETFs.

(3) The transactional utility of a digital token.

Before gold-backed stablecoins, only the largest investors could avoid making stark trade-offs between (1) and (2) above. Everyone wants direct exposure to the price of physical gold, but at what cost? From the burden of securing physical storage and transportation to the added friction of purity-testing and low divisibility, it is easy to see how direct exposure has become prohibitively expensive for most investors. Unable to harness economies of scale, these investors are then priced out of physical ownership and priced into a synthetic proxy.

But margarine is not butter. Without traceable allocation to specific, authenticated and securely vaulted physical gold, these synthetic gold-based financial products can never amount to the real thing, no matter how popular they become. Today, through technical innovation and legal design, gold-backed stablecoins have been working to harness economies of scale for everyone. Now, for the first time in gold’s long history, investors can gain direct exposure to the price of physical gold without having to overcome the traditional associated costs and challenges. Physical ownership has been democratized.

The market impact of democratizing physical gold ownership

The benefits of gold-backed stablecoins extend well beyond the gains for individual buyers and sellers. The market as a whole is affected. John Bogle’s 1975 launch of the first index fund offered a similar value proposition to investors: democratization of diversified equity market exposure. Recognizing that the performance of actively-managed mutual funds could not justify their high fees, Bogle set out to offer low-cost, passive investment products by replicating the market at scale. These products’ popularity exploded in the ensuing decades, as individual investors began to recognize how much money Bogle’s invention could save them.

Despite these clear gains for individual investors, the long term impact of index funds on global equity markets has been ambiguous at best, and likely destructive. With passive investing strategies having grown to represent an ever-greater share of market activity, the proliferation of these index products has raised fundamental concerns over liquidity and price discovery within equities markets. Bogle himself recognized this problem later in his career, as he worried that the explosion of passive investing had opened the door to manipulation from speculators. Having designed index funds for long-term investors, Bogle remained dismayed into his final days by the speculative turn that the now-massive ETF industry had taken. Warren Buffet has described Bogle as the man “who has done the most for American investors,” but the jury is still out on what passive investing has done to American equity markets, something Bogel himself recognized.

Gold-backed stablecoins have flipped this story on its head. Cost-efficient ownership of physical gold has certainly been democratized but in a way that supports the long-term liquidity and price discovery within global gold markets. Whereas the growth of passive investment flows, as recognized by Bogle, would increase the susceptibility of equity markets to manipulation, the growth of gold-backed stablecoins would have the opposite effect. Since today’s gold markets are already dominated by “paper” — financial instruments with no direct connection to specific allocations of physical gold — the functioning and integrity of these markets can only improve as gold-backed stablecoins gain prominence.

With myriad advantages from both the individual and collective standpoints, gold-backed stablecoins really do allow the investing world to have its cake and eat it too.

He claims that Microsoft’s recent patent for a sensor-based cryptocurrency mining system using body activity data comprises the first-step in a satanic plot to microchip the human race.

On an episode of ‘Besogan TV,’ which roughly translates to ‘demon basher TV,’ Mikhalkov claimed the patent number of Microsoft’s cryptocurrency system — WO/2020/060606 — alludes to the occult nature of the technology.

“The 060606 part is somewhat alarming. You probably understand this, right? Is this a coincidence or an intentional selection of such a symbol, which in the Apocalypse of John is called the ‘number of the beast’ – the 666,” he stated.

Russian director promulgates coronavirus conspiracy

Mikhalkov claims that the system will manifest as a global program to microchip the population under the guise of the Bill Gates Foundation’s efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.

He claims that the program will be executed by Gates’ global “co-conspirators,” accusing Herman Gref, the head of Russian state-owned bank Sberbank, of being in on the diabolical scheme.

The episode was aired on the Rossiya 24 TV channel on May 1 before being removed from the channels schedule — prompting Mikhalkov to claim “censorship” on the part of the channel. After being posted online, the episode garnered 700,000 views in less than one day.

The conspiracy theory even garnered support from Russian politician and retired Tennis player, Marat Safin.

Conspiracy goes viral

The theory ignores the absence of any mention of microchips in Microsoft’s patent, obscures Gates' affiliation with the company after having stepped-down from the conglomerate’s board, and provides little explanation of the purpose of the microchipping program advanced by Mikhalkov.

As stated by RT. “Those who fear being forcefully microchipped by an evil corporation should probably first check their own pockets for a little ‘tracking device’ called a smartphone, which they have purchased and carry around voluntarily.”",,,,

But if historic patterns are anything to go by, the cryptocurrency could suffer a temporary price pullback following the supply-altering event.

The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 130% since bottoming out at $3,867 on March 13 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency jumped from $6,700 to $9,400 in the last 10 days of April alone. What’s more, prices gained over 15% last week to register bitcoin’s first seven-week winning streak in 12 months.

Notably, the big gains have happened in the weeks leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12, and are reminiscent of similar price rallies seen ahead of the previous two halvings, which took place in 2016 and 2012.

The term “halving” refers to a programmed-in event in bitcoin’s code, which reduces the reward per block mined by 50% every four years to control inflation. Following the upcoming halving, rewards issued will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC.

Bitcoin’s price performance ahead of halvings

Bitcoin appreciated by 34% from $9.5 to $12.75 in the four weeks to Nov. 28, 2012, when mining rewards were trimmed by 50% for the first time.

The cryptocurrency underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016. On that day, it was trading near $660, representing over 45% gain on the low of $440 observed in mid-May (though it peaked at $780 in mid-June).

Source: Coin Metrics

Bitcoin also witnessed unprecedented gains in 12 to 15 months following previous halvings. For instance, the cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.

Some observers expect bitcoin to chart a similar uptrend following the May 2020 supply cut.

“Halving will reduce the amount of bitcoin’s rewarded to miners, thereby reducing the supply of coins entering the market. Not only does halving boost the price as a result of the added scarcity, but the additional media attention and the positive impact this has had on bitcoin prices historically will drive up demand,” said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group.

Investors, however, should note that the previous bull runs did not start immediately after halvings. In fact, the 2016 halving was followed by a notable price drop.

Price performance after previous halvings

Bitcoin traded in a sideways manner for over two weeks following its second halving and fell to $465 on Aug. 2 – a loss of nearly 30% from the halving day price of $660.

Bitcoin's daily chart Source: TradingView

The fresh record high above $1,160 was set nearly eight months after the supply cut. The upward momentum gathered pace in the following months and prices reached $20,000 in December 2017.

Some investors would argue the cryptocurrency remained bid following its first halving on Nov. 28, 2012. However, back then the community was quite small and primarily consisted of “believers,” who cheered the first supply cut.

That said, prices rose only 6% from $12.75 to $13.50 in the two weeks after halving and remained sidelined in the following five weeks.

Pullback looks likely this time

“The bitcoin halving has been a long-standing topic among the crypto community, with many feeling that any influences on price have already been ‘baked’ into the current price range we’re seeing today,” said Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, a provider of financial services and exchange ecosystem.

Indeed, the event has been extensively discussed for over a year. CoinDesk published the first article regarding the May 2020 halving on Dec. 31, 2018.

On-chain data suggests both small and large investors are accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. As a result, a bout of profit taking may be seen after May 12. Some investors, especially short-term traders, may sell their coins after halving, putting downside pressure on prices.

One result of the halving is it will double the cost of mining. Hence, if there is a post-halving price pullback, older-generation mining machines like the Antminer S9s would yield losses, forcing miners to scale back operations or leave the industry. Hard-hit miners may offload their holdings to cover costs, adding to downside pressures around prices.

Some miners may take advantage of the recent price rise by liquidating their crypto earnings over the next 12 days. “That will allow them to keep accumulating bitcoin post-halving,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co.

This time is different

The May 2020 halving is different from the previous two events because it is happening against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis.

“This bitcoin halving will certainly be different to the last, as Satoshi Nakamoto’s economic system will have the opportunity to prove its resilience and strength in comparison with traditional Wall Street protocols,” said Andy Ji, co-founder of Ontology, the public blockchain and distributed collaboration program.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global economy and forced governments and central banks across the globe to add trillions of dollars of stimulus to the financial system.

The global economy was in relatively better shape when the cryptocurrency experienced its second supply cut in July 2016. Notably, China’s producer price index, or factory-gate prices, bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016 and turned positive in September of that year, triggering a reflationary bull market in commodities and equities.

Put simply, people currently have a strong reason to search for alternatives like bitcoin, which are getting scarcer with every halving. As a result, notable price dips, if any, could be short-lived and the odds of bitcoin setting new highs next year look strong.

“Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever-increasing monetary supply, which weakens the dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe it could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe havens away from traditional assets,” said Simon Peters, a crypto asset expert at global investment platform eToro.

Bitcoin struggles to pass $9K

While bitcoin has put in a

solid positive performance ahead of halving, the ascent seems to have run out

of steam over the past couple of days.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $8,650 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day, having failed to keep gains above $9,000 in the last four days, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The traditional markets are also flashing red on Monday, with futures tied to the S&P 500 reporting a 0.5% loss. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is drawing haven demand against the Chinese yuan and growth-linked currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars.

So investors are shunning risk, possibly due to the growing conflict over U.S. claims about China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. If the risk aversion worsens, bitcoin may extend the drop toward the 200-day average at $8,000.

Most analysts, however, still expect the cryptocurrency to test five figures ahead of the halving. “Though the initial surge to $10K stalled at $9,400, look for a further thrust to break the $10K level followed by a retreat post-halving, with constant forward progress through 2020,” said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital.

Chu added that institutional interest and engagement in bitcoin and crypto are at peak levels heading into the critical halving event.

Open interest or open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is considered synonymous with the institutional activity, rose to $339 million on Friday – the highest level since July 10, 2019, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The metric has risen sharply from the low of $107 million observed on March 12.",2020-05-04 10:30:00+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/05/04/pantera-ceo-predicts-bitcoin-btc-boom-to-115212-says-crypto-market-will-benefit-from-massive-money-printing/,"The CEO of one of the largest cryptocurrency investment firms says he believes Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of a long-term rally to more than $100,000.

In a new letter to investors, Dan Morehead says he believes that as governments increasingly print money to prop up their economies, the contrast between fiat and cryptocurrencies with fixed supplies will become increasingly apparent.

“This is a really distressing, massively confusing time. I have no idea what’s going to happen in 99% of things right now. However, I strongly believe it’s close to inevitable that this will be very positive for cryptocurrency prices.

My kids used to count to 100, ‘One, two, skip a few, a hundred.’ It feels like we’re doing that on Quantitative Easing. QE1, QE2, skip a few, a hundred. As Quantitative Easing approaches infinity, it simply has to have an impact on things whose quantity can’t be eased.”

As for Bitcoin, Morehead points to the halving, which will reduce the new supply of BTC in about a week, as a key factor that will drive a new bull run.

“Although there are only a couple of data points – and with the caveat that the past doesn’t predict the future – halvings have coincided with increases in price due to a perceived and/or real scarcity of supply.

The second halving decreased supply only one-third as much as the first. Very interestingly, it had exactly one-third the price impact. Extrapolating this relationship to 2020: The reduction in supply is only 40% as great as in 2016. If this relationship holds, that would imply about 40% as much price impulse – bitcoin would peak at $115,212 /BTC.

I realize that price may sound ludicrous to some today. But, $5,000 sounded equally ludicrous as our first written price forecast when we launched Pantera Bitcoin Fund at $65 /BTC.”

Some have predicted a “sell the news” type drop will hit bitcoin following the May 12 event. The dire prediction comes a week after bitcoin rose to the highest in more than two months. Traders and analysts cited growing demand for bitcoin before its latest halving.

The event will mean a 50 percent cut in the production of the cryptocurrency. The halving is one of the few observable events known to materially impact price. A rule written into decentralised digital currency's underlying code slashes the number of new coins awarded to the miners behind the global supply of bitcoin.

According to a report last week, iMiner has established its cryptocurrency mining operations in the Semnan Province of Iran with 6,000 ASIC miners. The company has invested around $7.3 million in its facility, becoming one of the largest known mining farms in the world.

With all its miners, the mining farm will produce a total hash power of 96,000 terahash per second. This means iMiner has probably installed all Aladin miners in its farm, each unit of which is capable of generating 16 terahashes per second, as seen on its website.

iMiner also offers cloud mining services, enabling customers to rent its hash power to mine Bitcoins.

Regulating the mining industry

Iran became one of the hotbeds of crypto mining due to low electricity costs. However, it also raised alarms among the government as it subsidizes electricity usage cost to the public.

To regulate the industry in the country, the Iranian government last year mandated licensing of mining farms operating in the country.

According to a report, the Iranian ministry issued licenses to over 1,000 Bitcoin mining farms last year.

iMiner received the license when the Bitcoin network is waiting to halve the mining rewards, giving merely 6.25 Bitcoins to for the addition of each block.

Many experts believe that this will make it hard for the small-time miners to survive in the Bitcoin mining industry and compete with the big players like iMiner.

Iran, however, made it clear that its licensing of the sector will allow both large and small miners to operate in the cryptocurrency mining industry.

Meanwhile, other giant mining farms are reporting impressive revenue figures for last year. Argo Blockchain mined around 1,330 Bitcoins over 2019, generating $10.78 million in revenue, while Hut 8, a Canadian Bitcoin mining company, reported total revenue of $58 million for last year.",2020-05-04 07:03:42+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-crypto-middle-east-consensus-distributed,"In advance of her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed, Leigh Cuen is writing a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world. In this first part of the series, she looks at the Middle East.

It is a truth universally acknowledged by pundits on Crypto Twitter that emerging markets are more likely to see revolutionary bitcoin usage, at least in the near future, than Silicon Valley.

However, the term “emerging markets” encompasses most of the planet, excluding a handful of wealthy nations. For instance, even if fiat-denominated volumes are dwarfed by Asian whales or U.S. institutions, scrappy crypto traders in Turkey have a disproportionate impact on the global bitcoin economy.

Generally speaking, regions with weak states and educated diasporas see more grassroots adoption. For example, Lebanese entrepreneur Michel Haber said most of the 26 remote workers involved with his web services startup, cNepho Global, now prefer bitcoin paychecks.

Haber has already been paying some developers this way – with bitcoin from Beirut’s grassroots trading networks – for two years. Now that most workers would rather receive bitcoin, he encourages colleagues to get mobile wallets.

This is no longer a fringe outlook.

The Arab Weekly ran a column in April about how the collapsed banking system is destabilizing Lebanon. Protests surrounded the central bank in April, and protests around bank branches even turned deadly. The situation continues to simmer.

“The peer-to-peer bitcoin market is very robust because the Lebanese banking system has failed and people have more cash than the banks do,” Haber said. “Because of coronavirus, you can’t really wait at the bank anymore. … They’re not sure the Lebanese bank will actually give them the money.”

This doesn’t mean bitcoin will easily replace local currencies, however. As witnessed in Iran, once home to a thriving bitcoin mining industry and retail usage, authorities curtailed usability once mainstream adoption grew.

But rather than stamp out demand for cryptocurrency, crackdowns may merely change its manifestation. Some people now use bitcoin for savings and altcoins for transactional alternatives. Markets in places like Iran and Argentina now see increasing demand for stablecoins.

Likewise, Argentinian crypto exchange founder Federico Ogue, CEO of Buenbit and Buendolar, said many users who are buying cryptocurrency for the first time are attracted to dollar-denominated stablecoins.

More coverage on cryptocurrency in the Middle East:

Stablecoin volatility

In regions with volatile currencies and scant access to dollars, demand for stablecoins is up.

According to a bitcoin trader in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for safety, plummeting oil prices haven’t increased local demand for bitcoin. This is partially due to government efforts to promote the local stock market. Yet, as the dollar exchange rate fluctuates and paper bills become scarce, Tether stablecoins (USDT) sell for more than a dollar’s worth of Iranian rials.

“The government is trying to push financial market demands into Tehran stock exchange to avoid increasing demands in currency or gold markets,” the anonymous Iranian trader said. “Local [crypto] exchanges changed [USDT] rates artificially to get more profit, also demand was so high compared to the low supply of USDT in peer-to-peer exchanges.”

The most desirable aspect of the stablecoin isn’t any stability mechanism or collateral, it’s simply the network effects. After all, the reason many of these users turn to cryptocurrency is because they want a global asset, regardless of whether that takes the form of paper bills or software.

Dapps

The Middle East is also one of the few regions where decentralized applications (dapps) that aren’t focused on gambling are still attracting routine users.

Dmail founder Mohamed Abdou, whose Egyptian team built a privacy-centric email service using Blockstack, said the dapp now has 15,000 active monthly users. As such, Dmail raised a $500,000 seed round in April, an amount which goes much further in Cairo than Silicon Valley.

TenX’s popular Visa debit card—which lets you spend cryptocurrency without having to manually top up—has launched in Germany and Austria.

It supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), all of which can be spent anywhere that accepts Visa thanks to the card’s unique auto-convert ability.

In an ideal world, we’d be able to spend any cryptocurrency, anywhere we shop. But, in reality, merchants aren’t quite there yet. Luckily, TenX is here to help. Bridging the gap between blockchains and traditional fiat currencies, the TenX Visa debit card lets you spend cryptocurrency like it’s cash.

Following high demand, the card recently got the green light (in the form of an E-Money License) to launch in Germany and Austria, where it will serve a combined population of over 90 million people. So how do you know if the TenX Visa Card is right for you? Here, we’ll cover the perks of owning one to help you decide.

Move over, manual top-up: auto-convert is here

The TenX Visa Card does things differently. Unlike most competitor cryptocurrency cards on the market, which are essentially prepaid cards that you need to keep manually topping up with cash, the TenX Visa Card doesn’t need topping up at all. Instead, it auto-converts your cryptocurrency into cash at the very moment you make a payment.

“Part of the TenX mission is to help the world access cryptocurrency simply and safely, supporting users on their journey into the space by making it as easy to spend cryptocurrency as it is to spend cash,” says Toby Hoenisch, CEO and Co-Founder at TenX.

Whether you’re getting groceries in-store or renewing your Netflix subscription online, when you make a payment, the merchant receives it in their local currency. This instant, automated conversion allows for a seamless transaction—one that is just as easy as paying with a regular debit card.

Switching up your crypto spends

The TenX Visa Card and TenX Wallet App go hand-in-hand. When you make a card payment the funds come straight from your connected wallet app, with TenX working their magic behind the scenes to auto-convert your cryptocurrency. These payments can be tracked in-app (much like a neobank app lets you track your money), and you can also use it to lock your card should it go missing.

In the app there are three different wallets, one for each supported coin: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). You can set any of these as your primary wallet—the wallet you make payments from—in the app settings, and TenX plans to add support for more cryptocurrencies in the future.

Anywhere Visa goes, TenX goes too

The TenX Visa Card enjoys all the features of Visa. Thanks to 3D secure—an added layer of real-time security—payments are protected against fraud. And, with over 54 million Visa-accepting merchants stretching across more than 200 countries, you can pay with your TenX Visa Card all around the world.

In addition, the card can also be used to withdraw money from ATMs, which is useful for traveling abroad or simply when you’re out and about. There is a fixed fee of $3.25 USD for doing this and, as usual, banks may also charge additional fees—so it’s wise to make yourself aware of this before you go ahead and withdraw any money.

Spend, buy, rinse, repeat

When you’re spending cryptocurrency, you’ll no doubt want to buy more. TenX has a solution for that too, as Toby explains: “We are thrilled to be able to once again serve customers in Germany and Austria. Our approach to re-launching our card is coupled with a brand new feature within the TenX Wallet app that makes buying crypto super simple.”

If you’re based in Australia or Europe you can benefit from this feature right now, with support for more countries in the works. Alternatively, no matter where you’re based, you can add more cryptocurrency to your TenX wallets by sending it from another wallet. It’s worth noting that here that, for the sake of security, TenX recommends you limit the amount of cryptocurrency held within your wallets to a week’s worth of expenditure.

Ready to become a TenX cardholder?

In light of the current economic climate, TenX is giving the Bitcoin.com community a boost by waiving its card issuing fee. This means, from now until May 31st, you can save $15 USD and get your TenX Visa Card for free using discount code TENXBCOM.

Your card is then free to use for the first year and, following that, it’ll remain free if you spend over $1,000 USD each year (otherwise there’s a small annual upkeep cost of $10 USD).

To get your TenX Visa Card, download the TenX Wallet App. If you’re located in a supported region (Germany, Austria, or Asia Pacific), you’ll be able to order it through the app. Otherwise, you can register your interest in-app to get notified when the card launches in your region.

CampdenFBput some of the key questions families have on crypto—issues of risks, rewards, trends and security—to Patrick Lowry (pictured left), chief executive and managing partner at Iconic Holding.

“Our research, conducted together with our academic partners at Germany’s leading finance education institution, the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, indicates that even just a 1% allocation to crypto, rebalanced monthly, from a standard family office portfolio, would have yielded a Return on Investment double that of the standard allocation over the past five years,” Lowry said.

What personally and professionally inspired you to venture into cryptocurrency and launch Iconic Holding with Maximilian Lautenschlager (pictured right), co-managing partner?

The inspiration for Iconic came from my time working on the VC team at Deutsche Borse. We were investing into early-stage blockchain companies that had strategic value for the Borse as one of Europe’s leading stock exchange operators. Drawing on this inspiration, I reached out to my MBA colleague and friend, Max, and together we launched Iconic Lab as an early-stage crypto VC and accelerator.

Iconic Lab was and is wildly successful, however, some of our larger investor groups wished to have exposure to blue-chip crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but did not know how to invest. Given my background as a PwC auditor of such clients as Vanguard and Blackrock, I suggested we launch an index fund group for crypto assets. Together with Christian Angermayer and Mike Novogratz’s Cryptology Asset Group, we launched Iconic Funds to create investment vehicles for investors to gain passive exposure to the growth of crypto assets.

Iconic Holding became the rebranded name of the parent company of Iconic Lab and Iconic Funds.

What is Iconic Holding’s USP in the crowded crypto market, why is it the underdog?

Iconic has always been a first-mover, whether it be by entering the blockchain VC space early or by becoming Europe’s first fully-licensed and regulated crypto index fund provider. We further cemented this position by filing a prospectus for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Note, which if approved, would be the world’s first Bitcoin ETP to be admitted to a Regulated Market.

However, our true USP is our traditionalist approach to crypto asset management. Iconic does not want to push its own arbitrage or long/short strategies like most crypto asset managers. Rather, we focus on educating investors on the merits of crypto as an asset class that every investor should have a small allocation to. To facilitate this, we have built institutional-grade investment vehicles that offer passive and diversified exposure to crypto, providing investors the quality assurances they deserve from a world-class asset manager. Further, we aim to be the cost leader, with even our planned Bitcoin ETN earning no management fee for at least the first year of its existence.

What is the biggest myth about cryptocurrency that needs debunking?

The most prevalent myth behind crypto assets is that they have no underlying value and are purely for speculative traders. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Take Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, for example. Bitcoin is the world’s hardest money. While the technology behind it is not yet scalable to facilitate micro-payments, Bitcoin is currently the fastest and cheapest manner to transfer large values between two counterparties, and it is done without a bank or intermediary. Coupling this with its inherent deflationary nature (only 21 million will ever exist), it is easy to see where Bitcoin derives its value from. In fact, Bitcoin can easily be modeled and priced using its stock-to-flow ratio, similar to other commodities, as highlighted in the following article: Modeling Bitcoin's Value with Scarcity.

The other biggest misconception is that people can create new cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, out of thin air. While technologically possible, a cryptocurrency is only worth the trust people place in it, similar to fiat currencies. To compare, a paper dollar does not inherently have value, but the ecosystem around it and government backing make it trusted, and thus, valuable. Similarly, the cryptographic technology and mathematics backing Bitcoin make it trusted by its community, and thus, valuable.

How is cryptocurrency performing during the coronavirus pandemic—will it make or break the digital asset?

Make no mistake, 2020 is the year Bitcoin validates itself due to the economic fallout of Covid-19 pandemic.

Historically, Bitcoin and crypto as an asset class, is uncorrelated to traditional markets. While there are short bursts of correlation, such as in March during the immediate market effects of the pandemic, crypto has historically proven itself as non-correlated asset class for over a decade.

Further, as I touched on earlier, Bitcoin is the world’s hardest form of money. This is in contrast to central bank issued fiat currencies, such as the dollar, euro or sterling, which are “soft money” due to their ability to be infinitely printed by a central authority. As trillions of fiat money is printed to combat the economic crisis to artificially inflate the economy, it will inevitably fall victim to inflation.

Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to combat the economic and fiat fallout due to its hard, deflationary nature. Wise investors use such assets as hedging instruments when constructing their portfolios.

For anyone interested to learn more in detail, I recently wrote an article which details the opportunity Bitcoin has in 2020: Bitcoin's Perfect Storm.

What are risks and rewards for families investing in cryptocurrency?

Before investing into crypto, I always recommend everyone to thoroughly research the topic and inform their own thesis. You should understand what you are investing into before jumping in into anything, but this is especially true of crypto.

Crypto is a very nascent technology with immense upside and risk. Because of this, you should treat it very similarly to a venture investment where you are fully prepared to lose your entire investment. This is why we recommend only a small portion of any investor’s portfolio be allocated to crypto, and that you enter for the long haul, rather than to “get rich quick” as some would have you believe crypto has the ability to do.

The upside, however, is longterm exposure to a non-correlated, deflationary asset class that acts as a premium hedging instrument in any portfolio. If properly managed, a crypto allocation may ensure the construction of a balanced, well-structured and diversified global portfolio.

How secure and reliable is crypto?

The blockchain itself, through the use of cryptographic technology, is an unhackable, immutable and transparent distributed ledger. While cryptocurrencies are built utilising the indisputable safety of blockchain technology, there are still risks around the real-world management of cryptocurrencies, such as wallet and transactional management, which are exposed to hacks.

One of the biggest issues in crypto is that, when transferring crypto between wallets or storing the assets on an exchange, they are susceptible to be stolen due to hacks, never to be recovered again. This is only a risk if the wallets are improperly managed by individuals or the exchanges themselves. It is imperative that anyone who wishes to invest into and hold crypto on their own is fully capable of managing warm and cold-storage devices, multi-signature wallets and their own private keys. While this is completely secure and reliable when done well, most people do not have the technological knowhow to do so and should rely on a professional crypto asset manager to manage and safekeep their crypto investments.

Where are you focusing your crypto investments at the moment and why?

The data is incontrovertible; every investor should have a small percentage of their overall portfolio allocated to crypto assets.

Our research, conducted together with our academic partners at Germany’s leading finance education institution, the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, indicates that even just a 1% allocation to crypto, rebalanced monthly, from a standard family office portfolio, would have yielded a Return on Investment double that of the standard allocation over the past five years. Further, the risk-adjusted return on investment for the same allocation in a standard family office portfolio, reflected by a Sharpe Ratio, was nearly double as well, even with crypto’s notorious volatility. Crypto needs to be a part of every investor’s portfolio.

This is why we are focusing our investment thesis in crypto on passive, diversified exposure for all investor types. Our crypto index vehicles allow investors such exposure at industry leading low costs. We want to be the catalyst that drives the institutionalisation of crypto as an asset class, and we believe our indexed investment approach is the best opportunity to accomplish this.

Where do you want to see Iconic Holding in five years’ time?

Iconic’s mission is to bridge the traditional and crypto financial markets. We aim to be the world’s leading crypto asset manager, but we are not just stopping there.

Core to Iconic’s beliefs is that every financial instrument, such as stocks, bonds and derivatives, even funds themselves, will inevitably be tokenised. As the future Apples and Amazons of the distributed economy issue cryptographic shares on the blockchain, Iconic’s ambition is to leverage the same professionally managed cryptocurrency investment vehicles we have for Bitcoin and others today for future tokenised crypto assets.

The marriage of state-of-the-art technology, innovative investment products and uncompromising professionalism places Iconic at the vanguard of crypto asset management, and in five years’ time, we not only aim to be the leading crypto asset manager, but one of the premier asset managers in the world.

What is your message to the Campden Wealth community?

I would just like to conclude by saying how excited the Iconic team and I are to be joining the Campden community! We very much look forward to meeting you at future events and helping educate anyone interested on crypto assets and their value drivers.

A Polish blockchain company says that its user numbers are up despite the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic, and says that investors are flocking to a gaming sector that is booming – in spite of the health crisis pandemic.

GamerHash says that building on improved results it is now eying expansion to Asia, and also wants to launch its own token.

Owned by the Poznań-based company CoinAxe, GamerHash purports to allow users to share excess computer power when PC users watch movies, play games in play-and-earn model sessions or browse the internet – using leftover power to mine cryptocurrencies.

With more than 450,000 users registered in 125 countries worldwide, the start-up says it has noticed a significant increase in user activity since the coronavirus lockdown was initiated in Poland, its largest market.

Poland was one of the first European Union nations to close its borders in the wake of the outbreak’s spread to Europe, and much of its population has been in lockdown for the past six-seven weeks.

Artur Pszczółkowski, the start-up’s chief managing officer and co-owner tells Cryptonews.com,

“We have noticed a 70% increase in user activity per day since the pandemic began, and our platform now attracts about 15,000 users per month. We’ve also noticed a surge in interest from both domestic and foreign investors. We’re currently in the process of closing a seed funding round, and I spend about 10 hours a day talking to investment fund operators.”

Pszczółkowski adds,

“Gaming, e-commerce and streaming are the three sectors that are attracting massive interest from investors during the pandemic, but the latter two are already dominated by major players, and investors know that it is challenging to find undervalued opportunities there.”

However, Pszczółkowski says GamerHash’s core business is cryptocurrency mining. He says that the company’s prime pitch to users is the following: Make crypto while playing your favorite games or watching movies.

The CMO claims,

“We let anyone earn crypto, often in the range of USD 20 to 30 per month, solely by using the capacities of their computer’s CPU and GPU. Our algorithms analyze users’ devices, checking to see which cryptocurrency best fits their computer’s technical specifications. Many of our users don’t even care which crypto they mine as long as they are rewarded!”

The GamerHash executive adds,

“We offer them various ways to spend crypto: We operate a marketplace with 600 digital products, such as Netflix subscriptions. And we also allow users to store their crypto in their wallets, or spend tokens through an app that allows them to make use of use QR codes to shop for groceries at local stores.”

The platform’s users, says its operators, can mine 12 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), ravencoin (RVN) https://cryptonews.com/coins/ravencoin/ and monero (XMR).

As mentioned, in the near future, GamerHash is also aiming to launch its own token.

The CMO states, “We have established a subsidiary in Malta that will launch the token, and we’re currently finalizing a seed funding in parallel with this.” He states that the round could raise “up to USD 2.8 million.”

He states that the company has not yet started the first phase of its private toke sale. However, Pszczółkowski states that the company “already has commitments for USD 150,000” with “a few bigger tickets” with “further commitments incoming” – meaning that reaching a soft cap of USD 1.2 million “should be easy.”

Pszczółkowski adds,

“During the summer, we will allow people to buy our token via our ambassadors. As a next step, after the summer, GamerHash will list the token on a number of partner exchanges in Europe and Asia. We have already concluded these talks.”

While Poland remains the start-up’s main market, in the long-term, GamerHash plans to tap into the potential of Asian markets – the main objective of its current fundraising activities with venture capital investments.

The co-founder explains,

“In Europe, cryptocurrency mining is expensive because of its high electricity prices. Our focus is now on Asia, and we’re cooperating with a VC fund from Singapore to expand there. We want to set up a subsidiary in Singapore to facilitate our expansion to various Asian markets, including Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore. Japan is also on our list, but it’s a difficult market. As such, it is best to first secure a foothold in other countries and have a good track record there before eventually setting up shop in Japan.”

The company even has its sights set on the biggest Asian player of all: the Middle Kingdom.

“China is a huge market,” concludes the CMO, “But, because of its regulatory instability, it makes more sense to be an established player before you launch your business activities there.”

As reported, crypto-focused startups will need to work harder for their funding while more emphasis to be placed on having working products with actual customers.",

Prices rose to a high of $9,112 at 05:05 UTC, extending a recovery from Monday’s low of $8,528. At press time, the cryptocurrency had dropped back to near $8,850 on major exchanges, representing a 1.9% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

While the cryptocurrency found dip demand on Monday, the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses active on the network, as sender or receiver, rose to 932,274 – the highest level since June 29, 2019, according to the data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

The non-price metric has risen by nearly 40% from lows observed in March and likely represents an influx of bitcoin investors, according to analysts.

“There is more media [attention] around the halving, which is causing more account openings; we’re seeing that on the retail side too,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving next Tuesday, following which the rewards per block mined will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC. The impending supply cut has been hailed as a long-term bullish development by many analysts.

The hype surrounding the halving, coupled with the drop below $4,000 seen in mid-March, may have enticed existing investors to add more coins to their wallets and new investors to dip a toe in the cryptocurrency space. This is evidenced by the fact that unique active addresses began rising in the second half of March.

“We have observed a significant increase in ‘new money’ entering the ecosystem. Several exchanges and retail platforms are reporting a surge in Bitcoin deposits, new signups, and credit card purchases since the low that took place on March 13,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

While the ecosystem looks to be expanding, each unique active address does not necessarily represent a single investor or user. A single person or an exchange can hold multiple addresses. Large investors, popularly known as whales, could buy, say, 10,000 bitcoins and hold them in many addresses.

Looking ahead, observers expect the number of active addresses to continue rising post-halving. “We’ll see higher account openings at the end of May if we go through $10,000,” said Thomas.

If history is a guide, though, the cryptocurrency has potential to see a price pullback post-halving. It fell nearly 30% in the four weeks following its second halving on June 9, 2016.

Meanwhile, Dibb expects active addresses to reach levels seen during the height of the previous bull market in December 2017 on the back of continued retail demand and adoption by new entrants. The seven-day average of active addresses clocked a record high of 1,190,302 on Dec. 18, 2017, the day the cryptocurrency clocked a lifetime high of $20,000.

As far as the cryptocurrency’s price is concerned, volatility is expected to rise as we head into the halving.

“The push above $9,000 seen this morning is positive and could be the first indication that we have now started the run into the halving. Parts of Asia (Japan and China) were off today, but when they return tomorrow we will be just a week away from the halving so we can expect to see an increase in volatility,” said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of the cryptocurrency platform Luno, earlier on Tuesday.

From a technical standpoint, the cryptocurrency’s repeated failure to keep gains above $9,000 is indicative of buyer exhaustion and suggests scope for a price pullback, possibly to $8,000, as discussed on Monday.",2020-05-05 11:17:37+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-post-covid-pre-halvening-4-leading-experts-open-up-on-btc/,"The coronavirus has had a very strange effect on time–certain aspects of our lives have been sped up, and others have slowed down; in many ways, the same thing that can be said for crypto: the coronavirus crisis has been a sort of ‘stress test’ for the industry on many levels–as a result, we’ve seen wild volatility, infrastructural issues, and generally, the vulnerabilities of the crypto ecosystem have been laid bare; at the same turn, the path forward for crypto may be clearer than ever.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

Finance Magnates is pleased to announce the completion of first-ever in a series of online cryptocurrency-focused webinars. On Monday, May 4th, we discussed the coronavirus and its effects on cryptocurrency with four leading experts in the crypto space. To listen to the full discussion of the session, which was entitled ‘COVID-19 & the Cryptosphere: Threats, Opportunities, & Long-Term Effects,” click the SoundCloud or YouTube links below.

Two of yesterday’s panellists are leaders from companies that are members of the Libra Association, the organization that supports the development of Facebook’s Libra network: Joe Lallouz, founder and chief executive of blockchain infrastructure firm Bison Trails, and Marc Bhargava, president and co-founder of cryptocurrency prime brokerage Tagomi.

The panel also featured two experts from other prominent aspects of the cryptocurrency industry, including Zac Prince, chief executive of NYC-based cryptocurrency lending firm BlockFi, and David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain. David is also a prominent cryptocurrency journalist and historian.

David Gerard: Crypto is “functionally a bit of a dollar derivative.”

The discussion began with a discussion about what has been revealed about the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a result of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.

“The thing about the COVID-19 crisis is that it was the end of the ‘long bull run’: after the 2008 crisis, we basically had a decade where stocks just went up. That ended all of a sudden in one, big bang,” David Gerard said.

“Everybody took all their money out of everything else, and put it into the ‘asset of last resort’ in a crisis, and that asset turned out to be dollars–buying up treasuries, or just getting cash.”

Additionally, conventional markets “just completely went nuts–nobody knows what anything is worth anymore. Stock prices make no sense at the moment.”

And “crypto crashed as well.”

David explained that this is because “the great difficulty that crypto continues to have is that there really isn’t really a crypto economy–there’s no circular flow of income; no one ‘lives their lives’ in crypto. As an investment, it’s functionally a bit of a dollar derivative.”

“[…] So, the lesson there is that everything crypto did, it did during the best possible conditions: when markets were going up, investments were all looking good…now, it’s the bad times, and crypto really has to make a case–and I’m really not seeing it make one at the moment.”

Zac Prince: Dollars are “sucking the life out of everything else.”

Zac Prince responded: “I think you brought up a really interesting point about the flight to dollars–that’s very accurate…dollars are going to be the biggest thing moving around the crypto economy or the crypto ecosystem over the next one to five years.”

“Historically, it’s been kind of a challenge in the industry for some folks to square that as a concept, because a lot of the most hardcore cryptocurrency believers will say things like, ‘cryptocurrency is going to replace the dollar’ and ‘fiat currencies are total trash’–I believe the exact opposite.”

In fact, “I believe there’s a great sucking sound in the world economy, and it’s dollars sucking the life out of everything else.”

However, “what’s unique about the cryptocurrency industry, and specifically the payment rails that are created by some of these networks (like Ethereum), is that it enables people to move dollars around at a speed and scale that was simply not possible using the traditional banking ecosystem.”

As a result, “you’re going to see more and more people do things that the used to do more expensively with the traditional banking system, or not be able to do at all with the traditional banking system–[they’ll] move into the traditional crypto world, [and] get one step closer to Bitcoin.”

Zac also pointed out that Bitcoin is nearly back to the price point that it was hovering around in the pre-corona days: “[Bitcoin] has rebounded better than the stock market, performed better than gold this year…there might be a big benefit to Bitcoin for not being as connected to the traditional system as other assets are.”

Joe Lallouz: The upcoming Bitcoin halving may be heavily influenced by trading infrastructure

With regards to Bitcoin’s price, Joe Lallouz also shared his thoughts about the possible effects of the upcoming Bitcoin halving or ‘halvening’ that is scheduled to take place next week. Halvings are regular occurrences in which mining rewards on the Bitcoin network are cut in half; some analysts believe that these events inevitably lead to price increases.

Joe Lallouz explained that “Compared to previous halvings, where folks are looking at the history and saying ‘look at the previous halvings–[they resulted] in serious price adjustments, most of which were upwards,’” which is to say that “the Bitcoin price has been mostly tied to the activity in the network.”

However, the Bitcoin trading landscape has evolved since the last halving, which took place in 2016. “Right now, a lot of the activity is margin trading in places like BitMEX,” Joe said.

In other words, “in previous halvings, there wasn’t the infrastructure around trading that we have today, and so there wasn’t the opportunity for margin trading on BitMEX to dictate the price [when the last halving occurred.]”

“It’s a different world, and we’re seeing it progress,” he added.

However, “what’s actually a good thing is that we are seeing the markets sort of adjusting to the platforms that exist, the trading activity that exists, the mining activity that exists, the purchasing activity that exists.”

How will this affect the price of BTC? “[…] It’s very possible that the halving is already priced in, or that the trading activity is dominating any kind of mining activity that would be dictating the price–we don’t actually know.”

Marc Bhargava: The halving will have an important “narrative effect” on Bitcoin

Marc Bhargava also brought up the similarities and differences in circumstances surrounding Bitcoin halvings in the past.

“If you look at the last halving in 2016 and the year that followed,” that time period “was also the rise of Ethereum,” he said. “There was a lot of excitement around it: the community, the building–those two things were so clearly connected, and kind of moved prices together in the subsequent year of 2017.”

“So, I think that in terms of the halving in and of itself, there definitely can be a positive narrative [with] a lot of press; it can also be a negative narrative (i.e. ‘nothing’s happening during the halving, I thought that was supposed to be the moment–should we all get out of this?’)”

“There certainly will be a narrative effect–a PR effect–and that could go either way, in my opinion; I think more important are other confounding variables that could come in around use cases, around tech and development and things like that.”

“If there are those things, and there is an increase in demand, then, of course, a cutback in supply could cause a very noticeable change,” Marc continued. However, “I guess I’m a bit more ‘demand-focused’ on it in terms of use cases and daily trading activity.”

Marc specifically pointed to “what’s going on on BitMEX and some of the exchanges that are tied to the index BitMEX uses.”

“It’s very true that [this trading activity] drives a lot of the volatility, but I think in terms of longer-term price trends…you find that there’s a base community [of users and traders] to take into account.”

According to a poll by crypto services firm RockX on May 4, 57% of Chinese miners expect a large number of new Bitcoin buyers to join the market in the near future.

RockX claims to have polled 42 prominent Bitcoin miners and members of the Asian mining community. Respondents include F2Pool chief operating officer Yu Chao, TokenInsight partner Wayne Zhao, Pandaminer and OXBTC CEO Wilson Guo and Bitmain APAC head of sales Fan Xiaojun.

Over 71% of the respondents also believed that the market has regained its confidence in Bitcoin. Furthermore, 45% of respondents believe that in the next six months, Bitcoin’s price will be between $10,000 and $12,000, nearly 24% think it will stay around $10,000 with low volatility and over 14% believe BTC will be worth over $15,000.

Miners’ outlook on profitability is optimistic

Most (over 57%) of the respondents also believe that Bitcoin’s hashrate won’t change significantly after the halving, and expect it to be between 110 and 130 exahashes per day. According to Bitcoin network analytics website BitInfoCharts, as of today Bitcoin’s network currently has a hashrate of 127 exahashes per day.

This seems to fall in line with what many in the crypto community are thinking. As Cointelegraph recently reported 37% of the cryptocurrency community expects Bitcoin’s hashrate to be higher one month after the block reward halving than it currently is.

A majority of Chinese miners also expect Bitmain’s Antminer S9 to be still profitable after the halving. The Antminer is the first Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit based on a 16-nanometer process chip, but is not the most efficient machine available.

RockX CEO Alex Lam — who has reportedly managed mining firms since 2013 — told Cointelegraph that because of the wet season in China, domestic mining farms could take advantage of cheap hydropower and continue operating with older and less efficient machines.

Still, Lam noted that mining farms based in the United States, Canada and Europe could phase out older machines after the halving, predicting that Bitcoin's hash rate will fall by about 30% a month after the event.

Respondents also expect the U.S. economy to influence Bitcoin in the future; 64% of them expect the quantitative easing measures undertaken by the federal reserve to have a “somewhat positive effect” on Bitcoin. Only 12% of the respondents believe the measures will have a very positive impact, while another 12% think it will have no impact.",,https://www.coindesk.com/iran-issues-license-for-nations-biggest-bitcoin-mining-operation,"iMiner, a Turkey-based company, has been granted a license to mine cryptocurrencies in Iran.

Local news source Tabnak news reported on April 28 that iMiner has the green light from the nation’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade to operate up to 6,000 mining rigs in the city of Semnan.

The mining company has so far spent 311 billion rials ($7.3 million) on setting up the biggest mining operation in the country to date.

The ministry has also allowed the firm to begin offering cryptocurrency trading and custody from within the country, as per the report.

According to iMiner’s website, the company is the “first and largest bitcoin mining and extraction system in Iran” currently with 2,000 mining machines already hosted on its local site, with additional operations in Russia, Canada, Turkey and the U.S.

It comes at a time when interest for bitcoin mining is building and low subsidized Iranian power rates attract investment from countries like China and France as well as an increasing price in bitcoin’s market value.

Up until mid-2019, the state sought to crack down on mining operations out of fear of cryptocurrency’s potential ability to undermine the national fiat currency, even threatening jail time for infractions.

However, Iran’s cabinet had a change of heart last July and introduced legislation making crypto mining an official industrial activity. Since then, the mining ministry has been actively regulating the space, reportedly issuing around 1,000 licenses to local operations in January.

The expansion of crypto mining operations can also be viewed as an attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions that have been hurting the country’s economy since long before U.S. President Donald Trump came to power.",2020-05-05 08:00:25+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-reasons-why-institutional-investors-refuse-to-join-the-crypto-sector,"For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin (BTC) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole.

Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017.

The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years?

Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold. Here are three reasons why institutional investors have yet to join the crypto market.

The on-ramp remains too steep

Investing in Bitcoin, the top listed crypto asset on CoinMarketCap, remains a significant hurdle for large mutual fund managers, especially when considering their perceived risk of Bitcoin.

Add to this the additional purchasing steps necessary, compared to more traditional assets, and the process of just buying crypto is off-putting. Some funds’ internal regulation also does not allow investments of specific products, while others are ousted by the low liquidity in regulated and approved venues.

Presence does not equal profit or guarantee a bull market

The arrival or presence of institutional investors does necessarily translate into buying pressure. Renaissance Technologies Medallion Funds’s recent entry into CME’s Bitcoin futures markets is a perfect example.

Furthermore, it should be noted that since CME futures are cash-settled, they don’t necessarily involve any Bitcoin trading activity. More importantly, a hedge fund can also open short positions.

Investors should wonder: Why should they celebrate a $10-billion fund potentially entering the space looking to bet against Bitcoin’s price?

Yes, there has been significant growth in the crypto derivatives market, and these are preferred instruments among institutional-size investors, but they remain incredibly complex for the average retail investor.

Building positions via futures might come in at a high cost, as contracts expire every two months. Furthermore, this would mean investors would take on the risk of trading at a negative premium to the spot market, as there is usually a cost involved in switching to the next expiry.

Simply put, futures contracts are not designed for long-term holding.

Compared to traditional markets, the crypto sector is too small

While Bitcoin does produce amazing returns, there are other reasons why a $94-trillion industry will not just blindly buy cryptocurrencies anytime soon.

Cryptocurrency market cap in perspective. Source: BitcoinIRA

No matter how many times one has seen the chart above, it remains pretty impressive. The crypto sector’s $248 billion market cap is just a speck among capital markets. Currently, Japanese yen banknotes in circulation amount to $1 trillion, and this does not include bank deposits nor treasuries.

The world’s 20 largest asset managers combined oversee $42.3 trillion. A mere 0.5% investment in cryptocurrencies would end up at $211 billion — equivalent to 84% of the total market cap.

Even though the past few years have shown that crypto can provide an infinite upside, one must concede cryptocurrencies are not even close to being at the same playing field as traditional markets. Grayscale Investments manages $3 billion, the largest available publicly-traded vehicle for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies.

Despite such a significant amount, it remains insignificant in the eyes of the world’s largest money managers.

Banks, credit cards, insurance and brokerage companies represent a significant portion of the portfolio for almost every large asset manager. BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, Fidelity and Wellington consistently feature as the top 20 holders of financial stocks.

Banks are a relevant player in this field as HSBC, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, UBS and Wells Fargo figure among the world’s largest mutual funds managers.

This relationship goes deeper as banks are relevant investors and distributors of such independent mutual funds. This entanglement goes even further as large financial industry players dominate equities and debt offerings, coordinating investment funds’ allocation in such deals.

There’s not much room to be gained for any mutual fund manager to sit at the wrong side of the table when the subject is the traditional finance industry.

At the moment, cryptocurrencies are in no way a threat to Visa, Wells Fargo, Chubb or Charles Schwab. It doesn’t matter how well decentralized finance is performing or how sizable Bitcoin transactions are right now.

Therefore, the question investors should be asking is: What is preventing institutions from engaging, and what would it take to get them to invest in cryptocurrencies?

Regulatory pressure remains a hurdle

Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo admitted in October 2019 that his agency deliberated with the Treasury, the United States Securities Exchange Commission and the National Economic Council to suppress Bitcoin’s incredible 2017 rally.

This government-backed plan culminated in December 2017 as CME and CBOE both listed Bitcoin futures contracts — one day after Bitcoin’s famous $19,700 top.

In May 2019, U.S. member of congress Brad Sherman called on colleagues to outlaw cryptocurrencies. President Donald Trump tweeted back in July 2019:

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

More recently, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin promised “significant new requirements” on cryptocurrencies.

In October 2019, U.S. senators went as far as sending out a letter to three companies backing Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, citing “risks the project poses to consumers, regulated financial institutions, and the global financial system.”

Despite Bitcoin not being widely regarded as a competitor to fiat money, it is almost sure that it would be if the cryptocurrency achieved a trillion-dollar market cap.

Liquidity and ease of access

BAKKT has a product designed to ease mutual funds’ significant barrier to Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin futures contracts with physical delivery allow purchases throughout an entirely regulated venue, including the custody process.

As reported by Cointelegraph, BAKKT is controlled by the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Clients willing to trade such products must do it through the regular brokers used for stocks and futures.

For ages, retail investors awaited BAKKT’s launch, as its arrival was prophesied to be a signal that the crypto sector had received the blessing of institutional investors. Estimates of a new all-time high being reached in 2018 and 2019 were relentless and more often than not, wrong.

After launch, what seemed like a perfect solution produced an average daily volume, which to this date, remains irrelevant. There are numerous reasons this could be taking place:

Few brokers currently offer BAKKT’s products.

Many funds’ internal regulations do not allow the ownership of physical Bitcoin-based investments.

Additional bureaucracy (controls) is required for funds to be approved by BAKKT.

Physical Bitcoin not accepted as margin for leverage trading.

Limited Sunday to Friday 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. trading hours.

Although internal fund regulations can be changed to accommodate Bitcoin investing, it might not make much sense right now for multi-billion-dollar investment funds.

Analysts and portfolio managers proposing the addition of a new asset class in secular mutual fund managers would be taking an immense personal risk.

Crypto can and will scale without institutions

The intention of this piece is not to turn away investors from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Pundits and analysts with no real market experience have promised impossible scenarios for far too long. If the Bitcoin market cap is still under $1 trillion, rest assured you’ve arrived early to the party, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.

There is possibly an unlimited upside for this asset class, and institutional investors’ entrance will almost certainly happen gradually, then suddenly. Right now, it is essential to realize that a multi-trillion-dollar mutual fund industry hasn’t got strong enough reasons to invest in such a nascent asset class.

Crypto does not need the mutual funds industry; it is the other way around. Bitcoin is money for regular people and an investment by itself.

Omni Layer, built on Bitcoin, has suffered negative growth in Tether transactions for the last 12 consecutive months. Tether supply on Omni Layer has also fallen more than 50% over the same period, according to Coin Metrics.

Omni Layer’s Tether supply peaked in mid-2018 at just over $3 billion. Tether tokens first launched on Omni Layer in October 2014. While fluctuations in stablecoin supply and transaction counts happen regularly, it’s unusual for there to be a contraction in supply for months at a time, especially for Tether.

Omni Layer was the only one to support Tether for over three years until the stablecoin launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum in November 2017. In less than two years, Ethereum’s share of Tether’s total circulating supply eclipsed Omni Layer’s.

Disparate Tether growth across different protocols probably is due to “current demand on each chain,” said Sean Gilligan, developer at Omni Layer. Tether can move unused tethers on Omni Layer to another chain with higher demand by issuing a simple “revoke” transaction, Gilligan explained.

'Crazy expensive' reason for the move

Performance concerns across Tether-supported protocols seem to be driving demand on platforms like Ethereum and away from Omni Layer.

“I think it mostly comes down to Ethereum being much better payment rails for something like Tether and other stablecoins,” said Anthony Sassano, adviser to mStable, a stablecoin unification protocol.

Transaction fees and confirmation times were the primary reasons Tether decided to evolve its stablecoin into a cross-chain asset supported by multiple protocols, according to Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether.

At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for.

Traders were routinely worried about sudden spikes in Bitcoin transaction fees that caused arbitrage trades to become “crazy expensive,” said Ardoino. The other concern, confirmation times, resulted from some exchanges waiting for three Bitcoin blocks to credit Omni Layer transactions, which could mean “losing the moment in the market.”

“Omni on Bitcoin provides users with multisig and a level of robustness that other chains may lack, while some chains may have lower transaction fees or faster blocks,” said Craig Sellars, co-founder of Tether and chief technologist of Omni. “It’s all about the users’ preference as to which capabilities they want to imbue their digital dollars.”

Multisignature (multisig) security means more than one digital signature is required to execute a transaction.

Ethereum currently holds the lion’s share of Tether’s supply, with nearly 3.5 billion tokens issued on Ethereum since February. Tron, a protocol similarly optimized for token issuance, holds nearly as many tokens as Omni Layer, at the time of publication.

“At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for,” said Ardoino.

“A faster, cheaper ledger with more granular levels of control is much more useful to [Tether],” said Eric Wall, chief investment officer at Arcane Assets. “USDT, by virtue of being a centralized asset, does not benefit much from Bitcoin’s expensive state-attacker-grade censorship-resistance.”

Censorship resistance to coordinated attacks from state governments is a primary feature of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. For stablecoins, however, the benefits of this high-level security may be limited.

One stablecoin for different blockchains

To date, Tether has tested eight different protocols: Omni Layer, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron, EOS, Algorand, Liquid Network and Bitcoin Cash. All of them currently support Tether except Litecoin.

In fact, Tether’s cross-chain evolution is a dominant competitive strategy for the stablecoin. Tether quickly seized on the simple growth strategy of providing each blockchain community with access to the cryptocurrency industry’s oldest and most liquid stablecoin.

“Each of these blockchains need a stablecoin in order to implement DEXes, DeFi projects and many other projects,” said Ardoino. “It’s astonishing that till today our competition did not realize that yet,” he said.

“I think that USDT will continue to be a multi-blockchain asset,” said Sassano, adding that the status quo rate of Ethereum use and development makes him think most of Tether’s supply will “live on Ethereum for the long term.”

Regardless of what the future holds for Tether’s continued growth, the Omni Layer will always consider itself to be a special place for Tether. “Omni Layer on Bitcoin is [Tether’s] home, but it has other places to go when it wants to go skiing or skydiving,” said Sellars.",2020-05-05 14:35:13+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-credit-suisse-prudential-expansion-crypto-lending-hiring,"Crypto lender BlockFi is adding two traditional finance executives to help the firm roll out new products and expand into new markets.

In early trading at 00:00 UTC, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency was in $8,800 territory before jumping as high as $9,125 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.

After that quick run-up, bitcoin quickly sold off back to $8,800 levels at 11:00 UTC (7 a.m. EDT). With 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages signaling tepid sentiment Tuesday, bitcoin is experiencing little trading action, staying at the $8,800 price range. At press time bitcoin (BTC) was trading up less than a percent over 24 hours at $8,945.

The sideways action, also known as “consolidation,” is a pattern of predictable behavior during which traders like Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research, seek various price levels in which to trade in and out.

“We are still in a consolidation phase as the next level is $14,000, I believe,” said Tan. “I think $8,400-ish should hold on the daily chart. If not, then it invalidates the bullish thesis.”

For a crypto trader to call a range between $8,400 to $14,000 is a pretty wide guess and a sign volatility could be the name of the game for the next week or two. After a brief period in which the S&P 500 was more volatile than bitcoin, the latter regained its status as the rockier asset last week, though only slightly so. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks was up less than a percent.

Bitcoin volatility rising a bit since late April is likely making it harder for traders to figure out what’s going to happen before and after the network’s once-in-four-year reward halving from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, set for approximately May 12.

Pascal Gauthier, CEO of cryptocurrency hardware wallet maker Ledger, said his company has been doing brisk sales of devices and solutions for investors to store crypto ahead of the 2020 halving. It’s something he witnessed four years ago, in July 2016, when the bitcoin reward dropped from 25 to 12.5 BTC.

“Despite external pressure on the stock market, we had our best April ever.” said Gauthier. ”The crypto market continues to climb, in a trend very similar to what we saw pre-halving in 2016.”

Despite the cryptocurrency’s reputation as a risky, volatile asset, in these unprecedented and often unpredictable times oil is actually much more volatile than either the S&P 500 or bitcoin – by a large margin.

30-day historical volatility for bitcoin, S&P 500 and oil since 4/1/20 Source: CoinDesk Research

The massive spike in oil volatility arrived in April following a historic tumble in price for a barrel of crude to as low as $2 on the open market. Oil is having another double-digit price gain Tuesday, up 12.8% and priced at $26.54 as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT). Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for online trading at investments provider IG, doesn’t expect oil’s volatility to subside anytime soon, either.

“Everyone was clearly too bearish down at $10 and lower,” Beauchamp said. “But with the price up almost three-fold from its April low, the polar opposite risk now looms. Storage constraints and oversupply problems have not disappeared, while demand is only set to recover modestly.”

Adam Pokornicky, chief operating officer at Digital Asset Investment Management (DAIM), a U.S.-registered investment advisor for digital assets, claimed that his firm almost lost a client due to the banks’ intervention.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Pokornicky described his client as a lawyer and a “high net worth individual”, adding that they’ve been acquainted for a long time. “He's both a friend and someone I've worked with over the years,” the wealth manager explained.

According to Pokornicky, his client was ready to buy a minor amount of BTC for his portfolio, but had a sudden change of heart after talking to advisors from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. “For him going from wanting to buy 1 Bitcoin to him not being interested means he was talked out of it”, said Pokornicky, whose attempts to get more context have been unsuccessful. “I still don't know what was said to him”.

Banks’ love-hate relationship with crypto

The wealth manager argued that Wall Street institutions tend to advise against crypto as per their company guidelines:

“My partner and I both worked on the buy side at a Hedge fund and/or Trading for most of our careers and we have an inordinate amount of wall street friends and colleagues that still work at big banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman, JPM, Wells Fargo, Merrill/BofA who are completely restricted from buying Bitcoin or have to go through insane compliance hoops to do it. The advisors that work for the Wealth Management divisions have a HARD NO Bitcoin policy.”

JPMorgan’s public relationship with cryptocurrencies have been complex. The bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a renowned Bitcoin naysayer who went from saying that he “doesn’t really give a shit about Bitcoin” to launching JPM Coin, a stablecoins-inspired digital asset.

Goldman Sachs has entered the industry a while ago, having invested in a number of key projects like payments application Circle and cloud-based supply chain company Tradeshift.

When asked whether he managed to pursue his client to get into Bitcoin after all, Pokornicky replied:

“No not yet. My sense is he'll come around, most likely at higher prices. They usually all do eventually.”

Big-name bitcoin investor Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital has been making the rounds this week, talking about how he views digital scarcity driving bitcoin prices higher after next week’s expected halving event. “Next Tuesday we have the bitcoin halving where the inflation rate gets cut in half,” Novogratz said on CNBC’s Closing Bell program Monday. “You talk about inflation in fiat currencies where the [Federal Reserve] is printing money like a money-printing machine and in the bitcoin space the money supply gets cut.”

This may be true, but it also means a smaller reward and thus smaller revenue for miners to pay labor, rent and electricity. That’s because they will have fewer bitcoin inflows they can sell for cash. However, in July 2016, the last time bitcoin supply was cut in half, the market was much different.

Garrick Hileman, an economist and a long-time researcher in the crypto space currently at wallet provider Blockchain.com, says things have changed since the previous halving halving event. For example, CME didn’t start offering bitcoin futures until late 2017. Ahead of this halving, bitcoin miners can purchase futures contracts, locking in bitcoin prices to pay for their expenditures.

June futures for bitcoin are priced at $9,395 on CME Wednesday, above current spot prices.

“While in theory a decreasing supply and stock-to-flow models may suggest a surge in price, the reality is a lot more complicated,” Hileman told CoinDesk. “A far larger, broader spot and derivatives market means that miner selling is simply less impactful.”

Vishal Shah, derivatives trader and founder of exchange Alpha5, says futures play a bigger role in crypto than most realize. According to Shah, due to March’s sell-off that triggered $700 million in liquidations on BitMEX, the subsequent reduction in open interest could lessen downside risk caused by post-having selling pressures.

The reduced number of leveraged open interest, which still hasn’t returned to February levels, means fewer automatic liquidations on price movements.

“If there is to be any fallout due to lower rewards, at least the leveraged open interest is not there to ‘domino’ the system lower,” Shah told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin (BTC) has once again reclaimed $9,000 with 5 days until halving.

Pantera Capital’s CEO, Dan Morehead, sees a scenario where BTC hits $115,212 by August 2021.

His analysis is based on the change in the stock-to-flow ratio across each halving.

The hype and excitement surrounding the Bitcoin halving event is once again evident in the current price of BTC. At the time of writing this, Bitcoin has just broken both the $9,000 and $9,100 resistance levels and is trading at $9,261 with 5 days until halving. A brief analysis of the BTC/USDT 6-hour chart reveals that there is renewed buying interest as we draw closer to the estimated halving date of May 12th.

Pantera Capital CEO Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Could Hit $115k After Halving

With the Bitcoin halving only days away, Pantera Capital CEO, Dan Morehead, has predicted that BTC could hit $115,212 by August of 2021. His analysis is based on the change in the stock-to-flow ratio across each halving. Mr. Morehead made this predication via twitter and further elaborated on his analysis via an informative Medium blog post. His tweet can be found below.

#bitcoin could hit $115,212 in Aug 2021 based on the change in the stock-to-flow ratio across each halving. More details here: https://t.co/fMYDXAT5qy pic.twitter.com/02uCpVoGKN — Dan Morehead (@dan_pantera) May 5, 2020

Further highlighting key points from his Medium post, Mr. Morehead explained how a reduction in supply of BTC after each halving, will impact the price of Bitcoin.

One potential framework for analyzing the impact of halvings is to study the change in the stock-to-flow ratio across each halving. The first halving reduced the supply by 15% of the total outstanding bitcoins. That’s a huge impact on supply and it had a huge impact on price. Each subsequent halving’s impact on price will likely taper off in importance as the ratio of reduction in supply from previous halvings to the next decreases.

Furthermore, his analysis went on to elaborate on the impact each halving has had on the price of Bitcoin.

The second having decreased supply only one-third as much as the first. Very interestingly, it had exactly one-third the price impact. Extrapolating this relationship to 2020: The reduction in supply is only 40% as great as in 2016. If this relationship holds, that would imply about 40% as much price impulse — bitcoin would peak at $115,212 /BTC.

What is Stock-to-Flow Ratio?

The Stock-to-flow ratio is a measure traditionally used to gauge the abundance of commodities. It is calculated by dividing the amount of a commodity held in inventories, by the amount being produced annually.

In the case of Bitcoin, it is calculated by dividing the currently known supply of Bitcoin by the BTC mined annually. At the time of writing this, there is approximately 18.365 Bitcoin already mined with an annual production of 657,000 BTC per year. This results in a Stock-to-flow ratio of 27.9.

""Bitcoin revenue generated gross profit of $7 million in the first quarter of 2020,"" the firm continued in its earnings release to investors, which was released after the market close.

Square's gross profit from bitcoin sales nearly doubled from the last quarter (~90%), based on the results. The firm reported that volumes were up 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year.

Square said in the letter that April was an especially busy month for Cash App, noting:

""In April, Cash App delivered strong revenue and gross profit growth year over year, and achieved its highest monthly totals for net-new transacting active customers, peer-to-peer volumes, Cash Card spend, Cash Card orders, direct deposit transacting active customers, bitcoin volumes, stock brokerage volumes, and stored funds.""

As The Block reported last month, Square's Cash App saw elevated bitcoin ""engagement"" amid the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent shutdowns ordered by state and local governments in the U.S.

""Adoption and engagement of fractional equity investing in Bitcoin has accelerated in recent weeks given recent market interest and volatility,"" CFO Amrita Ahuja said during an investor day call in March.

The broader market volatility driven by the global pandemic has been a boon for both brokers and exchanges alike. As The Wall Street Journal reported at the end of April, brokers have seen a surge in new accounts and trading activities as new accounts have flooded into the market.

TD Ameritrade announced that its retail clients opened a record 608,000 new funded accounts in the first quarter of 2020, with more than two-thirds of openings coming in March alone. E*Trade and Charles Schwab also reported new brokerage account records in the first quarter.

Last month, Square announced that it was adding a feature to allow users to direct those stimulus payments to their Cash App accounts with the inclusion of traditional routing and bank account numbers accessible within user Cash App accounts.

On that point, Square said in the letter:

""We also worked with our partner banks to expand direct deposit eligibility from 3 million customers in February to approximately 14 million customers ahead of the IRS’s second portal release on April 15. Our direct deposit product provides customers with a unique routing and account number that allows them to deposit their stimulus funds, tax refunds, or paychecks directly into their Cash App account. Primarily driven by the stimulus payments, Cash App achieved its highest direct deposit volume during the month of April, as volume increased approximately 3x compared to March.""

According to the latest investor letter, the growth in direct deposit usage accounted for a significant increase in the total cash balances held in customer Cash App accounts, which totaled more than $1.3 billion as of the end of April.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-crypto-boom/,"Indian Crypto Boom: Exchanges See 10X Trading Volumes During Lockdown

India’s cryptocurrency sector is booming during the extended nationwide lockdown. Several Indian cryptocurrency exchange executives have shared with news.Bitcoin.com their record-breaking stats, bullish trends, and positive sentiment despite the coronavirus-driven lockdown.

Growing Interest in Cryptocurrency in India as Lockdown Extends

India recently extended its nationwide lockdown by another fortnight due to the coronavirus outbreak. While lockdowns have crippled many economies worldwide, the Indian crypto sector is seeing significant growth in interest, trading volumes as well as the number of new users, according to several crypto exchange executives.

“I’m seeing more people wanting to spend their time under lockdown in learning and understanding what crypto is, how it works, what are the use cases of various crypto tokens etc.,” Nischal Shetty, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Wazirx, shared with news.Bitcoin.com on Monday. “People in India are more upbeat about crypto,” especially with the recent cryptocurrency price increases, he described, reiterating the positive trend he observed in April. The Wazirx CEO elaborated:

The extended lockdown has led to people showing even greater interest in crypto in India. With millions of people not having the opportunity to work due to lockdown, crypto is turning out to be an opportunity for Indians to trade and earn from it.

Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, shares the positive sentiment. “Given the crypto industry has opened up two months ago, I would say the industry is happy in spite of lockdown,” he told news.Bitcoin.com on Monday. “This situation is a lot better than the one we faced due to regulatory confusion for two years.”

Zebpay chief marketing officer Vikram Rangala sees a similar trend at his exchange. “The extended lockdown has not hurt Zebpay’s business,” he told news.Bitcoin.com. “More likely, being at home gives people time to download our ebooks, learn about crypto, and decide to join Zebpay.” He continued: “We decided to start working remotely even before the lockdown and were already working on work-from-home flexibility, so we were able to adapt quickly … We’ve also been hiring new people at the same rate we would have without the lockdown.”

Crypto Exchanges Hit Record-Breaking Volumes

All three crypto exchange executives are seeing record-breaking volumes on their trading platforms. “Our trading volume has been increasing rapidly week over week,” Wazirx’s CEO confirmed. “In fact, this week we recorded one of our highest daily trading volume of over $10M.” He additionally revealed, “Our user signups have also shot up tremendously. We also hit an ATH for our weekly active users number last week,” adding:

Our trading volume before the lockdown in India used to be around $1M. It has grown over 10X in just 60 days.

Sharing the positive sentiment, Zebpay’s CMO said: “just last week we had another record volume (since our January relaunch) day. New registrations and KYCs are also doing well. We’ve added staff and automations to handle the KYC load and new deposits. Other Indian firms also seem to be active and doing well.” He opined: “One thing is clear from everything we’ve seen: India’s crypto winter only increased people’s interest in sound digital assets and new ways to take control of their wealth. That’s not going away.”

There are also other factors that could have resulted in increased interest in cryptocurrency as well as trading volumes in India. Unocoin’s CEO pointed out that “both the pandemic and the regulatory clarity happened at the same time in India.” It was only in March that the Supreme Court of India quashed the banking restriction that the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), imposed on the crypto industry in its April 2018 circular. During the court hearing, it was also reiterated that cryptocurrency is legal in India. Following the supreme court ruling, crypto exchanges began bringing back INR support. Vishwanath confirmed that on his exchange:

The present volumes are definitely 10X than before these two events.

He concluded that the only question now would be “would we have done better with just regulatory clarity but not the pandemic and I think it might have been marginally better. Only time will tell.”

Ukraine's acting energy minister Olha Buslavets has sent a letter to Energoatom, the country’s state-owned operator of nuclear power plants, to consider using excess electricity for mining cryptocurrencies.

“To work out, together with Energoatom and the Energoatom Trading division, the regulatory and technical issues of the possible implementation of cryptocurrency mining projects in order to provide additional markets for the electricity generated by nuclear power plants,” the letter reads, which was published by Geo Leros, a Member of Parliament (Servant of the People Party faction), on his Facebook account.

Energoatom has until May 8 to explore potential ways to mine cryptocurrencies, per the letter.

‘Fundamentally new economy’

In a separate post on its Facebook account, Ukraine's energy ministry today said nuclear power plants in the country have had excess electricity due to the effects of the coronavirus lockdown.

The ministry went on to say that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s vision is to digitize Ukraine and applying innovative solutions to avoid wasting electricity is the best way forward.

“One of the modern approaches for using excess electricity is to devote it to cryptocurrency mining. That would not only allow to maintain the guaranteed load on the nuclear power plants, but also ensure that companies can attract extra funds. Therefore, it would open the way to a fundamentally new economy, new approaches, a new market model,” said the ministry.

Ukraine has been optimistic about the crypto mining sector. Earlier this year, the country's Ministry of Digital Transformation said it won't regulate the industry because it is already self-governed by blockchain consensus rules.

“We remain loyal to mining activities that form part of open decentralized networks. Mining does not require regulatory activity from governmental oversight bodies or other third-party regulations, this activity is regulated by the protocol itself and network members,"" the digital transformation ministry said at the time.

It remains to be seen whether Energoatom goes ahead with Buslavets’s proposal.

Announced Wednesday, the spot and derivatives marketplace joins a select group of well-known cryptocurrency firms including Coinbase, Robinhood and Bitstamp as well as crypto brokerage Tagomi that have all met the required NYFDS standards for the so-called BitLicense.

“We are pleased that the New York Department of Financial Services recognized our commitment to the high standards we borrowed from existing capital markets structures and applied them to the cryptocurrency space,” said Thomas Chippas, CEO of ErisX, in a press release.

In 2019, ErisX was also awarded a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its futures market and clearinghouse. As a result, ErisX entities are licensed to operate in 47 states and jurisdictions, including New York.

Formally launched in June 2015, the BitLicense was designed by the NYDFS to provide a framework for companies looking to services relating to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as trading or custody.

The NYFDS requires any businesses conducting cryptocurrency transactions with New York residents to be licensed to operate within the state even if the companies are based elsewhere.

Towards the end of 2019, the BitLicense came under review from NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell, who said it was “good to take a close look” at the platforms operating in the emerging cryptocurrency industry and to reflect the changes to the space since 2015.

“DFS continues its commitment to fostering financial innovation in New York,” said Lacewell. “Today’s approval is another step in expanding virtual currency activities in the state and promoting New York’s support for financial innovation, which will be especially important as we work to reopen the economy of the world’s financial capital.”

Discussing the news, Chippas told CoinDesk: “Our work with regulators is always open and transparent, which allows us to build innovative products and services while still operating a compliant and safe business.”",2020-05-06 15:02:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/amun-launches-token-tracking-the-inverse-of-bitcoins-price,"A new token lets traders make gains whenever bitcoin’s price falls.

Swiss fintech firm Amun launched its BTCSHORT (BTCS) daily inverse token Wednesday, which returns gains based on inverse price movements of bitcoin (BTC) in a given 24-hour period. The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January and now overseen by sister firm 21Shares following a March rebranding.

“Typically, these purchases are short term in nature, usually on a daily basis, as the holder aims to move in quickly to leverage a near-term decline in bitcoin to make a positive return,” the firm said in an announcement.

Designed as a stablecoin, BTCS is built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, meaning it’s as easy to purchase as any other token and will be available on secondary markets beginning with Liquid, HitBTC and Bitcoin.com, Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun and 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an interview.

“Demand for these leverage and inverse tokens is tremendous,” Rashwan said. “The users want the ability to buy these kinds of products in an easier and safer way.”

Rashwan said BTCS was purpose-built for traders of all stripes: retail to institutional. Moreover, the token was released before the May 11 bitcoin halving in order for traders to hedge against potential volatility, Amun said.

The token was designed under the practices and standards developed by 21Shares, Rashwan said. The firm currently lists 11 ETPs on multiple European stock exchanges including the SIX Swiss.

For compliance reasons, minting and burning BTCS is conducted on the Amun platform in exchange for the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC and remains off-limits to U.S. and Swiss investors, along with internationally sanctioned nations.

Rashwan said Amun will roll out similar inverse tokens, including one for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ether (ETH), in the coming weeks.

Simplicity sells

With BTCS, the firm is primarily catering to the risk-averse side of the crypto market, investors who would rather trade regulation-compliant products, Rashwan said.

“Regulations are important and it is just astounding to me how that’s now a contrarian opinion,” he said.

Alternative derivatives markets such as BitMEX, Binance and FTX often stand on the other side of the moat. For example, BitMEX and FTX operate out of the lightly regulated Seychelles and Antigua and Barbuda, respectively, while Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao frequently reminds his Twitter followers of his firm’s decentralized work environment and is somewhat hazy on where the company is based.

Either way, new products are chasing the money flowing into crypto derivatives platforms, which Rashwan said would likely overtake spot cryptocurrency trading in the near future.

One new product that perhaps best highlights this innovation would be FTX’s (i)BVOL financial instrument, which made its debut late last month.

(i)BVOL comes in both a long and an inverse form – hence the (i) – and generally “tracks market implied volatility,” FTX and Alameda Research CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in an email.

Like the BTCS token, the (i)BVOL token is built on the ERC-20 standard and a separate in-house contract called MOVE that gives “traders the ability to buy and sell bitcoin volatility over different time periods on margin,” Bankman-Fried said.

Notably, these tokens free traders from margin maintenance, known to be a sticky issue in crypto derivatives trading.

FTX and Amun’s tokens perhaps suggest ERC-20-based, wrapped derivatives are a good solution for retail users who can struggle with complex derivatives products.

Rashwan pointed to the March delisting of a different set of FTX tokens from Binance’s derivatives platform as a salient example for Amun. As CoinDesk reported, Binance’s CZ removed the BULL and BEAR leverage tokens from his platform, arguing that “users don’t understand” the products and were therefore taking unrealized losses.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report found that bitcoin is still king in those circles.

As first reported by Forbes, the Electric Coin Company – the company behind Zcash – commissioned the study, which was released on May 6. Zcash ""has only a minor presence on the dark web,"" according to the think tank, ""indicating that Zcash is seen as a less attractive option to dark web users and is used less often compared to other cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Monero.""

Specifically, Rand looked at three areas: money laundering, terrorism financing and illicit goods trade, of which Zcash seemingly plays a small role compared to more-widely used cryptocurrencies in this context.

""While there are certainly some indications or anecdotal evidence that Zcash may have been used or advertised for illicit purposes, there is no evidence of widespread illicit use of Zcash. Of course, absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence, meaning that enduring vigilance against malicious use of this cryptocurrency is nonetheless important,"" the report noted.

""We didn't find any significant evidence that the zcash was used for illicit activities, but also as we know, that doesn't mean that zcash isn't at all used for illicit activity,"" Rand Europe analyst Erik Silfversten was quoted as saying by Forbes. ""We have to look at technology as a neutral, that it could be used for a wide variety of applications, and then we have to look at the actual evidence.""

The findings echo those published last October by The Block Research, which found bitcoin, monero, and litecoin are the most-frequently-used cryptocurrencies by dark web marketplaces.

The cryptocurrency has moved largely in tandem with the stock markets over the past two months. Prices fell from $10,000 to $3,867 in the first two weeks of March because the coronavirus-led sell-off in global equities triggered a global dash for cash. The cryptocurrency rose back above $7,000 in the following four weeks, tracking the recovery in stocks.

The positive correlation, however, weakened last week with bitcoin posting double-digit gains despite moderate losses in equities. The cryptocurrency is now trading near $9,300, representing a 4.4% gain on a week-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The crypto market’s focus seems to have shifted away from the coronavirus to the reward halving, expected to take effect on May 12 (though it may happen sooner). The supply-altering process has been hailed as a price-bullish event by many analysts for over a year now, and the recent rally from $7,600 to $9,400 may have been fueled by a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the expected gains.

Bitcoin’s network is also experiencing its busiest period in over two years. For instance, the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses active on the network jumped to 947,088 on Wednesday to hit the highest level since January 2018, according to the data from Glassnode. The spike suggests increased investor interest in the cryptocurrency, as noted earlier this week.

Further, the cryptocurrency’s hash rate – the computing power dedicated to mining blocks – recently rose to an all-time high of 140 exahashes per second.

Most observers expect bitcoin’s price to rise into five figures ahead of the halving. From a technical analysis standpoint, the case for a rally to $10,000 would strengthen following an acceptance above a major resistance level.

Bitcoin is currently trading just above the resistance of the trendline connecting the July 2019 and February 2020 highs (currently at $9,280). If prices hold above that level for a few more hours, stronger chart-driven buying will likely emerge, lifting prices toward $10,000.

However, bitcoin has failed a couple of times in the last six days to keep gains above the long-term trendline hurdle.

Put options in demand

While the cryptocurrency is gaining altitude, investors seem to be buying put options (bearish bets, in effect), possibly to hedge against a potential post-halving price drop. This is evident from the rise in the one-month put-call skew from -3% on May 1 to 9.1% on Wednesday.

Bulls have firm control over Bitcoin’s price action. Indicators show BTC’s trend is expected to continue towards $10,500.

Bitcoin Is Breaking Loose

Bitcoin began surging over the last few hours to hit a high of $9,800 despite bearish market conditions. The upswing allowed it to demolish the massive supply wall that was at $9,600.

Here, IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model estimated that more than 1.2 million addresses were holding over 930,000 BTC.

Now that the flagship cryptocurrency sliced through resistance, there is only one way to go—up.

If the buying pressure behind the bellwether cryptocurrency continues rising, the next barriers to watch out for are the mid-Feb. high and the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level. These hurdle points sit at $10,500 and $10,900, respectively.

Nonetheless, it is important to remember that the erratic behavior seen recently could be part of a setup. Large holders could be pumping Bitcoin before the halving to then dump their holdings on unaware investors.

Will Whales Dump their BTC?

There has been a noticeable change in the way large holders with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have been behaving. These big players were slowly decreasing their positions, but over the last few days, they started accumulating. The sudden change could signal that market makers are indeed preparing to dump at the top, according to Santiment.

The crypto data insights platform affirmed that a similar behavior appears to be happening with idled coins, which are all of a sudden on the move. The purpose behind it may be “to sell to the newcomers.” Those who get involved in the “halvening rally” might find themselves purchasing BTC from the big whales.

This type of market manipulation strategy has been seen in previous halvings. Therefore, those who panic buy must remain cautious that prices don’t reverse against them.

The $9,440 support level now has a lot of significance to Bitcoin’s rise. This support barrier must rebuff a drop to maintain the continuity of the trend. Otherwise, it would be very likely that the flagship cryptocurrency will reverse and liquidate those who were late to the party.

If this were to happen, the next important support level sits around $8,300.",2020-05-07 21:33:42+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/paul-tudor-jones-reportedly-buys-bitcoin-as-an-inflation-hedge-compares-crypto-to-70s-gold-trade.html,"Legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones is reportedly buying bitcoin as an inflation hedge as central banks around the globe print money to relieve coronavirus-battered economies.

Jones, one of Wall Street's most-successful and seasoned hedge fund managers, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. He compared it to the gold trade in the 1970s, according to the report.

Bitcoin futures trading on the CME jumped 5% on Thursday.

Jones, founder and chief executive at Tudor Investment Corp., told CNBC in March that he thought the stock market could be higher by June if coronavirus cases began to peak. The investor said at the time that he expected stocks to endure a choppy April but that, ultimately, equities would again climb.

""I do think the stock market's going to find a bottom once we get a peak in the epidemic curve, [there's] not a doubt in my mind the stock market will rally,"" he said on March 26. ""My guess is we'll be higher three or four months from now, five months from now, than lower than where we are right now.""

His comments were of particular importance at the time given the historic market sell-off just days earlier that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each sink more than 25% each from their respective all-time highs.

He stressed in March that — as both part of his market thesis and as a matter of public wellbeing — the novel coronavirus, as deadly as it is, shouldn't be sensationalized into an unbeatable plague.

""We've got to be careful not to mythologize this particular disease,"" he said at the time. ""We've got to be careful not to mythologize this into the pandemic Godzilla. We can beat this thing.""

His comments in the reported memo come as central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, embark on unprecedented monetary policy initiatives designed to help businesses keep the lights on during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fed has already enacted two emergency interest rate cuts that lowered borrowing costs to near zero like they were during the financial crisis.

But it's also promised to introduce 10 separate programs designed to ensure market liquidity and issue loans to businesses and consumers in need. That's in addition to the open-ended program of buying U.S. debt and mortgage-backed securities.

It's those types of policies, which involve the Fed essentially printing money and injecting it into the U.S. economy, that have some investors worried that prices could zoom higher in the future.

Jones’ Tudor BVI Global Fund, managed by Tudor Investment Corp., has been authorized to hold as much as “a low single-digit percentage exposure percentage” of its assets in bitcoin futures, according to a note sent to investors this month. The firm manages $38 billion, of which $22 billion is in the flagship BVI fund. Bloomberg News reported the disclosure earlier Thursday.

It is not clear from the letter whether Tudor’s fund has begun buying futures, what kind (physically delivered or cash-settled), on which exchange it would do so or whether it plans to also trade the underlying commodity. Reached by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Tudor had no immediate comment.

Jones was one of the first well-known hedge fund managers, having started Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 at the age of 25. He made a name – and a substantial return — for himself by correctly calling the 1987 crash and then shorting Japanese equities a couple of years later just before that market collapsed.

He has since become an elder statesmen of sorts for the hedge fund world and his philanthropic endeavor, the Robin Hood Foundation, boasts finance titans and celebrities on its board.

Bitcoin reminds Jones of gold in the 1970s, according to the letter. Through the early 1970s, gold experienced an acute rally from $35 per ounce in 1971 to a peak of $180 in late 1974.

Unprecedented central bank monetary policy amid the coronavirus crisis is a primary reason for Jones’ interest in bitcoin. What he referred to as the ongoing “Great Monetary Inflation” left him, a market veteran, speechless. It’s an “unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen,” Jones wrote to his clients.

Jones’ statement comes amid a new all-time high in CME bitcoin futures open interest, which nearly reached $400 million on Wednesday, according to Skew. Bitcoin also rallied nearly 10% on Thursday, climbing from $9,000 to just below $9,900 at the time of publication.

A low-single-digit percentage of the Tudor BVI fund’s assets would be equivalent to nearly all open interest in CME bitcoin futures contracts at the time of publication.

Amid much discussion on monetary policy in his letter, Jones inserted a subjective ranking of certain assets by their ability to store value, based on a poll of his research group. With 100 as the maximum and best score, Jones’ team ranked Bitcoin at 43, the worst score relative to gold, cash, and financial assets.

“What was surprising to me was not that Bitcoin came in last, but that it scored as high as it did,” he wrote. Its score, as a proportion of the other categories, was higher than the cryptocurrency’s market cap as a proportion of the others. “Something appears wrong here and my guess is it is the price of Bitcoin.”",2020-05-07 18:41:52+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161146-bitcoin-btc-remains-a-widely-used-cryptocurrency-for-dark-web-transactions-a-new-report-claims/,"A recent report from Rand (Research And Development) Corporation, an American non-profit global policy think tank that’s funded by the US government (and private endowment corporations, universities, and private individuals), claims that Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, is being used to carry out a relatively large number of dark web transactions.

Rand Corporation’s study looked into the use of privacy-oriented digital currencies, such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), to facilitate dark web transactions.

The Electric Coin Company, the firm behind the development of Zcash, had commissioned the research study, which was published on May 6, 2020.

The report says that Zcash has “only a minor presence on the dark web,” which suggests that it may have been “seen as a less attractive option to dark web users and is used less often compared to other cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Monero.”

The report acknowledges that there may be some “indications or anecdotal evidence” that Zcash could have been used or promoted for use in illicit activities.

However, the report claims there is “no evidence of widespread illicit use of Zcash.” It goes on to clarify:

“[The] absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence … enduring vigilance against malicious use of this cryptocurrency is nonetheless important.”

Erik Silfversten, an analyst at Rand Europe, says that there wasn’t any “significant” evidence that the Zcash had been used to carry out illicit transactions, however, he admitted that it doesn’t mean that the cryptocurrency isn’t used for illegal activity at all.

Silfversten added:

“We have to look at technology as a neutral, that it could be used for a wide variety of applications, and then we have to look at the actual evidence.”

In January 2020, Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analytics and cybersecurity firm, reported that it traced $2.8 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) being transferred to criminals via cryptocurrency exchanges in 2019. The company claims that most of these transactions went through Binance and Huobi, two of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms.

Chainalysis’ management noted:",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-lawsuit-idUSKBN22J32V,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. cryptocurrency investor on Thursday sued a suburban New York high school senior, accusing the 18-year-old of being the mastermind and ringleader of a cybercrime scheme that defrauded him out of millions of dollars in digital currencies.

The plaintiff, Michael Terpin, accused Ellis Pinsky, of Irvington, New York, and his alleged co-conspirators of stealing $23.8 million of cryptocurrency in January 2018, when the defendant was 15, and is seeking triple damages of $71.4 million.

“On the surface, Pinsky is an ‘All American Boy,’” Terpin said in a complaint filed in federal court in White Plains, New York. “The tables are now turned.”

Pinsky could not immediately be reached for comment. Calls to a phone number for him obtained through court records and a public records search were not answered. It was unclear whether Pinsky has a lawyer.

Cryptocurrency crime is a growing problem, with losses soaring to $4.52 billion last year from $1.74 billion in 2018, according to cybersecurity company CipherTrace.

In his complaint, Terpin said Pinsky and his “gang of digital bandits” would steal from victims after gaining control of their smartphones through “SIM swaps,” and that Pinsky bragged to friends that he would never get caught.

Terpin accused Pinsky and his alleged co-conspirators, none identified by name in the complaint, of violating federal laws against racketeering and computer fraud.

Terpin in May 2019 won a $75.8 million civil judgment in a related case in a California state court against Nicholas Truglia, an alleged Pinsky associate who has faced criminal hacking charges in California and New York.

Terpin said the New York charges relate to the $23.8 million theft. Terpin is also suing his carrier AT&T Mobility in Los Angeles for $240 million, court records show. A judge is considering AT&T’s bid to dismiss that case, the records show.

SIM swapping occurs when a hacker tricks a mobile phone carrier into transferring a target’s phone number from a registered SIM card, the small plastic chip connecting a phone to a cellular network, to a SIM card he or she possesses. This can be done with help from someone at the carrier, or by stating information about the target obtained from social media and other accounts.",2020-05-07 18:49:09+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/one-of-bitcoins-earliest-miners-is-dedicating-66m-in-crypto-to-a-fund-of-funds,"Bixin, one of the earliest bitcoin miner operators and wallet startups, is dedicating 6,600 bitcoin, worth $66 million, to a new fund of funds.

The company announced the fund of funds with its proprietary capital on Friday, and said it aims to invest in global quantitative trading funds whose strategies are based on arbitrage, bitcoin futures contracts and trend analysis.

By providing additional liquidity and market-making activities to these trading desks amid bitcoin’s scheduled halving event, Bixin seeks to increase its holdings in bitcoin as part of its “unwavering commitment to bitcoin,” the firm said in the announcement.

At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up less than 1 percent over 24 hours at $9,966 and above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, bullish technical indicators. The cryptocurrency has spent much of its U.S. trading hours with a $9,900 handle on spot exchanges like Coinbase, a small retreat after briefly breaking above the $10,000 barrier Thursday.

“Most of the people I know are buying bitcoin and gold as a hedge against global recession. Most likely this trend will continue to grow strong,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital.

A boost above the $10,000 price level is certainly a big draw if you are interested in bitcoin. What’s more, conversations about the bitcoin reward halving, expected Monday, May 11, have increased in the past week. Kogan believes bitcoin prices can push up to as much as $12,000 before the halving, an every-four-years event that this time will lower bitcoin’s generation of new cryptocurrency from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.

Additionally, investor Paul Tudor Jones II, who manages $38 billion in assets, published an outlook and change to one of his fund’s strategies to reflect trading in bitcoin futures on Thursday.

“Paul Tudor Jones has written quite a knowledgeable piece on bitcoin. Adoption on Wall Street-fueled halving-FOMO is my bet,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader.

“It’s clearly lots of casual investors coming in and picking it up. I’m even getting friends and contacts asking me again,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.

However, in his note, Jones revealed his fund’s strategy is around bitcoin derivatives, likely on advanced futures platforms like CME, not purchasing spot bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase. “We have set the initial maximum exposure guideline for purchasing bitcoin futures to a low single digit exposure percentage,” Jones wrote in his outlook titled “The Great Monetary Inflation.”

Indeed, derivatives such as futures are seeing an uptick, and Swissquote’s Thomas expects an interesting dynamic in the coming weeks. As more investors have conversations on bitcoin’s place in an uncertain global economy, professional traders active in the crypto derivatives market are hedging their bets with both futures and options.

The crypto options market is experiencing record highs – over $1 billion – but there are more bearish bets in the form of put options than bullish calls. “Looking at bitcoin options we can see that puts are more expensive than calls,” said Thomas. “This implies that more people are picking up downside protection.”

“New money is driving us higher ahead of the halving and professionals will push us lower afterwards,” he added. “Medium term, still very much bullish, just short term we’re in for a rough ride.”

The Crypto Valley experts came to a consensus that this Bitcoin block reward halving would be different from the previous two, regardless of which direction the price of Bitcoin (BTC) goes.

Shifting focus on Bitcoin’s value proposition

The experts agreed that the macroeconomics’ environment is changing. More and more people are considering storing their life savings in Bitcoin as a hedge against the current troubled monetary system.

The power has also started to shift from miners to the community and traders, according to Arnaud Salomon, CEO of Mt Pelerin. He explained:

The power has shifted away from miners. They’re not in the same position as they used to be ten years ago or even five years ago [...]. The stock is already so big and because today there is a lot of Bitcoin in circulation people are willing to trade and exchange.

Event moderator Alexandre Juncker and author of “Blockchain Quarterly” said the halving highlights Bitcoin’s monetary mission to oppose arbitrary monetary policies conducted by central banks. He noted:

We witness the very moment when a vast economic crisis triggered by a pandemic is threatening to overwhelm already over-indebted States. In the turmoil to come, the value-proposition of debased unstoppable pure Bitcoin whose money supply is written in code is likely to meet popular adoption flying away from fiat hyperinflation in many countries.

Additionally, Bitcoin adds discipline rather than competes with the existing financial system, according to Yves Longchamp, head of research at Seba bank. He stressed that BTC offers an alternative, which people can voluntarily use for storing value in something that is not correlated with other financial assets.

“Forget about price prediction”

Finally, professor Fabian Schar from University of Basel closed his presentation during the panel discussion with his own view on the halving, saying:",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/stimulus-checked-heres-the-roi-on-a-1200-investment-in-top-crypto-assets/,"To soften the critical blow dealt by the coronavirus to the United States economy, the government issued stimulus checks on last month, and according to data, much of these stimulus checks made their way into Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

The boost in economic activity and spare cash may be partly responsible for the recent bullish price action, in addition to Bitcoin’s halving restoring interest to the space. Here’s what a $1,200 investment made with a stimulus check would have resulted in for ROI across top crypto assets.

Bitcoin Gets Boost From Stimulus Checks Coinciding With Supply Reduction

Markets reached local highs and even all-time highs across the stock market at the start of the year and into February 2020. But that’s about when the world truly learned of the impact the coronavirus would soon have.

Fear spread across the crypto market, causing a historic selloff now referred to as Black Thursday. Bitcoin crashed by over 60%, and the stock market set a record for the worst quarterly close ever recorded in the days following.

The only positive thing to come out of the pandemic – depending on your perspective – was stimulus checks.

Stimulus relief packages approved by Congress and the President started hitting bank accounts starting on Saturday, April 11, according to the IRS. As soon as these funds started hitting accounts, those that didn’t need to rely on it to cover bills or replace lost income suddenly found themselves with spare cash.

This spare cash made its way into Bitcoin, as was pointed out by a spike in BTC buy orders in the amount of $1,200 – the highest stimulus check awarded depending on income level.

The boost to the first-ever crypto asset could be partly responsible for the recent push to $10,000 that occurred this week.

Those who invested their $1,200 into BTC would now have $1,740 in USD equivalent.

Other Crypto Assets Bring Positive ROI for Relief Money Investors

Investing elsewhere in the crypto market would have provided similar results. Next in line, is Ethereum up by 34%. This would take the $1,200 stimulus check value and turned it into $1,608,

The lagging third-ranked crypto, XRP, is up 17%, turning that $1,200 into $1,404. Chainlink has set similar gains and ROI on that initial $1,200 invested. Tezos, another altcoin rockstar, is up 40% taking that investment to as high as $1,680.

Bitcoin, however, topped the list. This is likely due to more interest surrounding the asset’s halving. The event is just days away and will lower the BTC supply miners receive.

A rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors. Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around $9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than 6.4% rise from the day before. The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around 1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by bitcoin which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood at $268.07 billion.

Industry participants said that a number of factors — from supportive central bank monetary policy to increased interest from institutional investors — has factored into the bitcoin rally. Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the price has rallied over 150%. Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. ""Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,"" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. ""Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what."" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.

The 'halving'

Part of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as ""halving."" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a ""decentralized"" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever ""wins"" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This ""mining"" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.

""For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. ""This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.""

Institutional buying?

Dibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. ""The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin—publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,"" Dibb said. ""With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets."" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.

Flashbacks to 2017?",2020-05-08 00:00:00,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin-trading-cryptocurrency-2020-highs,"Bitcoin has catalysts and now investors want to know if it can maintain momentum. The cryptocurrency is working on eight straight weeks of gains.

Bitcoin has been resurgent lately, climbing roughly 12% so far this week.

The move adds to last week’s 16.3% jump, while bitcoin prices have risen for eight straight weeks.

The cryptocurrency bottomed in early March, a few weeks ahead of the stock market, giving investors a hint that perhaps bitcoin had fallen too far, too fast. Indeed, the assets has been surging over the past two months, now up about 150%.

The rally comes ahead of next week’s halving, which was described earlier on TheStreet:

“In its simplest form, bitcoin halving reduces the amount of tokens miners - the data-hogging computer programmers that validate new transactions and add to the ever-increasing blockchain -- receive for each new 'win' from 12.5 to 6.25 on May 12.”

Bitcoin caught a big boost earlier this week on comments from legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones. He argued that bitcoin looks like gold in the 1970s and he sees it being a reasonable hedge against inflation.

Jones said, “the best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse ... if I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be bitcoin.""

As of this writing, bitcoin prices are hovering just below $10,000 per share. The last few times bitcoin went through a halving, shares ultimately gained in response. With one of Wall Street’s most well-known traders involved, can the cryptocurrency maintain momentum?

Aside from the psychological significance, a move over $10,000 could trigger a larger rally up toward the 2020 highs near $10,500. At this point, this area seems like a magnet for the bulls.

To get there, bitcoin will face the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range at $10,136. Above $10,500 could put the 78.6% retracement in play at $11,804.

Should bitcoin prices retreat rather than break out, look for support to come into play near the 10-day moving average. Below that mark and the $8,000 area should be significant support. There, bitcoin will find its 100-day and 200-day moving averages.

Just keep in mind, this is a very volatile asset, and big moves can be expected in both directions. While bitcoin may need a break after eight straight weeks of gains, new 2020 highs can’t be ruled out.",2020-05-08 18:05:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/open-positions-on-bitcoin-options-pass-1b-for-first-time,"Open contracts on bitcoin options rose to record highs on Thursday as the cryptocurrency’s price rose into five figures.

Data from major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, and CME – shows that open interest on options rose above $1 billion, surpassing the previous all-time high of $970 million registered on Feb. 14, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

The metric has increased sharply from the low of $410 million observed in March when the bitcoin market crashed on “Black Thursday,” March 12.

Deribit, the world’s biggest crypto options exchange by volume, contributed nearly 90% of the total on Thursday as open positions on the Panama-based exchange reached a record high of $903 million.

Global options trading volume also jumped to $213.7 million yesterday, the highest level since the March 12 crash, while bitcoin itself clocked a two-month high of $10,062 on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price index. At press time, bitcoin had dropped back to near $9,830, representing a 1.5% drop on the day, but an over 10% gain on a week-to-date basis.

Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy, while the put option gives the buyer the right to sell.

Open interest refers to the number of options contracts that have

been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or

assignment. While open interest represents the number of contracts open at a

given point of time, trading volume refers to the number of contracts traded

during a specific period.

The surge in open interest looks to have been caused by increased demand for put options, or bearish bets.

“Post-March crash, put options have been bought for downside protection primarily. As the market has rallied, more interest has entered via increased put accumulation,” said Tony Stewart, a derivatives trader and analyst in Deribit’s Market Insights channel.

Validating Stewart’s argument is the one-month put-call skew’s recent rise from -3% to 9.1%. The positive figure indicates that put options are costlier due to drawing greater demand than calls. Similar sentiments are being echoed by the put-call ratio, which rose to a 10-month high of 0.81 on Monday, according to Skew data.

The put bias seen in the options market suggests investors may be hedging for a potential post-halving price drop. Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving on Tuesday, following which the reward per block mined will drop to 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

That the supply-altering event is a long-term bullish development has been extensively discussed by the analyst community for many months. Bitcoin’s price has rallied by nearly 160% since bottoming out at $3,867 in March and has recently decoupled from traditional markets as hype over the event mounts.

Such strong rallies ahead of major events are often followed by price pullbacks. Historical data shows the cryptocurrency suffered a 30% drop in the four weeks following its second reward halving, which took place on July 9, 2016.

“We may see the market drop by 25%-35% from the peak, but we expect it to be followed by a period of range-bound trading over a number of months and then a gradual move back up. The longer-term horizon for bitcoin is extremely bullish but in the short-to-medium term, we think we’ll see a lot of disappointed players out there,” said Ed Hindi, CIO of Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP, which focuses on liquidity provision and arbitrage within the cryptocurrency markets.

Hence, it’s not surprising that trades are buying hedges (puts)

against long positions in the spot or futures market.

Bitcoin is widely expected to remain bid over the weekend due to “FOMO” buying from retail investors. FOMO, or fear of missing out, refers to panic buying in a rising market.

Until the halving has passed, more price rises look likely. “$10,000 has already been breached and the psychological resistance of that has been overcome. We are keeping our eye on $10,500 as the next key level,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Michael Terpin claims his phone was hacked and his money stolen in 2018 by a ring led by Westchester County, New York, teen Ellis Pinksy as part of a “sophisticated cybercrime spree.” Terpin, the founder and chief executive officer of blockchain advisory firm Transform Group, is suing Pinsky, now 18, for $71 million under a federal racketeering law that allows for triple damages.

A 15-year-old hacker and his crew of “evil computer geniuses” stole nearly $24 million in cryptocurrency from an adviser to blockchain companies, according to a lawsuit filed in New York.

Pinsky, of Irvington, New York, couldn’t be reached for comment. John Siffert, a lawyer who has previously represented Pinsky, didn’t immediately respond to email and phone message.

According to Terpin. Pinsky’s ring identifies people with large cryptocurrency holdings and gains control of their phones by bribing or fooling employees of their wireless carriers. The hackers are then able to intercept authentication messages, gain information and drain the victims’ cryptocurrency accounts.

Pinsky has boasted to friends that, starting at age 13, he stole more than $100 million worth of cryptocurrency, hundreds of thousands of dollars of which has been converted into cash stored in his bedroom, the lawsuit alleges. Terpin also claims that, after confronting Pinsky about his alleged role in the theft, the teenager sent him cryptocurrency, cash and a watch with a combined value $2 million. He claims this was an admission by Pinsky that he had stolen from Terpin.

Terpin said Pinsky was helped by Nicholas Truglia, who was charged criminally in the theft in New York in December and faces unrelated charges in California. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. Terpin won a $75.8 million default judgment against Truglia last year in California state court. Truglia’s lawyer declined to comment.

Terpin sued AT&T in 2018, claiming it was the wireless carrier’s lax security that allowed Pinsky’s group to gain control of his phone. The company has denied the allegation.

Announcing the news on Friday, the firm said it is looking to raise at least CHF 46 million (~$47.5 million) to push its total capital to CHF 100 million (~$103 million).

Around CHF 20 million (~$20.6 million) has already been ""committed"" by “friends & family,” led by Swiss banker Roger Studer and the Studer Family Office. Studer was head of investment banking at Vontobel and is now chairman of the board of directors of the family office.

Studer believes Bitcoin Suisse is “poised to grow rapidly” given its “proven and solid business.” The firm currently provides prime brokerage, custody, lending, staking, and tokenization services to institutional and corporate clients.

Bitcoin Suisse is also undergoing licensing as a Swiss bank since October 2019.

“As Bitcoin Suisse transitions into becoming a Swiss bank, company equity solidly above CHF 100m will provide a strong and profitable balance sheet,” said CEO Arthur Vayloyan. “The Series A round opens the way to greatly accelerate and grow the business volume of Bitcoin Suisse, as well as its profitability.”

The firm is offering up to 20% of shares on a group level - in BTCS Holding AG - the holding company owning and controlling all Bitcoin Suisse subsidiaries. Subscription starts from May 11 and will end around mid-June 2020. The minimum subscription per investor is CHF 250,000 (~$257,000).

‘Unicorn by 2025’

Founded in 2013, Bitcoin Suisse aims to grow into a unicorn (a valuation of $1 billion) by 2025. The firm plans to convert its Liechtenstein operations into a fully operational bank.

In 2021, Bitcoin Suisse also plans to conduct a security token offering (STO), and then an initial public offering (IPO) in 2022/ 2023.

The firm's monthly average revenue in Q1 2020 was CHF 1.8 million (~$1.85 million), as compared to CHF 1.7 million (~$1.75 million) monthly average revenue in 2019.



There are currently over 140 people working for Bitcoin Suisse across its offices in Switzerland, Denmark and Liechtenstein.

This news was made available as part of an effort to drive crypto adoption in the hyperinflation-stricken country.

Earlier today, Panama-based cryptocurrency merchant-gateway startup Cryptobuyer announced a partnership with Venezuelan company Mega Soft, which processes payments for thousands of local businesses via its platform called “Merchant Server.”

The platform will now accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT) and dozens of other cryptocurrencies along with fiat, thereby adopting the technology on a national scale. Merchants that are paid with cryptocurrencies will have the possibility to instantly settle them to fiat or to store them for future purposes.

Bitcoin wins over fiat in unstable economies

Venezuela’s hyperinflation rate hit 10 million percent at some point last year, making it extremely inefficient to store VES, the local sovereign currency, for longer than one day. Although inflation has since slowed, cryptocurrencies remain a much more stable medium of exchange in Carcas, local reports show.

“This is real financial inclusion,” Farias said of the new partnership in an email sent to Cointelegraph, arguing that cryptocurrencies are even more convenient for everyday shopping in countries like Venezuela than foreign fiat currencies:

“The use of cash like US Dollars is complicated by many times not having the necessary change at the time of a purchase forcing people to buy more products than they need is here where the use of cryptocurrencies is much more versatile in countries where payment systems are inefficient”

Farias noted that Cryptobuyer’s solution has already been in use in “more than 400 stores” in Venezuela, including a Burger King branch in the Sambil area of Caracas. The companies will now start activating the crypto-friendly system in thousands of “Merchant Sever”-affiliated businesses. “We must have most of them operational by June,” Farias told Cointelegraph.

When asked whether the new system supports Petro, a controversial cryptocurrency championed by President Nicholas Maduro, the Cryptobuyer CEO replied that it is not something they have contemplated thus far.",

It should take place on May 11, 2020, which is when 210,000 blocks of BTC transactions will have been processed since the last halving event that took place four years ago in 2016.

The Bitcoin (BTC) network and its underlying blockchain technology are essentially a collection of computing nodes spread across the globe.

All full nodes, or BTC transaction validators, have downloaded Bitcoin’s entire transaction history since the digital currency’s genesis (very first) block was generated back in early 2009.

In other words, each of these nodes has stored the complete state of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is the world’s largest, immutable, uncensorable, decentralized record of financial transactions completed using BTC.

Because every full node stores the full Bitcoin transaction history, it becomes extremely difficult, if not practically impossible, to cheat the system as every computing node would reject potentially bad blocks, or fraudulent transactions.

Bitcoin transactions are transparent because they can be viewed by anyone who has access to a block explorer.

There has been a lot of hype as the global Bitcoin community prepares for one of the most significant events in the history of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry: the BTC halving when the leading digital asset’s supply will be cut in half.

Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG), notes that Bitcoin is “verifiably scarce.”

Grayscale, the largest institutional holder of BTC, states:

“While Central Banks can print more of their currencies, as we’re seeing in real time with the trillions of new US Dollars entering circulation this month, the total amount of Bitcoin that will ever enter circulation is limited to 21 million.”

However, the total number of BTC in circulation that will ever be accessible is closer to 16 to 17 million. This, as many Bitcoin holders have irresponsibly lost their private keys or seed, which is the only way to access one’s cryptocurrency holdings. Without it, the funds are lost forever.

Each day, more Bitcoin enters circulation via an energy-intensive process known as mining. At present, there are over 18 million BTC in circulation, with each Bitcoin having been minted through an algorithmic and predictable supply schedule that has been running almost non-stop for over 11 years.

Miners play a key role in Bitcoin’s supply schedule, as they provide the computational power to the cryptocurrency’s blockchain, which is needed to confirm BTC transactions that are carried out between independent network participants. Miners are rewarded with newly minted BTC in exchange for their computing resources which are needed to validate transactions.

As explained by Grayscale, a key economic and technical aspect of the open-source Bitcoin protocol is that the amount of BTC given to miners per block is reduced by 50% after every 4 year period. Or, to be more precise, the supply is cut in half after every 210,000 blocks of BTC transactions have been processed on the cryptocurrency’s network.

The first BTC halving occurred back in 2012, which reduced mining rewards from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The second halving took place in 2016, which cut rewards down further to 12.5 BTC.

At the time of the third halving, which will be around May 11, 2020, the BTC rewards will be reduced to only 6.25 coins.

Grayscale notes:

“Economic theory tells us that if demand for an asset remains constant while supply decreases, the value of the asset will rise.”

Because the BTC halving is a certain and predictable event, it’s easy to check when and by how much the mining reward, and the circulating supply of new BTC, will be reduced.

Many social media users have been asking: Has the Bitcoin halving been priced in?

According to Grayscale and most other analysts:

“Past performance is not indicative of future returns.”

However, it’s worth noting that in the one-year periods right after the first and second BTC halvings, the censorship-resistant cryptocurrency’s value surged by about 81x and 3x, respectively.

The researchers at CoinShares have published a detailed blog post in which they attempt to clarify some of the most confusing or misunderstood concepts related to the Bitcoin halving.

The CoinShares research team writes:

“Even if [we assume] … that markets are … efficient in that … all knowable information is integrated into the price (but to be clear, bitcoin markets can not really be argued as broadly efficient), the future balance of supply and demand in bitcoin markets depend on unknowable information and can therefore not be fully priced in. [Also,] …no one knows the full constitution of the global mining industry and therefore no one fully knows the complete structure of the mining cost curve.”

The company’s blog specifically addresses the following statement:

“Traders who have been Buying the Rumor Will Sell the News.”

CoinShares argues that this hypothesis suggests that there is “significant speculative demand” factored into the current Bitcoin price, mainly because of “bullish narratives” leading up the highly-anticipated halving event.

One could argue that the event is somewhat comparable to equity markets, where there are often rumors of mergers or takeovers.

A widely-employed strategy among traders is attempting to anticipate retail sentiment well before an event and then trying to aggressively buy and/or sell into retail supply and demand when the event actually takes place.

The CoinShares team states:

“This scenario is particularly hard to analyze on merit because it requires access to information that very few traders are likely to share. It is likely in our opinion that at least some speculative demand has been added by the halving narrative, but that flipping this demand into supply in and of itself is unlikely to cause a large price decrease.”

Another common assertion is that the halving will lead to greater selling pressure from Bitcoin miners, which could drive prices down.

When BTC price is greater than miners’ ROI-breakeven mining costs, they don’t need to sell all their Bitcoins that they’re minting on a regular basis. This may lead to a “positive feedback loop on the upside to bitcoin prices during periods of rising prices,” the CoinShares team explains.

When miners have to deal with the BTC price below its ROI-breakeven levels, they are forced to sell all of the Bitcoins they’ve been mining on a regular basis. They also have to, in many cases, use up their reserves, which results in “additional selling pressure on top of their persistent sales,” the researchers at CoinShares argue.

This effect might be “extra pronounced” if the Bitcoin price falls abruptly and unpredictably, as we saw when the leading cryptocurrency crashed by over 50% on March 12-13, 2020, due to uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the CoinShares team points out:

“The halvings … are known in advance. And while the mechanics from the perspective of miners are effectively the same from a 50% price drop and a 50% supply halving, knowing about the event in advance at least offers miners the opportunity to more effectively interact with markets ahead of time.”

It’s worth noting that a price drop doesn’t reduce the actual BTC production rate, and “therefore does not offer any relieving effects on the persistent selling of miners,” the CoinShares team notes.

They add:

“The halving on the other hand does reduce new flow by 50%, thereby providing significant relief on persistent selling pressure even if miners must dip into reserves during a limited transition period.”

Before the current rally, and at a time when the Bitcoin price was significantly lower (late March 2020), the Coin Metrics team had predicted:

“It is concerning that miners are in a state of capitulation even before the halving. Once the block reward halves, miner revenue will be cut in half while miner costs will remain constant, so we expect even more miners to capitulate in the months ahead.”

The argued:

“Miner capitulation increases selling pressure until inefficient miners are forced off the network, but in the long run these events are supportive for prices. Culling inefficient miners allows only the most efficient miners with the lowest cost of production to remain.”

After inefficient miners have left the network, profit margins should begin to improve for the miners who’ve managed to survive. This, the CoinMetrics team claims, helps to lower selling pressure, and then “increases prices, and should repeat in a virtuous cycle.”

They assert that “… eventually, if prices bottom and recover, the pro-cyclical behavior of remaining miners should support further price increases.”

The Coin Metrics team had pointed out that “miner-led selling pressure” for Bitcoin was high and is “likely to increase further in the coming months” as the BTC halving event gets closer.

Coin Metrics’ report, published on March 31, 2020, had stated that they expect miners to “follow a cycle of decreased profit margins, increased selling, capitulation, and a culling of the least efficient miners from the network.”

That was the regular boast of Del Boy to brother Rodney in TV comedy Only Fools And Horses when he had stumbled across 'the next big thing'.

But in recent times such hype has been applied to investing in crypto-currencies – an easy way of turning tech nerds into tycoons.

Indeed, though it may have taken longer than 12 months, had you invested £20 in the crypto-currency Bitcoin a decade ago, you could in theory be a millionaire.

This Tuesday, the bitcoin is expected to undergo a 'halving'. This means the reward for 'mining' new coins will be half what it was.

Five years ago, the Bitcoin traded at £150 a coin, but it is now worth £7,000

Some experts believe it could spark renewed interest in such digital money because only a limited number are in circulation.

Yet as people scramble around for new ways to make money in these challenging times, will bitcoin offer a new opportunity for investors to make a profit?

Or as legendary investor Warren Buffett believes, is it no more than 'rat poison'?

Those of a nervous disposition will not have enjoyed watching the value of shares fall off a cliff, then recover slightly, in recent weeks.

But this roller-coaster ride is nothing compared to the rocket-fuelled adventures of those who have dabbled in crypto-currencies.

One moment they are gambling pocket money, the next they are super-rich. But just when they are poised to cash in those digital chips it can all go horribly wrong – and their investment turns to ashes.

The Bitcoin is the poster boy of 'virtual currencies' though you can also invest in ethereum, ripple, Zcash or dash.

No coins or notes exist – it is just a computer file stored in a 'virtual wallet' to be saved or spent on goods and services with others that accept the technology.

A record of all bitcoins is kept within a 'blockchain' – a computer database of encrypted code files that creates a marketplace for traders.

64-digit number unlocks riches Crypto-currencies are not a physical item, but a unique online registration number that can be stored on a computer. You do not need a pickaxe to mine for a digital currency such as the bitcoin – just a huge computer to go through millions of tricky calculations in the hope that it will unlock a complex mathematical conundrum. The idea is to come up with a '64-digit hexadecimal number' – called a hash – which unlocks access to a hoard of the digital cash. Alternatively, you buy the currency with real money. An early crypto-currency miner was Newport-based IT worker James Howells, who managed to dig up 7,400 bitcoins in 2009 – only to lose them all when he accidentally threw out the hard drive on which the crypto-currency was stored. The virtual money would now be worth more than £50million if he had kept it. He asked Newport City Council if he could delve through 350,000 tons of rubbish at its waste site. It refused.

Five years ago, the bitcoin traded at about £150 a coin, but by the end of 2017 its value had rocketed to £15,000. It is now worth about £7,000.

Charlie Beach works for crypto-currency platform Lendingblock. His message to investors is 'caveat emptor' – let the buyer beware.

He adds: 'Bitcoin is an investment only suitable for the sophisticated investor and even then only as a small part of any portfolio.

'Crypto-currencies have been described as 'digital gold' but this is not the case. During the coronavirus crisis, the value of crypto-currencies has also been hit just like shares.'

Mystique surrounds crypto-currencies, including the view that they are a bit shady. They have a reputation as a currency favoured by criminals for illegal trading and money laundering, but the reality is that even if true the underworld also likes cash.

The origins of bitcoin are not even known, though it is believed to have been created in 2009 by a Japanese computer coding genius going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.

The number of bitcoins in circulation will never exceed 21million because that is how many have been programmed to exist.

They are 'found' by 'mining', a process that requires super-powerful computers to go through reams of mathematical permutations in search of a hidden code.

You also need a lot of luck – it is like searching for a needle in a haystack. So far 17 million have been 'mined'.

Digging up digital money is getting harder. If the bitcoin undergoes a 'halving' this week the reward for successfully mining the crypto-currency will be 6.25 Bitcoins (about £44,000) – half the 12.5 bitcoins you previously were rewarded if you managed to crack the mining code.

The next big thing? My £900 investment is worth £160 Crypto-currency investor Harry Brown has a smartphone app that allows him to keep tabs on his investment in ethereum, a rival to bitcoin. But he believes crypto-currencies are 'all hype' because the £900 investment he made two years ago is now only worth about £160. He chose ethereum because he was told it 'was the next big thing'. The 52-year-old Hertfordshire-based lawyer says: 'I will not sell, but keep the investment as a reminder never again to be gullible enough to fall for such a get-rich-quick scheme. 'These virtual currencies have no real application. I would have been better off buying something tangible, like a second-hand car.' Crypto-currency investor Harry Brown has a smartphone app that allows him to keep tabs on his investment in ethereum, a rival to bitcoin Like many, Harry invested after hearing how others had made a fortune. He had a friend who had turned an investment of £2,000 into £50,000. Harry says: 'It's like a one-armed bandit where you make the odd gain along the way but lose money in the end. 'I kept the investment in the hope of a big rise and have been disappointed. Sadly, my friend has ended up losing most of his cash.' Harry bought ethereum through website Coinbase and paid £20 in commission. He compares his investment with that of 'the tulip craze' in Holland in the 17th Century. Back then, investors were willing to pay escalating amounts for the most rare and beautiful flowers. At the 1637 peak, the most sought-after tulip bulbs traded for 200 florins each – £750,000 in today's money. Prices collapsed when it was realised that they were only buying flowers. Mark Ward, head of trading at wealth manager Sanlam UK, is a sceptic: 'Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies are not true currencies – at least not yet – but commodities. The price of a single tulip bulb in the 1600s could buy a house with an acre of land – even though its intrinsic value and usefulness remained essentially nothing. 'Only time will tell whether crypto-currencies are the tulip-mania of the digital world.'

The 'halving' automatically takes place every time 210,000 'blocks' of Bitcoins are dug up – which happens roughly every four years.

This halving is built into the complex computer programme introduced by mysterious creator Nakamoto in 2009 as part of the process when he created bitcoins.

Financial adviser deVere believes this could spark renewed interest in the digital cash – boosting a Bitcoin's value short term to £8,000.

Nigel Green, chief executive, says: 'Investors are increasing their exposure to bitcoin as supply decreases and prices rise.'

Trading platform eToro also believes the publicity surrounding the halving of mining rewards may attract new customers to the digital cash.

For most people, the best way to get hold of Bitcoins is via an online trader such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bittylicious or Bitstamp.

You do not have to purchase single Bitcoins – you can invest in fractions.

You can buy a hundred millionth of a bitcoin – known as a Satoshi, which is worth about 0.007p.

There are only a limited number of goods and services you can spend your crypto-currencies on – most shops still view it as a gimmick.

You can use bitcoins to buy computer games from Microsoft, soaps from shopping chain Lush and even to make a donation to the RNLI.

Some experts believe that one day it will be cheaper to trade in crypto-currency as it cuts out all the middlemen – such as commission-charging banks and card providers.

By its own standards, bitcoin has achieved a certain stability, in that its price in recent weeks – in the range of $7,000 to $9,000 – is in the same ball park as it was 12 months ago. Bitcoin remains highly volatile: its price all but halved between mid-February and mid-March (as financial markets took fright at Covid-19), before running back up again strongly since then. It remains primarily a tool for speculators, rather than a means of exchange or store of value. Yet the cryptocurrency has nevertheless defied predictions – following the popped bubble of 2017 – that it would collapse, or become near-worthless. The crash was spectacular and several other cryptocurrencies fell even more steeply (over 90% falls). But one bitcoin remains around half the value of the all-time peak (near $20,000) in December 2017. It bottomed out a year later, at around $3,200 – and in the year and a half since then it’s been on a rising trend, which bitcoin boosters hope will get an extra lift from the imminent “bitcoin halving”.

What’s a bitcoin halving?

A halving of the rate at which new bitcoins are created, by making them harder to mine. At some point in the next few days (either Monday or Tuesday) the 18,375,000th bitcoin will be generated by its decentralised community of digital miners, after which the rewards for miners producing bitcoin will be cut in half – making it twice as difficult (and twice as energy-intensive) to produce new bitcoins. This halving (or “halvening” to some crypto-purists) takes place about every four years: previous halvings took place in 2012 and 2016, and the process is a key part of the mathematical code underpinning the bitcoin project.

What’s its purpose?

Part of what makes bitcoin distinctive, and underpins its claim to credibility as a store of value, is its cap on supply: only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created, and more than 18.3 million of these have already been mined. The halving process is built into this model as a way of promoting the system’s viability by ensuring scarcity and curbing runaway inflation. Bitcoin works by using powerful computers to verify each block of blockchain transactions every ten minutes or so. When bitcoin was launched, the “block reward” for verifying each block was set at 50 bitcoins, but every 210,000 blocks, that reward is halved. This latest halving will take the reward down from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins – meaning that lots of miners will shut up shop, since it will no longer be profitable for them to mine the cryptocurrency.

Why might this boost the price?

There’s no special reason why it should, other than increased scarcity – and that ought to be priced in well in advance, since the halving has been known about for years. But the bitcoin market is not known for cool rationality and bitcoin boosters look back lovingly at previous halvings. The first presaged a 100-fold rise in the price from about $10 in late 2012 to about $1,000 a year later. The second, in July 2016, came when the price had eased back to about $650 – but over the following 18 months it rocketed to almost $20,000. The ultimate bitcoin booster is the former Goldman Sachs hedge-fund manager Raoul Pal, who argues that the price of one bitcoin could reach $1m (a further 100-fold rise) before the next halving event in 2024. In his April report for his Global Macro Investor service, Pal argues that bitcoin will become a safe-haven asset. “Gold is the protection of our assets. Bitcoin is the call option on the future system. Both are going to save us and probably make us rich,” he says.

Is that plausible?

It would certainly imply a total paradigm shift from the scepticism with which cryptocurrencies are regarded by many institutional investors. Some analysts suspect the vast post-Covid fiscal stimulus could be the inflationary spark that sets off such a shift. “If we get a pickup in inflation, bitcoin’s price will become unhinged,” reckons Clem Chambers in Forbes. Yet the core problems with cryptocurrencies are well known and haven’t changed. The technology is too clunky and energy-intensive to operate at scale, and the sector is riddled with fraud and incompetence – and of most use to organised criminals. Since transactions are irreversible, Ponzi schemes and cons are ten a penny, and cryptocurrency exchanges often collapse or get hacked. For all these reasons, most commentators don’t see cryptocurrencies entering the mainstream.

What about digital money more broadly?

Proponents argue that the Covid-19 emergency has highlighted the usefulness of cryptocurrencies. But it has also demonstrated the enduring power of the state – and recent months have seen two developments that suggest the future may belong more to state-backed digital currencies than to bitcoin and its ilk. First, last month Facebook unveiled its revamped proposal for its transnational Libra currency. The new version is much less like bitcoin and much more conventional: it has abandoned the distinctive open architecture of cryptocurrencies and is instead more like a traditional payment network in which coins will be tied to a local currency, a bit like the digital dollars in a PayPal account.

And the other development?

Second, partly spurred by Libra, several countries – in particular China – have accelerated plans for their own digital currencies. China began work on its plans for the world’s first “central-bank digital currency” in 2014 and has just begun a pilot scheme in collaboration with the country’s four biggest commercial banks. Some expect the digital yuan to be launched later this year – a potential landmark in the story of digital currencies. A digital yuan is expected to give Chinese authorities the power to track digital cash, cut tax avoidance and precision-tool monetary policy. What it definitely won’t be is a beacon of decentralised, permissionless control and fiat-free liberty.",2020-05-06 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-suffers-brief-outage-as-bitcoin-tumbles-10-in-30-minutes,"Coinbase experienced a brief outage Saturday as the price of bitcoin crashed 10% in 30 minutes.

According to Coinbase’s status page, the exchange’s website, mobile app, and API website experienced partial outages beginning at 17:26 Pacific time (00:26 UTC). Ten minutes later, the San Francisco-based company said it was still investigating. Prominent Twitter accounts also noted Coinbase’s outage as the price of Bitcoin tumbled from $9,500 to $8,100.

By 18:14 UTC on the West Coast, service had been restored for the San Francisco-based company’s consumer and professional trading sites. Reached Saturday evening, a spokesperson for Coinbase declined to comment beyond what was on the status page, which said the exchange was monitoring the situation.

Other U.S. exchanges, including Kraken, reported all systems as operational during the weekend price crash.

Coinbase experienced a similar outage last week when bitcoin rallied 15% to $8,900. At the time of publishing, Coinbase’s volume was not excessively high relative to other peaks in trading volume during the past two weeks, according to data provider Skew.

A court in Shanghai, China, has reportedly ruled that bitcoin is an asset protected by Chinese law in a case that has dragged on for years. The case involves a theft of two different cryptocurrencies, one being bitcoin, from an American. The defendants argued that bitcoin was not recognized under Chinese law; the court disagreed, citing documents by the central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).

In China, Bitcoin Is Asset Protected by Law

Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People’s Court has reportedly ruled on a bitcoin case that has dragged on for multiple years, Chinese media reported on Thursday. The case involved three Chinese and a Malaysian who broke into the home of an American and his Chinese wife on the night of June 12, 2018, East China daily media Shine detailed. After locking the couple up and beating them, the intruders forced them to transfer 18.88 bitcoins and 6,466 skycoins to their account.

The first hearing of this case found that there was an economic dispute and the perpetrators were sentenced to prison for six and a half months to eight months. The defendants agreed to give all the skycoins back but not bitcoins, arguing that cryptocurrencies were not assets under Chinese law so the couple did not have the right to demand them back. The court disagreed and ordered them to return all the cryptocurrencies they took from the couple or pay them what the coins were worth. When the couple received neither the bitcoins nor the equivalent funds, they filed a lawsuit.

The four defendants appealed, reiterating that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and skycoin, were not legal property under Chinese law. However, Shine news outlet reported on Thursday that the Shanghai court has ordered them to return the coins, adding:

The court found bitcoin to be a digital asset that should be protected by law.

Liu Jiang, the chief judge in the case, explained that the documents released by the central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), have never denied bitcoin as an asset and the laws in China do not prohibit citizens from holding them.

Several other Chinese courts have made a similar ruling on cryptocurrency. For example, the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration recognized cryptocurrencies in a case involving 20 bitcoins, 50 bitcoin cash, and 13 bitcoin diamond in 2018. Last year, the Hangzhou Internet Court also legally recognized bitcoin. Recently, the Shenzhen Futian District People’s Court in Guangdong Province declared ethereum legal property in China.

This week filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann launched the cryptocurrency-infused documentary “Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet.” Cryptopia discusses the powerful economy and flourishing ideas that stemmed from Satoshi’s invention through the eyes of some of the industry’s well known movers and shakers.

Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains and the Future of the Internet

The three-time award-winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann is back again after his acclaimed film “Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It.” Hoffmann’s latest picture stars people like Andreas Antonopoulos, Roger Ver, Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Preethi Kasireddy, Wences Casares, and Laura Shin. The film discusses how bitcoin and the technology and applications that stem from it, have and continue to transform our world for the better. Further, the film touches on web 3.0, decentralized finance, and a few different themes than the last documentary. Anyone can visit the official website and watch the movie for a ticket price of $5.88 (5.40 euros) or 0.0007 BTC.

Antonopoulos is featured throughout the film and during the movie, the crypto evangelist said: “We don’t have broad enough adoption and we don’t have a long-term perspective to be able to determine whether cryptocurrencies will be good as a medium of exchange or store of value. The market will decide. What bitcoin is in Venezuela is different from what it is in San Francisco,” he added. Bitcoin.com’s Executive Chairman Roger Ver was also featured in the documentary speaking on forwarding economic freedom. “If you look around the world,” Ver stressed. “The way that governments finance most of their wars is through the printing of money, not through direct taxation.” Ver continued by adding:

So if we can strip away the government’s ability to print money at will, we can strip away most of their power to wage these wars.

The Bitcoin Scaling Debate Highlighted

The film also touches on the scaling debate and Ver explains his distaste for the censorship that stemmed from the moderators of forums like r/bitcoin and people who consider themselves “toxic bitcoin maximalists.” It is well known that for years, thousands of comments on r/bitcoin were censored if anyone discussed the scaling topic or even if they quoted Satoshi’s own words.

“If you don’t support free speech, you don’t support Bitcoin,” Ver highlighted during the documentary. You are an enemy of Bitcoin. In fact, I myself have tried simply posting just a direct quote from Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin… word for word from Satoshi. I have had that very quote deleted. They are literally censoring words from the creator of Bitcoin,” Ver added.

Some other comments from the cast were Litecoin’s creator Charlie Lee and Blockstream’s Samson Mow. Lee noted that “in order for cryptocurrencies to thrive we need to work with the current financial system.” Meanwhile, Mow discussed the company’s notorious satellite project saying: “Blockstream satellite is a needed technology in order for bitcoin to become the foundation of a new global financial system.” In order to catch the rest of the commentary from the crypto industry’s biggest names, you’ll have to grab a ticket from Hoffmann’s Cryptopia website.

Hoffman said that the first film had a lower budget and this time around, the team put 8X the funding into Cryptopia. Screen Australia, A German broadcast co-production helped bolster the production costs. “This allowed us to tell our story in a more ambitious cinematic universe. Elaborate 3D animations were created to illustrate blockchain’s inner workings. We fly 5-person crews into a remote part of Switzerland to a secret location. We filmed consistently with two 4k cameras and partially even in 8k resolution,” Hoffman detailed during the release this week. You can check out the trailer below and also see the whole film at the Cryptopia website.

With its flagship AntMiner bitcoin mining equipment still dominating the hardware market and its mining pools accounting for about a quarter of the Bitcoin network’s computing power, it retains a uniquely powerful place in the ecosystem of by far the largest cryptocurrency and blockchain project.

That’s not to say it isn’t also controversial. Its vocal support for a Bitcoin hard fork (Bitcoin Cash) in 2017, following contentious community disagreement, won the company, and its masterminds, many enemies.

This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.

Over the years, Bitmain has been involved in many controversial developments to the point that the Chinese crypto community refers to its foes as the “mining avengers.” In 2017, Bitmain filed a lawsuit against Yang Zuoxing, the former design chief behind Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 who started a rival miner manufacturer MicroBT, over patent infringement. But Bitmain lost the case eventually.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Then in 2018, it brought another lawsuit over non-compete violation against the former creators of Bitman’s mining pool BTC.com, who left the company to start a rival service PoolIn, which has become the world’s top two bitcoin mining pool by total hash rate.

Bitmain’s story started with Wu Jihan, one of the earliest bitcoin evangelists in China, translating Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper to Chinese in 2011.

The AntMiner S3, released in 2014, was used by a number of crypto notables when Bitcoin mining was still a hobbyist pursuit.

He invested in probably the world’s first known bitcoin-denominated initial public offering in 2012. It was a project started by Jiang Xinyu, a.k.a Friedcat., who was crowdfunding bitcoin to roll out an application-specific integrated circuit just for bitcoin mining.

The hardware sold well initially and sensational success followed. In 2013, Wu, with a finance and psychology degree from China’s prestigious Peking University, decided to start his own company to manufacture mining hardware. He was joined by Zhan Ketuan, his partner on the technology side, who, in six years, would find himself ousted from the company in a coup started by Wu.

Bitcoin’s last halving event in the summer 2016 marked the beginning of two years of extraordinary growth at Bitmain.

In 2017 alone, still only four years old, it made $1 billion in profits. It made another $1 billion for the first six months in 2018 and then went on a high-profile fundraise in the summer, netting $700 million from external shareholders with a bet. The deal is this: if Bitmain can’t go public within five years since the fundraise at an agreed term, external investors could require the company to redeem all of their investment with an interest.

At that time, Bitmain was boasting a hardware market share of nearly 80 percent. So the agreed term for the IPO was nothing but ambitious: raising at least $500 million at a valuation of no less than $18 billion.

So much has changed in 2019, since its first IPO attempt failed in March in Hong Kong.

Its rising rival, MicroBT, whose founder won over Bitmain’s patent infringement lawsuit, is seriously undermining Bitmain’s market dominance.

In 2019, Bitmain’s mining pools BTC.com and Antpool lost the top two spots to F2Pool and Poolin, the latter of which still has an ongoing case with Bitmain over alleged non-compete violation.

When Wu Jihan returned in a coup in November 2019 to kick out his founding partner Zhan, he told his people he’s back to save the sinking ship. Whether his tough comeback will work as he expected is yet to be proven, although it appears prepared to roll out more powerful equipment to weather the upcoming halving.",2020-05-09 13:13:46+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/64612/web-traffic-crypto-exchanges-april,"Data from traffic tracking platform SimilarWeb indicates that the number of visits to crypto exchanges fell in April compared to March.

His research focuses on issues related to cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currency. The views expressed here are his and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.

The imminent halving of the “block subsidy” exposes a fundamental threat to Bitcoin. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, a quantum of new bitcoins is created and paid to the miner adding the block. As miners compete for this subsidy, they drive up the system’s difficulty, making it harder for so-called 51% attacks to succeed. But the subsidy is set to diminish over time, halving very soon to 6.25 bitcoins per block, so that the total supply of coins will eventually reach 21 million. And as the subsidy shrinks, Bitcoin could fall victim to 51% attacks, just as smaller cryptocurrencies already have.

Raphael Auer is a speaker at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's free virtual conference running May 11-15. Register here.

Yet, a future in which Bitcoin is plagued by 51% attacks is just one of the possible outcomes. In this column, I introduce the notion of a “security trilemma” to illustrate how the Bitcoin ecosystem could evolve as the subsidy falls. This trilemma refers to trade-offs that influence how well Bitcoin can function without the block subsidy.

Put simply, “you can’t have it all,” and, once the subsidy shrinks beyond a certain point, users will have to accept compromises along at least one of three dimensions. In the future, Bitcoin will either become more centralized (i.e. rely on institutions to function), or its liquidity could dry up, or its supply needs to grow beyond the originally envisioned 21 million coins.

The role of the block subsidy for payment security

The extent to which Bitcoin depends on the block subsidy to function cannot be overstated. Looking at this issue in a BIS working paper, I showed a cryptocurrency that relies on proof-of-work to ensure payment finality is subject to two economic limitations.

The first lies in the extreme costs of ensuring payment finality within a reasonable space of time. For a start, miners’ income needs to be very high to deter 51% attacks. According to my calculations, for payments to be made irreversible within six blocks (i.e. roughly one hour), a miners’ income must amount to 8.3% of the transaction volume – a multiple of the transaction fees currently levied in today’s conventional payment services.

Bitcoin will either become more centralized..., or its liquidity could dry up, or its supply needs to grow beyond the originally envisioned 21 million coins.

The second limitation is that Bitcoin transaction fees alone cannot generate an adequate level of income for miners. Today, users pay an average fee of less than $1 per transaction. Each block can include up to about 3,500 transactions, but total fee income still adds up to only a fraction of the value of the block subsidy. In fact, the subsidy typically makes up over 99% of the total income (see Graph 1 below, left-hand side).

The paltry level of fees adds up to a classical “free-rider problem”: for any given transaction, the proof-of-work, and hence the security level, is determined at the level of its block. In contrast, the fee is set by each user privately. While each user stands to benefit if the miner reaps a high income, users have no incentive to contribute to that income with the fees they each pay. Taken together, these observations suggest that the liquidity of Bitcoin is set to deteriorate substantially with every halving.

As miner income falls, so does the system’s difficulty, and users will have to wait longer and longer before they can safely assume that a payment has gone through. The number of required confirmations will have to increase. My research (Graph 1, right-hand panel) indicates that, towards the end of this decade, it could take several hours or even days for payments to become irreversible. Eventually – i.e. once the block subsidy is phased out completely – waiting times could lengthen to months.

Graph 1 Source: Auer, BIS working paper, 2019.

The security trilemma: in search of a Plan B for Bitcoin

Bitcoin will start to function differently as the block subsidy falls. One option, simulated above, is that transactions will require more and more confirmations. But this is not the only possible outcome. The range of scenarios can be visualized by adapting Vitalik Buterin’s “Scalability Trilemma” to the specific outlook for Bitcoin.

Graph 2 Source: The author

Bitcoin faces a “security trilemma” and a range of possible outcomes (see Graph 2). This trilemma means that, of the three properties that today make Bitcoin desirable to its fans (scarcity, decentralisation, and a liquid blockchain trading market), compromises will have to be made in at least one dimension. Bitcoin could become less liquid, or its protocol could be changed so that supply will eventually exceed 21 million, or it could become more centralized.

Scenarios involving lower liquidity

Scenarios involving lower liquidity mean that on-chain bitcoin trading will either be much slower or subject to much higher fees than is the case today. The most straightforward scenario is that the system remains unchanged and fees continue to be low, but that more confirmations are needed, as discussed above.

However, there is also another scenario involving lower liquidity, which is to create higher fees. This could, for example, be achieved via deliberately creating congestion. When newly added blocks are already at the maximum size permitted by the protocol, the system congests and transactions go into a queue. Users who want to have their transactions processed immediately start setting higher fees. During the peak crypto-hype in late 2017, transaction fees spiked to more than $50 per transaction in this way (see Graph 1, left-hand side). In the future, such congestion could also be created artificially, by adjusting the maximum number of transactions that Bitcoin can process.

Scenarios involving less scarcity

A very controversial scenario involves a substantial departure from Nakamoto’s initial design: continued supply growth. For example, one of the options discussed by researchers Hasu, Prestwich and Curtis is to change the protocol so that the supply of bitcoin will continue to grow beyond 21 million – for example by 1% annually. This would address the problem of the declining block subsidy head-on. However, as Hasu and colleagues note, such proposals have been met with scepticism for a number of reasons. A primary one is that many now see digital scarcity as Bitcoin’s prime virtue. Thus, while it remains a theoretical option, expanding the supply beyond 21 million would seem an unlikely scenario.

Scenarios involving less decentralization

A third set of possible outcomes involves less decentralization and some institutionalization. This could take several forms, including mining cartels. Even today, mining is dominated by a small number of large players. This can be a big issue when it comes to censorship resistance, but the upshot is that these large players have strategic incentives to guard transactions and thus protect their investment in mining equipment.

In the future, it is possible that miners might form cartels that would coordinate with each other to respond against any 51% attacks. MIT researchers Moroz, Aronoff, Narula and Parkes have analyzed the potential for double-spend counterattacks in the case of a single miner. If several miners were to be involved, this would require some kind of institutionalization – i.e. an agreement to ensure that the cooperation between the miners would work smoothly.

But institutionalization could also take other forms. For example, it might involve “proof-of-stake,” i.e. replacing costly proof-of-work computations with an essentially resource-free betting game. Why should this involve institutionalization? With proof-of-work, miners will normally follow the longest chain when choosing between blockchains, should these ever conflict. With proof-of-stake, the absence of an actual cost opens the door to so-called long-run attacks.

This is a problem that Buterin termed “weak subjectivity.” It implies that successful proof-of-stake implementations might need to rest on some central contact point that guides newcomers to the “honest” blockchain. It remains to be seen how well such arrangements might work.

The last option for institutionalization involves custody and off-chain trading on regulated exchanges. For years, bitcoin has traded on specialized exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken. More recently, some trading activity has developed on Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. In the future, an increased share of trading could migrate to such regulated market places.

Of course, any such development would come with regulatory issues similar to those in standard financial markets. Starting with Mt. Gox, billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies have been lost or stolen in recent years, as unregulated exchanges turned out to be fraudulent or simply incompetent. The industry could benefit from better regulation. That imminent regulation is not always bad news for cryptocurrencies, according to BIS research, adds to this case.

And regulation can also be adapted to the technology of cryptocurrencies, as I have outlined in another BIS working paper. The idea of “embedded supervision” is that the financial supervisor ensures that funds deposited with an exchange are fully backed by on-chain bitcoin holdings. Data delivery is automated, with the financial supervisor directly reading the ownership balances in the Bitcoin blockchain. In this way investors are protected, and the administrative burden on the crypto-exchange is kept to a minimum.

The road ahead: If not money, then what?

As the block subsidy falls, the Bitcoin ecosystem will need to change – not to grow, but just to limit the fallout. The future is likely to entail a steady transition to regulated exchanges, with fewer anonymous trades on the blockchain, and miners playing a lesser role.

As this is a far cry from the proclaimed revolution, the core value proposition of Bitcoin may well need to be re-evaluated. In all likelihood, Bitcoin’s long-run outlook will depend on the applications that can be made to run on top of it, and how well such applications get traction and generate revenue. In this, Bitcoin’s core asset may well turn out to be less the original proof-of-work-based technology than its large community of fans and developers, as well as the penumbra of media attention it continues to attract.",2020-05-10 12:11:39+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-tests-10-000-halving-dump-1m-btc-predicted-hodlers-digest-may-410,"Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week.

Top Stories This Week

We’re less than 48 hours away from “the halvening” — and there’s been no end of drama over the past week. Initially, there was hype as Bitcoin soared, with the world’s biggest cryptocurrency testing $10,000. But over the weekend, a dramatic and sudden sell-off began — a sharp correction that caused BTC to slide all the way back to $8,100. Bitcoin plunged by 9% in a single hour as it failed to tackle the $10,200-to-$10,500 range, which has historically served as a strong level of resistance. Some analysts had been arguing that a sell-off was inevitable because BTC was overbought, but even they were predicting that this would happen after the halving. The big question now is whether that “fear of missing out” remains, whether Bitcoin can bounce back, and whether crypto executives, such as Decred Founder Joseph Young, believe prices will “roughly double” in the short term.

It’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the impact that the halving will have on miners. A supply shock is imminent — and once it’s taken place, only 900 new Bitcoin will be entering circulation per day, a sharp decrease from the 1,800 we’ve had for four years. Data suggests that miners are hoarding BTC ahead of the halving, with ByteTree suggesting that higher prices are ahead of us. Many miners will see the expense associated with mining a single Bitcoin rise substantially, far beyond the average of $6,851 reported earlier this year. Some estimates suggest that it could cost anywhere between $12,000 and $15,000 in the not-too-distant future, and this means prices would have to rise if miners have any hope of breaking even.

There are several one-off factors that make this halving different from the ones we saw in 2012 and 2016. One of them is the coronavirus crisis — and as countries around the world print trillions of dollars in new money to save their economies, some pundits believe investors will plow into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. There’s also substantially more institutional interest in BTC than there was before. Even senior analysts at Bloomberg, such as Mike McGlone, are bullish — arguing that Bitcoin has a big advantage over long-established assets such as gold. “Restricted supply means adoption is the metric that matters, and most indications remain positive in an unprecedented environment where virtually every central bank is aggressively adding liquidity,” he said.

Telegram suffered a massive slap to the face this week when an independent group of software developers, validators and users launched the “Free TON Blockchain.” The rival platform comes as the messaging app continues to be embroiled in a long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This breakaway community says Telegram “can no longer be involved in the project.” The launch came after U.S. investors who invested in TON were told that they won’t be eligible for a 110% refund of their money in April 2021 — and instead, they’ll only get 72% of their capital back now. Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, has reacted furiously to the legal battles brought by the SEC, describing the U.S. as a “police state” and discouraging entrepreneurs from moving their businesses to Silicon Valley.

YouTube has signed a new deal with one of the world’s most popular content creators. PewDiePie has been wrestled away from the blockchain platform DLive, meaning he’ll be broadcasting exclusively on the Google-owned video-sharing site. Although PewDiePie was full of praise for DLive because of how they didn’t take large chunks of his revenue as commission, he failed to build anywhere near as much of an audience — attracting barely 1% of the 104 million subscribers he had on YouTube.

Most Memorable Quotations

“The power has shifted away from miners. They’re not in the same position as they used to be ten years ago or even five years ago.” Arnaud Salomon, Mt Pelerin CEO

“BTC has just scraped above $10,000 for the first time since mid-February, and an understated aspect of this impressive price surge (overshadowed by halvening news) is the fact that Bitcoin’s development activity rate has grown notably throughout 2020.” Santimant, on-chain data research firm

“I definitely think that there’s a role for blockchains — and Ethereum in particular — to play in being this kind of neutral global player role [for] these systems, currencies, and applications to interact. I think anything created and maintained by nation-states can’t play that role.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder

“Legal proceedings in the U.S. mean that Telegram, the initial creator of TON (Telegram/The Open Network) blockchain, can no longer be involved.” Free TON Community

“He [Schiff] tweets more #bitcoin than gold. And his commenters/followers are all bitcoin people. He is the sheep in wolf’s skin.” Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO

“If there’s no halvening dump soon, BTC could run straight to ATH.” Logan Han, hedge fund manager

“I will go dark if the model is successful because if the model is successful, it will not be a pretty picture.” PlanB, crypto analyst

“If this relationship holds... bitcoin would peak at $115,212 /BTC… I realize that price may sound ludicrous to some today... Just sayin’ that there’s more than a 50-50 chance bitcoin goes up – and goes up big.” Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital founder and CEO

“Now that Buffett is out of the game and stock buybacks are rightly being called out as fraudulent, investors will ask... If Buffett was dead wrong about so much, was he also wrong about #Bitcoin and Gold? ANSWER: YES. Buffett killed his reputation by being stupid about BTC.” Max Keiser, TV host

Prediction of the Week

The chances that Bitcoin will hit $40,000 and even $1 million have “risen dramatically” after it hit $10,000, according to Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal. The sky-high figures fall in line with similar findings by PlanB, who has projected that BTC/USD could hit $288,000 between 2020 and 2024, with the potential to at least double that as a maximum. There have been plenty of other upbeat predictions this week. Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko believes Bitcoin’s price will shoot up by more than 1,000% as early as next year — adding that, if BTC’s market cap achieves the same value as that of gold, Bitcoin could soar beyond $100,000 at some point between 2021 and 2022. That forecast was echoed by Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead, who said there’s more than a 50/50 chance that Bitcoin goes up “and goes up big” — with $100,000 possible by August next year.

FUD of the Week

Analysis of Jeb McCaleb’s wallets appears to show that the Ripple co-founder sold off at least 54 million in XRP over the course of April. According to The Crypto Associate, McCaleb is liquidating his supply of tokens on a regular basis — and on average, he flogged 1.8 million XRP every day in April. The proceeds from these sales would come to a grand total of $11.7 million. McCaleb is a key figure in cryptocurrency’s history, having created the Mt. Gox exchange and co-founding Stellar. He also co-founded OpenCoin in 2012, which later became Ripple, and was allocated 9.5 billion XRP when the 100 billion supply was pre-mined.

It’s a case that’s gripped the crypto community for years. Now, we know that the trial between self-proclaimed Bitcoin investor Craig Wright and the brother of his former business partner is going to begin in July. Ira Kleiman lays claim to half of the 1.1 million BTC that the Australian entrepreneur allegedly mined with Dave Kleiman before his death. Wright, one of the crypto world’s more colorful characters, has certainly had quite a week. He has faced yet another allegation of committing plagiarism — this time, in his doctoral thesis. A blogger has posted purported screenshots of Wright’s 2017 thesis that appears to show similarities with other publicly available sources.

A teenager is being sued for $71.4 million in damages for allegedly stealing $23.8 million in cryptocurrency from an investor in 2018. Ellis Pinsky was just 15 at the time of the alleged crime, and it’s claimed he and his co-conspirators pulled off the theft by swapping Michael Terpin’s SIM without his knowledge. Terpin says that he has managed to recover $2 million — but now Pinsky is 18, and he has filed a lawsuit to sue for the remaining funds, plus damages. The plaintiff has already managed to win a $75 million civil case against an alleged co-conspirator, and according to court documents, he says: “On the surface, Pinsky is an ‘All American Boy.’ The tables are now turned.”

Experts weigh in on the ongoing gold-versus-Bitcoin debate: Which asset is more capable in these current times?

The Bitcoin halving and coronavirus are still dominating media headlines. Here are five things to do while waiting for both events to end.

Regulation is one of the biggest hurdles for crypto in India as exchanges continue the legal battle to establish a clear framework, as Jinia Shawdagor explains.",,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-plunges-anticipation-block-reward-halving/,"Key Takeaways Bitcoin's price action resembles that of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV before their respective halvings, according to an analysis by OKEx.

BTC is being propped up by strong support around $8,000, which may prevent further losses and act as a springboard for BTC to reach higher highs.

If enough selling pressure continues, however, then Bitcoin could drop to $7,000, erasing weeks of gains.

Share this article

Bitcoin plunged more than 20% today, creating massive liquidations across the market. Nonetheless, several technical patterns show that robust support around $8,000 will keep BTC from a further decline.

Similar Patterns Around the Halving

OKEx appears to have predicted the price action that Bitcoin is currently going through. The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange analyzed how other altcoins behaved before and after their respective halvings.

Bitcoin Cash, for instance, went through a bullish impulse that saw its price rise over 38% in anticipation of its block rewards reduction event. Following the drop in its rate of issuance, there was a significant increase in the selling pressure behind BCH that ignited a 27% correction.

Similarly, Bitcoin SV surged by more than 55% before its halving to hit a high of $227. But after the event took place, the hype around BSV faded, according to web search volume. Consequently, BSV entered a corrective phase and declined by nearly 20%.

With this information, OKEx suggested that a simple trade based on the “buy the rumor, sell news” scheme. The firm recommended to “long before halving, short on the halving date, and unwind the final position three days after halving.”

“The theory behind it is that due to the heated discussion and news on halving, the demand for that coin will increase prior to the event; but as the news dies down after it halves, the buying pressure is gone and the coin price would drop,” said OKEx.

While accurate, the firm was not the only able to forecast a similar scenario. There are multiple indexes and prominent analysts within the industry that have been warning about the possibility of a correction. Now that the retracement is here, a massive support level lies ahead.

Considerable Support Ahead of Bitcoin

The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 21% in the past 50 hours. It went from a high of $10,080 to a recent low of $7,940, which is exactly where the 200 and 100-day moving averages sit.

This substantial demand barrier appears to have been able to hold and prevent BTC from a further downturn. Indeed, it rejected the price of Bitcoin, sending it back above $8,600.

From a different perspective, the rejection appears to have come from the lower boundary of an ascending parallel channel where Bitcoin has been contained since the March crypto-market free-fall.

Since then, each time BTC rises to the upper boundary of the channel, it drops down to hit the lower boundary, and from this point, it bounces back up again. This is consistent with the characteristics of a channel.

If the parallel channel continues to hold, it is reasonable to expect that the bellwether cryptocurrency could pull back to its upper boundary. As it has happened over the past three months, a full-blown rebound may take some days to materialize, but it is very possible.

For this to happen, Bitcoin must continue to trade above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. A spike in demand around this area could even send BTC back to the top of the channel and make it retest the mid-February high of $10,500.

Nonetheless, the interest that Bitcoin’s halving generated among market participants may be weakening as it happened for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Under such circumstances, the bears will have to break below an important area of support that sits between $8,000 and $7,700.

The massive demand barrier is represented by the 200, 100, and 50-day moving averages, the lower boundary of the channel, and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Only moving past this support wall will add credence to the idea of a further decline towards $7,000 or even $6,000.

BTC Moving Forward

The downward momentum that Bitcoin saw recently was fueled by a massive number of long positions that were liquidated across the board. On BitMEX alone, data reveals that today over $246.5 million were wiped out of those investors who were betting to the upside.

Along the same lines, cryptocurrency trader “J0E007” has vanished from the face of the industry after his unrealized losses on Bitfinex amounted to over $21 million. The Bitcoin whale was best known for ranking first on the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange’s leaderboard due to his massive gains. But the recent price action appears to have melted his trading capital.

BTC can destroy traders who neglect risk management. However, Bitcoin’s volatility also provides opportunities not seen in any other market. By exercising patience and only trading with a smaller portion of a diversified portfolio, then it is possible to capture a piece of this price action.",2020-05-10 08:40:42+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-dominance-is-making-investors-rich-thanks-to-crypto-hedge-funds,"National economies are sinking into a recession but the bitcoin economy remains healthy and is still growing throughout the coronavirus crisis, even surging to $10,000 on May 7.

Crypto hedge funds, in particular, are reaping the benefits of volatility. For example, Eric Ervin, co-founder of Blockforce Capital in San Diego, said his fund’s returns are up 18% so far in 2020.

“In these wild months, we’re capturing half of the upside,” Ervin said, referring to the economic rollercoaster that took off in March. “Bitcoin’s really taken a lot of market share back from Ethereum … really dominated as Ethereum tries to figure itself out.”

It’s important to note bitcoin’s market dominance during a global crisis is a cause of correlation, not causation. The godfather cryptocurrency was already surging in 2019. According to the annual report released Monday by Elwood Asset Management and the consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the value of assets under management at crypto hedge funds more than doubled in 2019 to reach $2 billion.

According to PwC partner Henri Arslanian, co-author of the report that surveyed over 50 funds, more crypto hedge funds trade ether (ETH), 67%, than any type of crypto derivatives (56%), although bitcoin still reigned supreme in 2019 (97%).

Arslanian said the coronavirus crisis inspired more investors to adamantly ask how hedge fund managers reduce counterparty risks, for example, not leaving too much money on any single exchange. If these concerns are quelled, more investors appear eager to enter the market, he said.

“One macro trend we’ve seen since the coronavirus is more general interest in cryptocurrencies,” Arslanian told CoinDesk in an interview.

The vast majority of these funds serve family offices and high-net-worth individuals, an average of 28 individuals per fund, suggesting the technology’s leading use case isn’t “financial inclusion” quite yet. (Many of these funds alone represent more global market share than the known peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volumes of some countries.)

This is why bitcoin appears to be correlated to traditional assets like stocks. When the same small groups own significant chunks of multiple markets, their behavior influences those markets in similar ways. Diversifying ownership is the only way to decorrelate an asset class. In the meantime, traders and investors are making a killing.

The PwC report found the percentage of crypto hedge funds with more than $20 million under management jumped up from 19% to 35% of surveyed funds – shocking growth considering the median starting point for these funds was $2 million.

“We’re starting to notice people are taking our calls a little bit more. There’s a little more interest,” Blockforce Capital’s Ervin said.

Volatility veterans

Plus, the market shocks in March didn’t feel like an emergency to veteran bitcoin traders.

Paul Veradittakit, co-founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, agreed, saying his fund spent a lot of time so far in 2020 educating nervous investors.

“We wanted to make sure the investors knew what was going on in the market,” Veradittakit said. “We’re rebalancing a bit more into bitcoin to focus on what we think will be the rallying point for crypto during this time.”

Although the venture arm of Pantera is now focused on fewer startups and ensuring those investments have at least 18 months of runway, Veradittakit said overall 2020 has seen the fund’s largest amount of deployed capital to date. A few funds, including Scalar Capital and Polychain Capital, declined to offer comment on their updated strategies by press time.

“[Black Thursday] wasn’t that uncharacteristic of bitcoin, historically,” Ervin said, adding the same concept applies to ETH, which outperformed bitcoin in some previous years.

“[Big business] has embraced Ethereum, and that’s meaningful,” Ervin said. “There’s a significant amount of resources dedicated to Ethereum.”

That’s why the competition is more crowded than ever before. The PwC report tallied at least 150 active crypto hedge funds, more than 63% of which were launched in the past two years. All things considered, PwC’s Arslanian said he expects investors to learn about the market through institutions and eventually bring some of that trading activity in-house.",2020-05-11 00:01:00+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/05/10/bitcoin-thesis-from-billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-makes-powerful-case-for-cryptocurrency/,"The hedge fund legend Paul Tudor Jones sent shockwaves through the investment world on Thursday, with the announcement that he’s buying Bitcoin futures.

Jones is among the first major hedge fund managers to make a strong case for the leading cryptocurrency.

His investment thesis takes a deep dive into why BTC may emerge as a leading hedge against the inflation that Jones believes will follow the rapid increase in money-printing from central banks.

“Just since February, a global total of $3.9 trillion (6.6% of global GDP) has been magically created through quantitative easing. We are witnessing the Great Monetary Inflation (GMI) — an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen…

Quite often, how the markets respond will be at odds with your priors. But remember, the P&L always wins in the long run. With that in mind, in a world that craves new safe assets, there may be a growing role for Bitcoin.”

Jones is careful to point out that he’s not exactly the usual demographic of the average cryptocurrency investor.

Rather, he’s looking to take a practical approach to analyzing its potential to be a store of value similar to gold.

“Truth in advertising, I am not a hard-money nor a crypto nut. I am not a millennial investing in cryptocurrency, which is very popular in that generation, but a baby boomer who wants to capture the opportunity set while protecting my capital in ever-changing environments. One way to do that is to make sure I am invested in the instruments that respond first to the massive increases in global money…

At the end of the day, the best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse. Just own the best performer and not get wed to an intellectual side that might leave you weeping in the performance dust because you thought you were smarter than the market. If I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be Bitcoin.”

Jones also points to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins as a singular feature that makes the leading cryptocurrency stand out among all other assets.

And the number one reason he’s bullish on Bitcoin is because the digitization of currency has officially arrived, with Bitcoin well-positioned to capitalize on the global shift spurred by the coronavirus.

“The most compelling argument for owning Bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19…

The probable introduction of Facebook’s Libra (whose value will be pegged to the US dollar and will not be a store of value in that sense) as well as China’s DCEP, also tied to the yuan, will make virtual digital wallets a commonplace tool for the world. It will make the understanding, utility, and ease of ownership of Bitcoin a much more commonplace option than it is today.”

On May 6, 2020, the company notably announced the purchased 1,040 Antminer S19s from Chinese manufacturer Bitmain.

The new crypto mining equipment cost the company $1.9 million, after Riot’s purchase of 1,000 S19s Pros (confirmed on April 30, 2020).

Riot Blockchain plans to receive and install the new digital currency miners during Q3 2020. The company said it expects that the 2,040 S19s will boost its operational hashrate by as much as 80% by next year.

Riot claims that it should have an operating hashrate of 457 petahashes per second. The firm expects to utilize around 16.5 megawatts of electricity once the equipment has been installed and starts running.

A Bitmain representative from North America said the company had been working cooperatively with the Riot Blockchain team for the past few years. The representative added that Riot has been using Bitmain’s Antminer products at its data centers.

Riot’s large purchase from Bitmain has been finalized at a time when there have been reports of issues with the mining giant’s recently shipped batch of S17s cryptocurrency miners. Failure rates have been around 30%, according to reports from several miners.

The firm says it’s in the process of negotiating terms with clients who may have bought defective mining equipment.

Riot Blockchain’s management revealed that its operations have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company said it has moved some of its recently acquired S17 crypto miners to a separate center managed by mining service provider, Coimint (in New York).

A New Jersey judge recently granted seven motions of dismissal, which ended a lengthy lawsuit filed against Riot Blockchain. The suit had alleged that the company may have misled its investors back in 2018.",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-markets-growing-up,"When Paul Tudor Jones II says he’s long bitcoin, investors pay attention. Even if they don’t agree with his stance, he’s a well-known hedge fund investor, one of the great commodity inventors of all time, an iconic name in the “smart money” set. Most investors tend to follow the “smart money” – perhaps not right away, but the external validation from someone paid to be skeptical of hype will most likely act as a trigger for many. On the whole, investors tend to move as a herd.

Even more interesting are the reasons given: According to reports, he is buying bitcoin “as a hedge.” This is very different from funds speculating on bitcoin’s price going up. This is a hedge position, which is more fundamental and long-term.

It also indicates an understanding of bitcoin’s value proposition. Crypto investors got excited when it was revealed a few weeks ago that Renaissance Technologies was contemplating trading bitcoin futures. Reniassance’s Medallion fund is a quant fund, interested in discrepancies in volatilities and other relatively obscure metrics. It doesn’t really care about the underlying asset. Tudor Investment Corp., however, has studied bitcoin enough to understand its monetary properties and technological resilience.

This isn’t an institutional investor pontificating about the need for real assets in the face of unlimited money issuance and economic strain. This is hedge fund royalty publicly acknowledging that he is betting on bitcoin as a hedge. This is different.

Coming of age

Back in 2015, in what feels like a lifetime ago but is only slightly more than the average age of your standard laptop, I read an article in CoinDesk about a conference held in Hong Kong. It featured a photo of a panel session that had generated a lot of excitement. For the first time, approximately 90% of Bitcoin mining hashpower (the computational capacity of network processing) was on the same stage. To many of us back then, Bitcoin mining had the allure of secrecy and power – it was the motor of the industry, and yet we knew so little about it: the who, the where, the with what.

Fast forward to today, and bitcoin mining is still dominated by large mining pools based in China. But the sector has changed so much.

First, the balance is shifting, with the growth of mining business in Europe, North America and elsewhere. Earlier this week, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance launched an interactive chart of hashpower distribution, which shows a notable drop in China’s concentration. (Tune in to our show on Consensus: Distributed TV tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. ET to hear Christine Kim talk to some of the principals leading this shift).

Second, the sector is much less secretive. A few days ago, mining pool Poolin released a report with detailed information on hashrate distribution and the energy costs of different machines, an unusual trove of information from a key industry operator.

Miners appear to be more willing to talk: my CoinDesk Research colleague Christine Kim hosted a series of podcasts talking to miners about their businesses, and many contributed comments to our Bitcoin Halving Report. There are even miner-centric newsletters and podcasts.

What’s more, some key miners are now listed companies, complying with the requisite disclosures which lend insight into how mining businesses are run.

There is also a notable shift in the style and profile of bitcoin miners, towards more sophisticated structures and financial engineering. I’ve written before about how bitcoin markets are growing up. Bitcoin mining is, too.

Some leading derivatives exchanges are offering increasingly flexible products. Rather than the quarterly maturities most common in traditional options, bitcoin options are now available for a range of settlement dates, which gives producers more flexibility.

Going even further, some infrastructure participants are designing tools specifically for miners. Late last year, crypto liquidity provider GSR announced a partnership to develop a “tailored risk management solution.” Some lenders have talked about structuring collateralized loans specifically for miners.

And earlier this week, crypto data provider Coin Metrics unveiled a new type of hashrate index, which could remove some of the subjectivity of the traditional hashrate measure and serve as a basis for hashrate derivatives, allowing miners to hedge one of their main sources of uncertainty.

Outside of financial products, the business itself becoming more investable. Cloud mining removes the need to deal with hardware issues, and some unrelated businesses are entering the mining game.

With all this going on, it’s not hard to see why the third Bitcoin halving (in which the number of bitcoins issued to miners for their processing work gets halved), expected tomorrow, is so different from the previous two.

The sector’s resilience no longer lies at the mercy of bitcoin issuance and market price. These are significant, yes, but there is a growing array of tools to mitigate their impact, and the profile of the participants in the mining industry is becoming more diverse. This adds resilience.

The financialization of mining may dilute some of the original ethos of bitcoin as a decentralized, hard form of money; but the flexibility and relative stability it could add should make the market more resistant to protocol adjustments and price swings.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

U.S. job losses announced this week broke all records (20.5 million for April, 10 times the previous record decline in 1945), but that didn’t stop the S&P’s perplexing rise, which makes me wonder where investors think the earnings boost will come from. It’s not like companies will be buying back their own shares in bulk in this environment. Maybe the market thinks the Fed will start buying shares?

Also disconcerting are indications that the futures market is pricing in negative rates. But is that enough to spook the market? Not yet. Momentum investing seems to be the ruling strategy.

Speaking of momentum, bitcoin breaking $10,000 did not attract the fanfare it would have a few weeks ago. Just as well, since it was fleeting. (The chart below was compiled before an almost 20% drop, to just over $8,200 at time of writing on Sunday evening.)

Chain links

Crypto asset manager Bitwise has published a report that shows even a small allocation of bitcoin to multi-asset portfolios would have boosted cumulative returns, even if it was bought at the December 2017 high and rebalanced. TAKEAWAY: The advantages of a low correlation.

Given the hype around the potential price impact of the upcoming bitcoin block subsidy halving, many believe the price will continue to go up afterwards. History shows that is not necessarily the case. TAKEAWAY: One of the reasons could be profit taking (“buy the rumor, sell the news”). Another could be an uptick in selling pressure as miners liquidate inventory to compensate the cut in income. Some investors probably fear weakened network resilience as a sell-off could push even more miners out of the market. Tomorrow’s halving has the added overlay of heightened general market risk. So, the bitcoin price might continue its upward trend post-halving … or, it might see a correction.

Source: Coin Metrics

Crypto data site Coin Metrics has created a hashrate index, intended to serve as the base for derivative products that could help miners and investors hedge their positions. TAKEAWAY: Miners can control their own hashrate, but they have no way of knowing how much of the total processing power of the sector their share accounts for – the hashrate index is based on an estimate derived from the time it takes to mine recent blocks. The new “observed work” metric aims to remove some of the subjectivity around hashrate observations, and could form the basis of hashrate derivatives. As I stressed in THE BRIEFING above, the crypto mining sector is maturing at a breathtaking pace. Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have reached their highest level since the summer of 2019. TAKEAWAY: This is likely due to the strong growth in stablecoin transactions and supply – most stablecoins run on Ethereum. It could also be partially due to the impending network shift to proof-of-stake, as the number of addresses holding 32 or more ETH – the minimum required to become a network validator – has increased sharply.

Tether is easily the leader in the stablecoin pack in terms of market cap and growth – yet that growth is not evenly distributed amongst its various forms. Supply on Omni, the first tether blockchain, is declining, while that on Ethereum and Tron is growing fast. TAKEAWAY: This discrepancy shows why it’s important to look into the nuts and bolts of the blockchain on which your stablecoin of choice runs. Omni, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, is more robust than other blockchains, and has multisig capabilities (which allow for more complex transaction configurations). However, it also suffers sudden transaction fee spikes and longer confirmation times. The decline in its use shows what stablecoin characteristics users value more.

Every day, around mid-morning New York time, the average bitcoin transaction fee spikes for up to an hour, then returns to normal. A recent paper claims that this is due to crypto derivative exchange BitMEX’s policy of transmitting thousands of transactions at once, at the same time every day. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin transaction fees are not obligatory, but are usually estimated by wallet software according to the network congestion at the time. Users tend to accept whatever is proposed, since insisting on paying lower fees implies a potentially longer processing wait. What’s interesting here is that exchanges can influence the fees that users pay miners, even without being at all involved in the transaction. Nearly 85% of bitcoin addresses are “in the money,” having accumulated their bitcoin at a lower average price than the current market price. TAKEAWAY: Some investors believe this implies potential selling pressure, as investors start to take profits.

Crypto data provider CryptoCompare has released its April 2020 Exchange Review, which shows that derivatives volumes fell by 25% over the month, while spot volumes were down only 13%. TAKEAWAY: Part of the derivatives decline may be the fallout from the March crash, as high-risk traders retreated to lick their wounds. BitMEX, traditionally the largest crypto derivatives exchange by volume and one of the protagonists behind the Black Thursday slump, has lost its throne, slipping to fourth place, behind Huobi, OKEx and Binance. It seems that network effects aren’t everything when it comes to market infrastructure totem poles. Volumes on most derivative exchanges may be down (see above), but open interest on the CME is at an all-time high. TAKEAWAY: The CME’s volume is negligible in comparison to offshore exchanges such as OKEx and Binance, but it is the derivatives platform that regulated U.S.-based financial institutions must use. Renaissance Technologies recently disclosed that it was contemplating trading crypto derivatives on the CME; and Paul Tudor Jones’ revelation earlier this week has led many to speculate he’s behind a large part of the open interest growth. Whoever is accumulating positions, the OI growth on the CME is a sign that institutions are coming back into the market after the risk-averse retreat following Black Thursday in March. And the fact that the OI growth is outstripping volume growth shows that these accumulators are not short-term traders.

The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance has launched a new interactive Bitcoin mining map, which visualizes the average monthly share of Bitcoin’s hashrate by country for the first time, and provides an exclusive visualisation of China’s hashrate distribution at the provincial level. TAKEAWAY: China has 65% of bitcoin hashrate. This is lower than in the past, and is likely to continue to shift as hardware technology advances and business models become more financialized. My colleague Christine Kim is hosting a talk on Monday, May 11 as part of our Crypto Long & Short show at Consensus: Distributed, in which she’ll be speaking to representatives from some of the large North American crypto mining groups that are emerging.

Digital Assets Research has produced a review of notable institutional interest in blockchain projects and crypto assets. TAKEAWAY: This was a fun read, I confess I’d lost sight of many of these projects. The report shows that, while the initial hype has been subdued under a barrage of delays and corporate shifts, there is still a significant amount of work going on in so many different areas of capital markets. Even if most of the projects do not end up in production, this will further our collective knowledge of the limitations and the potential.

Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade has granted a cryptocurrency mining license to Turkey-based iMiner, which plans to operate up to 6,000 mining rigs in the city of Semnan. TAKEAWAY: Without going into the utility of the potential use case in nations hit by sanctions and the punitive effect on individuals and businesses of a lack of dollars, one aspect investors should keep an eye on is broadening adoption. This is an example, and given Iran’s famously low average energy cost, could end up becoming a robust industry in the country. (Also, keep an eye out for Leigh Cuen’s series looking at cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets.)

Crypto exchange Bitfinex has launched a derivative (BTCDOM) that allows investors to take a position on bitcoin’s overall share of the cryptocurrency market. TAKEAWAY: The relatively light oversight on some offshore exchanges allows for rapid creativity when it comes to crypto derivative products. Greater choice for investors and traders is not a bad thing, if the risks are identified and monitored.

Swiss fintech firm Amun has launched a daily inverse token, BTCSHORT (BTCS), which returns gains based on inverse price movements of bitcoin in a given 24-hour period. The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January. TAKEAWAY: Hedging has long been a part of advanced crypto portfolios, the emergence of tokens such as these should make more sophisticated portfolio structures available to a wider audience, as they don’t require complicated margin provisioning, and they can be used for hedging but also as a speculation tool.",2020-05-11 00:47:45+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/croatia-bitcoin-fund-hanfa-griffon-regulator,"Croatia’s financial supervisor Hanfa approved a bitcoin investment fund on Thursday, clearing the way for the first regulated, crypto alternative asset fund in the Balkan state.

Hanfa’s board of directors backed Griffon Asset Management’s plan to establish and manage the Passive Digital Asset fund. In the same decision, Hanfa also approved Croatian state-owned bank HPB to serve as the depository.

However, the sharp fall in price did not attract further selling, which suggests that traders are not panicking and dumping their positions. This indicates that the sentiment is to continue buying on the dips.

When Bitcoin plummets, it drags most cryptocurrencies along with it, but it is also important to remember that several major cryptocurrencies have been in an uptrend for the past few weeks.

Corrections in an uptrend offer a buying opportunity to the traders who had missed the bus earlier. With the Bitcoin halving less than two days away, volatility is likely to remain high. Therefore, in the next few days, traders might consider reducing their position size to keep their risk under control.

Let’s see which five major cryptocurrencies offer attractive trading opportunities in the short-term.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $9,200 on May 7 and hit a high of $10,058.52 on the same day. However, the $10,000 level proved to be a tough hurdle to cross.

BTC-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

After a minor correction on May 8 and 9, the BTC/USD pair plummeted on Saturday evening. The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the previous resistance turned support at $9,200 could have led to selling by the bulls and initiation of short positions by the bears.

The pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel where the price moves between the support line and the resistance line of the channel.

$10,000 was close to the resistance line of the channel and from there the pair fell to $8,130.58, which is just above the support line of the channel. The strong bounce off this level, as seen from a long tail on the downside, is a positive sign.

This suggests that the bulls did not panic but used the drop to the support line of the channel to buy. As long as the price remains inside the channel, the trend remains up and strong declines to the support line of the channel can be purchased.

The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the channel. If that happens, long positions should be avoided until a new buy setup forms once again.

BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows that the price dropped sharply within a short time frame (shown via the blue arrow on the chart). If the traders watch the 30-minute chart, they can see that the pair dropped from $9,566.52 to $8,130.58 within 30 minutes. Such a fall usually suggests liquidation by a large player.

However, a positive is that the price recovered sharply from $8,130.58 and since then has been trading above the $8,500 levels. The recovery might face stiff resistance between $8,960.97 and $9,156.94, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of this leg of the fall.

If the pair bounces off $8,500, it could be a good entry point for the traders with a stop-loss placed just below the channel. The target objective on the upside is $9,600 and then $10,000.

Conversely, if the next drop breaks below $8,500, traders can wait for the price to bounce off the support line of the channel, which can offer another buying opportunity with stops placed just below the channel.

If the bears sink the price below the channel, it will be a huge negative as it will signal a possible change in trend. Therefore, bottom fishing should be avoided if the pair sustains below the channel.

ETH/USD

Although Ether (ETH) broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on April 29 and 30, the bulls failed to sustain the higher levels. That resulted in a correction, which found support at the 20-day simple moving average ($204) on May 7.

ETH-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

However, today, the 2nd-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turned down sharply and plunged below both moving averages and the support line of the ascending channel.

Due to this, the 10-day exponential moving average ($203) has turned down marginally and the relative strength index has slipped into the negative territory. This suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. The price should sustain below the channel to confirm a change in trend.

Currently, the price has bounced off the support line of the ascending channel, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls view the dips as a buying opportunity. The pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above the downtrend line.

ETH-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The ETH/USD pair is attempting to reverse direction from the support line of the ascending channel. However, the bears are defending the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the decline, which is at $193.946.

If the price turns down and plummets below $181.40, it will signal weakness and could result in a decline to $167 and below it to $150. Therefore, traders can initiate short positions below $181 with stops placed just above $194.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the support line of the channel, it will signal buying on dips. Therefore, the bulls can buy the bounce off the channel with the stops placed at $181. If the bulls push the price above $197.821-$201.696 resistance, a rally to the downtrend line is possible.

As the markets are volatile, traders should keep trailing their stops higher to reduce their risk.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the trend is up. However, the bears have been aggressively defending the $3 levels for the past few days. Although the bulls broke above this level on April 29 and 30, they could not build up on the breakout.

XTZ-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

On May 9, the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turned around from just below $3 levels. The selling intensified today as the price slipped below the strong support of $2.55.

Although the bears broke below the support line of the channel, they could not sustain the price below the channel. The long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support line of the channel.

The 10-day EMA ($2.72) has turned flat and the RSI has dipped to just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the bulls can keep the price above $2.55, it could offer a buying opportunity.

XTZ-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The XTZ/USD pair is likely to face resistance in the $2.6015-$2.0686 zone, which corresponds to the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent leg of the fall.

If the price turns down from this resistance zone, a fall to $2.50 and below it to the support line of the channel is possible. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. If the price bounces off the zone, it could offer a buying opportunity to the traders.

The stops for this trade can be kept just below $2.20. On the upside, a rally to $2.70 and then to $3 is possible. The traders can trail the stops higher as the price moves up.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the next dip breaks below the support line of the channel and sustains below $2.240. If this level cracks, long positions can be avoided until a new buy setup forms.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) has been facing stiff resistance at the overhead resistance at $0.0522712 while the bulls have been buying the dips to the support at $0.0468137. This tight range trading suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.

ADA-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The 13th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap plunged to a low of $0.0427299 today but the sharp recovery from the lows shows aggressive buying by the bulls. If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.0468137, it could offer a buying opportunity.

Conversely, if the price again slips back below $0.0468137, it will signal weakness. Below this level, a retest of $0.0427299 is possible. If this support also cracks, a deeper correction will be on the cards.

ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour of the ADA/USD pair shows that the price is stuck in a $0.0543484-$0.0461143 range. Though the price dipped below this range, the bulls could not sustain the lower levels. This resulted in a sharp pullback, which shows strong buying on dips.

However, the recovery is facing resistance in the $0.0477515-$0.0489368 zone, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent fall.

If the bulls buy the next fall to the $0.0468137-$0.0461143 support zone, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Therefore, traders can buy the bounce off this zone with a target objective of $0.053.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.0461143. If that happens, a deeper fall is likely, hence, traders can avoid bottom fishing below this level until a new buy setup forms.

NEO/USD

NEO has been trading inside the ascending channel for the past few weeks. Though the bulls broke above the resistance line of the channel on May 8, they could not sustain the breakout.

NEO-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

As a result, the 20th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap again dipped back into the channel. However, with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls.

Today, the bulls purchased the dip to the 10-day EMA ($9.8), which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to enter long positions. The trend will remain positive as long as the price remains inside the channel.

The first sign of weakness will be if the bears sink the price into the bottom half of the channel. A break below the support line of the channel will signal a change in trend.

NEO-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows that the failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the resistance line of the channel attracted profit booking. That dragged the price to just below the centerline of the channel.

However, strong buying close to $9.64 levels has pushed the NEO/USD pair back into the top half of the channel. This is a positive sign. If the bulls can scale the price above $10.50, a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $11.30 is possible Therefore, traders can buy at $10.50 with a stop-loss below $9.60.

On the other hand, if the pair dips below $9.63378, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A bounce of this level can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity.

In this case, the stop-loss can be kept just below the channel because if the price sustains below the channel, a deeper correction is likely.

Now what?

At the time it took place (19:23 UTC or 3:30 p.m. ET), bitcoin was trading below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, bearish technical indicators after a huge 10% drop in price on May 10 at 00:00 UTC. This was triggered by an outage striking San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase. At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading down less than a percent over 24 hours at $8,677.

The bitcoin halving, which reduced the new supply of bitcoin generated by cryptocurrency miners from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block (a reduction from roughly 1,800 BTC down to 900 BTC per day), arrived amid economic unpredictability due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The international scenario is quite different than in 2016, and bitcoin has never been tested during a global economic crisis. So we can expect anything to happen,” said Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentina-based cryptocurrency exchange Ripio.

Traders are anticipating unpredictability in bitcoin’s price for the short term, and therefore volatility is expected, says Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairfield Strategies. “We don’t have a big sample size of past halvings, but they generally have a positive impact on sentiment after a short-term period of volatility.”

“I think the anticipation of the halving has contributed to the outperformance by bitcoin over the past few weeks, and that a breakout greater than $10,055 is likely to unfold after a few weeks of choppiness triggered by today’s gap,” Stockton added.

Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, wrote in his daily note that the halving may not mean much immediately, but agrees this event will be a meaningful one over a long time horizon. “It is likely to have an impact in the price over the long term, as the reduced daily issuance makes the asset more scarce,” Greenspan wrote.

“Bitcoin mining pools have actually been accumulating ahead of the halving,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at analytics firm Chainalysis, said Monday on a CoinDesk Consensus:Distributed panel. “Because of the halving, we could have a bit of a liquidity crunch.”

Despite higher volumes on Coinbase prior to bitcoin’s halving, it doesn’t mean volume will continue to rise in the short term, said Christopher Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “I think we’re now in the zone where no significant retail money will come in this week and I think we’ll trade between $8,000-$9,000 for the next week or so, with a reasonable possibility of a drop to $7,300.”

At press time, mining hashpower has yet to see a significant drop. Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, is taking a wait-and-see approach. “Until we see a stabilization in mining activity, for which I’d like to see the proof in the pudding, I’m in no hurry to be buying bitcoin.”

Besides looking at how miners prepared for the event, Shah is also keeping an eye on what the miners will do next, including keeping track of how much mining power will now need to be shut off, and how much selling will happen over the next month. Thus, miner incentives are important. “My view has been that reduced rewards are likely to impact miner incentives more than the pedestrian speculator,” he added.

So-called bitcoin miners expend tremendous amounts of computing power to verify transactions and link them, digitally into a block, hence the term blockchain. Miners on the blockchain — the digital ledger technology that underpins the currency — receive a precise number of bitcoins for their efforts in solving a complex puzzle.

That computing effort is at the very heart of the digital currency that was created 11 years ago by a person, or persons, identifying themselves as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Interest in the event from average folks has been rising measured by search traffic on Google:

What will the reward for bitcoin miners be?

This halving will bring the reward to 6.25 bitcoins.

Originally, those mining for bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.30% were rewarded with 50 coins every 10 minutes, but that reward was cut in half to 25 bitcoins in 2012 and to 12.5 in 2016.

When will the halving occur?

The third halving for bitcoin was expected to occur between May 11 and May 12, with some sites pointing to halvings taking place in about four hours, as of midday Monday in New York.

What impact will the halving have on price?

The halving phenomenon, which was written by Satoshi into the software protocol of bitcoin from its genesis, is intended to constrict supply of the digital asset. No more bitcoins will be created after the total number of bitcoin in existence hits 21 million. Currently, there are 18.4 million bitcoins in circulation, according to data site CoinMarketCap.

Tightening supply in bitcoin creates a level of scarcity that in theory should push prices higher, experts in the industry say, who point to past halving events as eventually creating a price floor for bitcoin.

However, CoinDesk reported that options trading in bitcoin showed a 3% chance of a move toward its December 2017 record high at around $20,000, by the end of June, and a 6% chance of a move to record by the end of September.

Currently, bitcoin’s price is $8,954.27, up by about 3%, according to Coindesk.com. Bitcoin prices are up nearly 25% over the past 30-day period, but down 12.5% over the past three months, according to MarketWatch data.

Futures for bitcoin traded on CME Group Inc., were lower on the day by at least 10%, as gauged by the most-active May contract US:BTCK20, which expires May 29. It was trading at $8,955.

Bitcoin is up 24% in the year to date as are bitcoin futures. By comparison, gold prices GC00, -0.14% , the asset bitcoin is often compared against, was up 11.5% in the year to date based on the most active contract on Comex. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.18% was down 15.3% so far this year, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% was off 9.5% over the same period and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.23% was holding on to a 2.2% advance thus far in the year.

What are bitcoin analysts saying?

“What remains clear is that this halving has many more eyes on it than in previous cycles,” in 2012 and 2016, wrote Charles Hayter, co-founder and chief executive at research site CryptoCompare. ‘Search data indicates unprecedented interest in the event and Bitcoin’s blockchain data shows it to be in good health,” he said.

Hayter said that he was viewing the bitcoin halving at this point as “significant,” given the growing worries about the outsize measures of monetary and fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to help limit the damage from lockdown measures in place to slow the spread of COVID-19.

“We are already starting to see flashes of the oncoming depression and rise in isolationism.” he told MarketWatch. “The next phase of emerging market unrest will be an Arab Ppring phase 2 and nonstate issued value transfer mechanisms with censorship resistance will prove their worth for some,” he said.

Bitcoin emerged in the 2007-09 financial crisis.",2020-05-11 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-crypto-traders-predict-bitcoin-price-direction-after-btc-halving,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been showing extreme levels of volatility as it consolidates under a key level of $10,000. The price dropped to as low as $8,100 on May 11, merely a day before the highly anticipated mining reward’s halving.

Following the 20% drop, traders remain divided on where the Bitcoin price would go next, with some traders believing that BTC could immediately see an upsurge to the $14,000 to $15,000 resistance area.

Historically, when Bitcoin’s price saw an extended rally, it went past key resistance levels with ease. For instance, it took BTC 28 days to increase from $8,000 to $20,000 in December 2017. In June 2018, Bitcoin’s price rose from $7,500 to $14,000 in just three weeks. So, BTC’s price has the tendency to increase by a large margin in a short period of time, especially when met with huge demand from retail investors.

However, other traders foresee Bitcoin’s price testing lower support levels after its fall to $8,100. Given that Bitcoin fell post-halving in the last two halvings, technical analysts expect BTC to retest the mid-$6,000 region at the lowest.

Bullish scenario for Bitcoin post-halving

The primary bullish scenario following Bitcoin’s block reward halving is a breakout of a major trendline above the $14,000 mark, which dates back to 2017. In the past year, Bitcoin’s price moved within a large multi-year cycle established by its record high at $20,000 and its June 2019 peak at $14,000. Every time Bitcoin’s price got close to breaking out of the range, it was met with a fierce rejection.

If the current Bitcoin momentum is overwhelmingly strong and breaks out of the multi-year trend, there is a possibility that it will trigger a major uptrend. Cryptocurrency trader Satoshi Flipper said:

“I’m still betting on breaking through the upper trend line resistance and price action heading north. No way are my convictions changing because some clowns sold their BTC and price tanked 1 day.”

A Bitcoin technical analyst known as “Galaxy” echoed a similar prediction, saying that the last time BTC saw seven consecutive weekly candles, a 160% increase followed. In the last seven weeks, Bitcoin’s price continued to increase without major pullbacks, which last happened in December 2018. Following the seven weeks, the price surged from $3,100 to $14,000 in only seven months by June 2019. Galaxy said:

“Look what happened the last time we had 7 consecutive green weekly candles. We had a ‘doji’ candle, followed by a 160% increase. By the looks of it, we’re in for a ride.”

Bitcoin’s optimistic medium- to long-term trend based on fractals and technical indicators is further fueled by the entrance of high profile investors into the cryptocurrency market. In an interview with CNBC, billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said that the trust in Bitcoin will increase as time passes. He emphasized that the asset is merely 11 years old and that it is in an early phase of growth. Jones said:

“When it comes to trustworthiness, Bitcoin is 11 years old. There is very little trust in it. We are watching the birth of a store of value. Whether that succeeds or not, only time will tell. What I do know is that every day that goes by and Bitcoin survives, the trust in it will go up.”

Given the influence of Jones in the financial market, there is a possibility that other institutional investors may follow his lead to invest in Bitcoin. Grayscale already recorded more than $380 million in institutional investments in the first quarter of 2020, which supplements the bullish scenario of Bitcoin after the halving.

The bearish scenario for BTC in the short term

In the short-term, several cryptocurrency traders anticipate Bitcoin’s price to drop to as low as $6,500. There are strong arguments to be made for a temporary bearish price trend after the halving. A confluence of Bitcoin nearing a major overhead resistance at $10,500 and historical data suggest a steep fall following a halving.

According to Bitcoin trader “Dave the Wave,” if the price of BTC continues to move based on a fractal taken from 2019, it is likely to see a pullback to the $6,000 region:

“If the fractals continue to hold, time to start thinking about consolidation levels. 50% consolidation in real terms would put BTC in the 6K range. All good for going forward.”

$6,400 is a key pivotal point for BTC’s price. Source: Dave the Wave

The mid-$6,000 area in between $6,400 and $6,600 also carries significant historical importance. In the third quarter of 2019, Bitcoin’s price dropped from $10,500 to $6,410. It consolidated in the $6,000 range for four weeks before breaking out to $10,500 once again in February 2020.

A drop to $6,400 would solidify the mid-$6,000 support area, strengthening the Bitcoin rally for a more robust extended uptrend in the second half of 2020. A cryptocurrency trader known as “Wolf” raised a similar concern. Bitcoin’s price has moved within an ascending triangle pattern since its abrupt recovery from $3,600 on March 12.

The sudden price drop to $8,100 on May 10 led the formation to break, technically leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to a severe correction. At the time, cryptocurrency investor Scott Melker said that the market observed a strong shakeout. Melker added:

“That was the highest hourly volume candle since the epic crypto doom fest on March 12th. I won’t be rushing into a position until this shakes out a bit. That was some real deal selling we just witnessed.”

A pullback from the $10,000 level would provide some stability into the market after a 160% rally within a two-month span. Bitcoin’s price rose by nearly threefold with barely any corrections that left technical analysts worried about the sustainability of the upsurge.

Possible variables that may affect the short-term price trend of BTC

In the short-term, Bitcoin’s price faces two major variables: a sudden inflow of capital from institutional investors and capitulation from small miners. Considering that institutional investors allocated hundreds of millions of dollars into Bitcoin during the first three months of the year, the probability of a larger amount of capital entering the market after the halving is high.

Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale, said in a tweet that his investment firm reached $3.7 billion in assets under management on May 9, an all-time high for the company. Grayscale said in its Q1 report:

“Hedge Fund Investment Gains Steam: 88% of inflows this quarter came from institutional investors, the overwhelming majority of which were hedge funds. The mandate and strategic focus of these funds is broadly mixed and includes Multi-Strat, Global Macro, Arbitrage, Long/Short Equity, Event Driven, and Crypto-focused funds.”

In contrast, a variable that may cause a Bitcoin downtrend in the near-term is the possibility of capitulation by small and overleveraged miners. After the halving, the breakeven cost of mining will hover between $12,500 and $15,000, depending on the difficulty of the mining as the TradeBlock report explained at the start of 2020.

While the cost of mining Bitcoin is likely to be lower than most estimates, even at the lowest forecast of $12,525, miners will be operating at a loss for at least several months. The relatively low price of Bitcoin opens BTC up for a miner capitulation, forcing small miners to sell BTC. Digital asset manager Charles Edwards tweeted:

“This will be the most brutal Bitcoin Halving in history. Production cost is about to double to $14,000. 70% above the current price. Last halving, price was just 10% below Production cost, and Price & HR collapsed -20%. Without FOMO now, expect a big miner capitulation. 30%+”

Both variables are not likely to affect Bitcoin’s price in a meaningful way in the immediate-term, as they represent extreme scenarios. BTC is now at a critical juncture that may decide its price trend over the next 12 months, and generally, traders remain long-term optimistic about the price trend of BTC.",,https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/the-fastest-horse-billionaire-who-predicted-1987-crash-is-betting-on-bitcoin/,"The legendary macro investor's Bitcoin bet was widely covered in the mainstream media just as the BTC halving may kick off a bull run (Photo: CNBC)

He’s widely regarded as one of the best macroeconomic traders of his generation. Now, in an announcement that could send shockwaves through Wall Street—and one that’s already making a splash in the financial press—Paul Tudor Jones says he is betting on Bitcoin to be the best-performing asset of the decade.

Even more importantly, he’s jumping into the main cryptocurrency in a big way. In a May 11 interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Jones said he has, “just over 1% of my assets in bitcoin. Maybe it’s almost 2. That seems like the right number right now.”

Tudor Investment Corp.’s flagship BVI fund has $22 billion, making Jones’ investment close to $440 million. It comes at a particularly opportune moment, as today’s Bitcoin halving attracts a lot of attention, and suggests the price of BTC is about to begin a long bull run.

When asked why he changed his mind about Bitcoin, Jones said that COVID-19 pandemic and the printing of vast amounts of fiat currency made him rethink how he wanted his portfolio positioned going forward.

“The digitization of the world clearly benefits Bitcoin,” Jones said. “Bitcoin will be that much more accessible by people that could own it as a store of value.”

A significant intervention

Jones has a carefully cultivated reputation and a strong track record—famously establishing a name for himself by predicting the 1981 Black Thursday crash, with his fund delivering net gains of 125.9% per cent by shorting stocks on Wall Street.

Because of this track record, he’s listened to. His endorsement of Bitcoin could trigger substantial inflows into the market. It comes amid rising levels of institutional investor interest in the asset.

“Paul Tudor Jones just removed career risk from investing in Bitcoin,” tweeted BitMEX CEO and co-founder Arthur Hayes on May 7. “Expect a lot of beta fund managers to begin cooking some copy pasta.”

Gemini cryptocurrency exchange CEO Tyler Winklevoss agreed, tweeting “Wall Street is coming.”

Betting on Bitcoin

Jones has dabbled in cryptocurrency before, “for fun” as he describes it, around the time BTC hit all-time highs in 2017. He managed to double his money by exiting near the top. Fast forward two-and-a-half years, and Jones says he is revisiting Bitcoin as an investable asset—arguing it can compete with gold, stocks, art, and land.

In his latest macro economic outlook, Tudor wrote: “The question facing every investor is, ‘What will be the winner in ten years’ time?’”

“At the end of the day, the best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse. Just own the best performer and not get wed to an intellectual side that might leave you weeping in the performance dust because you thought you were smarter than the market. If I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be Bitcoin.”

Jones conceded that he may not be the target market for BTC, or at least the type of person who tends to invest in it, but said this doesn’t matter: “I am not a hard-money nor a crypto nut. I am not a millennial investing in cryptocurrency, which is very popular in that generation, but a baby-boomer who wants to capture the opportunity set while protecting my capital in ever-changing environments.”

“A great speculation”

Jones only revealed his Bitcoin investment on May 7, also on CNBC. In that interview, Jones went further—telling the financial news channel the “birthing of a store of value” could be happening before Wall Street’s own eyes.

He pointed to how, in normal times, central banks have a stated aim of depreciating the value of the fiat currencies they control by 2% a year, effectively meaning that consumers have a “wasted asset on their hands.”

The billionaire also warned this depreciation is set to be exacerbated this year, with trillions of dollars in new money being printed as central banks desperately try to revive their economies. For Bitcoin, government interference is not a concern, he said, with its limited supply of 21 million serving as an effective hedge against inflation.

He acknowledged that at just 11 years old, betting on Bitcoin is still risky, telling “Squawk Box” on Monday: “When I look at Bitcoin I see it as one tiny part of a portfolio. It may end up being the best performing part—I kind of think it might be—but I’m very conservative. It has not been a store of value like gold has for 2,500 years.”

Updated 5:12 p.m. on May 11, 2020 with Tyler Winklevoss tweet.",2020-05-11 20:54:06+00:00,https://www.hedgeweek.com/2020/05/11/285482/crypto-hedge-fund-aum-grows-new-launches-hinge-bitcoin-prices,"Hedge funds trading cryptocurrencies doubled their assets under management last year - but returns remain volatile, with the ability to survive hinging heavily on performance, a new industry survey has found.

The ‘2020 Crypto Hedge Fund Report’, jointly published today by PwC and Elwood Asset Management, a digital assets-focused investment firm, surveyed more than 40 managers running active crypto hedge funds during Q1 2020.

The wide-ranging report – which explores both quantitative issues within the crypto hedge fund sector, including liquidity terms, trading of cryptocurrencies and performance, as well as qualitative themes, such as best practice with respect to custody and governance – indicates a sector gathering momentum, but still subject to volatile and unstable returns.

Research shows there are around 150 active crypto hedge funds, almost two thirds of which launched in the past two years.

The amount of assets under management in cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds grew from USD1 billion in 2018 to more than USD2 billion in 2019.

The percentage of crypto hedge funds running more than USD20 million in assets grew in 2019 from just under a fifth (19 per cent) to more than a third (35 per cent). At the same time, the average AUM double from from USD21.9 million to USD44 million.

The median AUM at fund launch is USD2 million, indicating that funds have generally seen a four-times increase in AUM in 2019.

The report identified four main cryptocurrency hedge fund strategies. Quantitative funds – which include directional, multi-strategy and arbitrage strategies - dominate the crypto hedge fund space, amounting to almost half (48 per cent) of the sector. Discretionary long-only funds account for almost a fifth (19 per cent), followed by discretionary long/short (17 per cent) and multi-strategy (17 per cent).

All generated positive gains last year, with multi-strategy gaining 15 per cent, quant and discretionary long/short up more than 30 per cent, and long-only advancing some 40 per cent on a median basis.

But the sector faces significant survivorship bias, the report found, as the median crypto hedge fund performance rebounded from -46 per cent in 2018 to 74 per cent in 2019.

“This provides very clear evidence that funds that significantly underperformed during the previous year had to shut down,” the report said.

“This is particularly relevant when we consider the small AUM of crypto hedge funds: their average management fees [around 2 per cent and 20 per cent on average] are not enough for them to break even. This can only be achieved with strong performance fees.”

The report added: “While these strategies were able to mitigate the effects of the 2018 crypto bear market, they did not succeed in replicating the upward trend of 2019.”

Most crypto hedge funds trade bitcoin (97 per cent), followed by Ethereum (67 per cent), XRP (38 per cent), Litecoin (38 per cent), bitcoin Cash (31 per cent) and EOS (25 per cent).

Indeed, the study found that crypto fund launches are highly correlated with the price of bitcoin, with the 2018 bitcoin price spike proving a catalyst for more fund launches, while the market slide in late 2019 coincided with a “material decline” in new fund launches.

Almost 90 per cent of all investors are either family offices or high net worth individuals, with few crypto strategies attracting institutional or pension allocations.",2020-05-11 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-com-lands-record-360m-insurance-cover-for-offline-bitcoin-vaults,"Crypto.com has gathered a record-breaking $360 million worth of insurance to cover the potential loss of coins stored in special offline vaults.

Announced Monday, the crypto finance platform accessed the cover through institutional custody provider Ledger Vault, which offers $150 million of pooled insurance cover to clients via insurance broker Marsh, and Lloyd’s of London underwriter Arch Insurance.

Crypto.com, which reports two million users on its platform, has topped up the Ledger Vault cover with a $100 million direct policy, and also availed itself of $110 million worth of digital asset custody insurance from BitGo under a pooled and direct policy.

Snagging crypto insurance has been notoriously difficult over the past few years, even for the large blue-chip exchanges. Things appear to be changing, however, with Lloyd’s, the 300-year-old specialist insurance market, recently putting its name to a product covering losses from so-called “hot wallets,” or accounts that remain connected to the internet.

There has been some rivalry among crypto custodians touting big-figure insurance cover, with Seattle-based exchange Bittrex recently trumpeting some $300 million of cover for cold storage, or offline accounts. Coinbase and Gemini have also announced insurance coverage of $200 million and above to assuage potential concerns of deep-pocketed institutional clients.

‘An arm and a leg’

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the multi-month process of attaining insurance cover was like working with Visa to issue a crypto credit card, which took the startup a year and a half to complete.

“These types of big firms and institutions take their sweet time of course, and boy, oh boy, do they charge an arm and a leg for this,” said Marszalek. “It’s us paying for the big insurance guys’ education in this space. Over time, as the industry gets bigger and maybe some competitors come in, we will have slightly more leverage to negotiate,” he added.

Firms that are part of Ledger Vault’s $150 million insurance program can buy additional coverage on top. This involves more tire-kicking from the team of crypto specialists at Marsh and Arch, one of the few underwriters at Lloyd’s that fully understands cryptocurrency.

“A complete and detailed understanding of the custodial process is one of the most critical, and time-consuming, stages in the underwriting of any digital asset risk,” James Croome, head of specie for Arch Underwriting, told CoinDesk via email.

“By choosing to partner with Ledger Vault, a known service provider to insurers, Crypto.com was not only able to provide underwriters with the necessary confidence in their custodial security, but they were also able to obtain a policy in a much shorter time frame than is ordinarily the case,” said Croome.

Flawed concept?

Crypto.com has taken a multi-vendor approach towards insurance, involving both Ledger Vault and BitGo in its collective cover. Marszalek said this was less to do with amassing a big dollar amount and more about having a regulated presence in different regions and jurisdictions. (BitGo received regulatory approval from the South Dakota Division of Banking to operate as a qualified custodian for storing digital assets, for example.)

Cold-storage cover of the sort Crypto.com has purchased covers loss or destruction of private cryptographic keys by natural disasters like earthquakes and the like, as well as insider theft and collusion among employees. It does not cover remote, third-party hacks; the system must be infiltrated in such a way that the attacker physically accesses the storage medium.

Big players in the exchange space like Binance and Kraken have called out crypto insurance as a flawed concept, taking the view that firms simply have to self-insure at the end of the day.

Marszalek was philosophical about this.",2020-05-11 14:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/vitalik-buterin-says-much-delayed-ethereum-2-0-still-on-track-for-july-launch,"UPDATE (May 12, 23:33 UTC): After this article was published, Buterin said he did not hear the word “July” in the question about Eth 2.0’s progress and misspoke as a result. Read his full statement here.

Vitalik Buterin said the Ethereum 2.0 protocol upgrade, which will change the consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), is well on its way to launching sometime in July.

Kicking off the Consensus: Distributed event Monday, the founder of Ethereum told CoinDesk’s Michael Casey and Zack Seward the testnet for Ethereum 2.0 was already live and the first phases of implementation began about a week ago.

The Ethereum community started talking about replacing its proof-of-work (PoW) system – which is based on “work” done by miners and is also employed by the Bitcoin protocol – with PoS almost as soon as the network launched back in 2015.

Sometimes known as Serenity, Ethereum 2.0 has long been subject to delays. Although originally slated for January 2020, it was pushed back to Q2, and then again to Q3 2020. July has been a target date for developers since the beginning of the year. Many appear to be eyeing a debut for July 30 to coincide with Ethereum’s fifth anniversary.

At Consensus: Distributed, Buterin also said many Ethereum developer teams were busy working on a series of scaling initiatives that could be implemented soon after PoS had successfully launched.

These include well-known techniques like sharding, which effectively divides consensus into small groups to speed up verification times, as well as new scaling solutions currently in testing. One is a layer-2 solution, Optimistic Rollup, that could “theoretically scale to over 1,000 transactions per second,” even in Ethereum’s existing iteration, according to Buterin.

Speaking at Consensus: Distributed earlier on Monday, Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood, who is now the founder of Parity Technologies, criticized his former project for its poor governance structure, which he said makes it next to impossible for Ethereum to act on behalf of the stakeholder community.

The $3 million seed round with Phan and Ashton Kutcher’s VC firm, Sound Ventures, marks roughly $5.4 million in total capital raised by Lolli so far. Pathfinder, the early-stage investment arm of Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, led this recent round with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Craft Ventures and Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.

“We have an incredible syndicate of strategic investors that will help drive the adoption of Lolli and bitcoin forward,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman said in a press statement.

As of this week, Phan’s fans can use Lolli to earn bitcoin rewards when shopping directly on her Em Cosmetics website. Adelman said the funding will be used to launch Lolli’s mobile app this summer and expand the company internationally throughout 2020.

The e-commerce landscape has shifted dramatically since Lolli launched in 2018. In short, people are shopping more online and managing their money through apps. For example, Shopify revenues reportedly jumped 47% in Q1 2020 and Square, a fintech app that also offers bitcoin, is participating in mainstream programs like the U.S. government’s emergency Paycheck Protection Program. This means it’s easier than ever for people to earn and spend a variety of currencies from home.

From Adelman’s perspective, Square’s patent for converting fiat-to-crypto is a “game-changer” for the retail industry.

“It’s arguably the most important patent in the payments space that will affect cryptocurrency over the next 10 years,” Adelman said. “It’s an air-swap where someone can pay with whatever currency they want and also the merchant can accept whatever currency they want.”

This relates to Lolli because the startup’s primary business partners are retailers and merchants looking for shoppers to come directly to homepages instead of Amazon. For example, Em Cosmetics fans can earn bitcoin by shopping on the homepage and learn about it through the brand’s social media channels. People looking to liquidate those earnings can easily do so with mainstream apps like Cash App or Strike, even if they’re not interested in using an exchange account.",2020-05-11 12:00:00+00:00,,,

But for bitcoin, the world's most popular digital currency, the opposite is happening.

The amount of new bitcoins being issued is starting to slow because of a phenomenon known as a halving, or the halvening. Every four years, the amount of new coins that bitcoin investors (or miners, as they are known) receive as a reward for mining a block of bitcoins is cut in half.

Bitcoin prices have surged in the past few weeks in anticipation of the latest halving, which took place on Monday.

As a result, bitcoin miners now receive 6.25 bitcoins instead of 12.5. This is the third time bitcoin has halved in its history. The next halving event will take place sometime in 2024 and will reduce the number of new bitcoins issued to 3.125.

It's all part of the algorithm behind bitcoin, which is designed to limit the total number of bitcoins that will ever be issued to a finite number of 21 million. There are now about 18.3 million in circulation.

""In this time where governments are printing large amounts of money, the rate of new bitcoins will keep going down,"" said Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack, a digital tokens firm. ""But the demand for bitcoins has increased.""

Some investors predicting new all-time highs for bitcoin

Anticipation of the event helped drive bitcoin prices higher in the past few weeks — from a low of around $4,100 in mid-March to just under $10,000 on May 6. But prices have fallen back to about $8,700 now that the halving has actually occurred.

So what's next for bitcoin?

Several experts say bitcoin prices should go much higher — and even top the all-time high of just under $20,000 from late 2017. The logic? Economics 101.

Demand for bitcoin may increase as investors view it as safer than government-backed paper currencies in the time of Covid-19 and extraordinary easing measures from the Fed and other central banks.

""Imagine if OPEC cut production in half overnight. what would happen to the price of oil? It would go up,"" said Zac Prince, CEO and co-founder of BlockFi, a firm that makes loans with cryptocurrencies.

Prince said he thinks bitcoin prices will eventually soar past $20,000 and skyrocket to as high as $40,000 to $100,000 over the next two years.

Legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has also been touting bitcoin lately as a potential hedge against inflation that could be created by central bank stimulus — much like gold.

Crypto investors also point to the fact that bitcoin prices soared in the first few months after previous halvings in 2012 and 2016. That could happen again this year, especially because of what's happening in the global economy.

""This halving is transpiring at a time when governments are enacting unlimited amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus,"" said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director with Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm.

""Bitcoins are now viewed as a safe haven — kind of like digital gold. It's a verifiable scarce asset with predetermined and predictable supply,"" Sonnenshein added.

But has the easy money already been made?

Still, digital currencies are incredibly volatile.

""The halving is a temporal and technical event that has no bearing on bitcoin's long-term value,"" said Adam Traidman, CEO and co-founder of BRD, a digital wallet for cryptocurrencies.

Traidman said he expects bitcoin's price to eventually start rising steadily again but he is not predicting a dramatic increase over the next few months.

Simply put, bitcoin is still too speculative an asset for many investors — and the wild swings in price will limit its attractiveness.

""The problem is that we are looking at the actions of a few speculators,"" said Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of Celsius Network, another crypto lending firm.

He argues that the price of bitcoin could be stuck hovering around $10,000 for a while until the impact of the halving is fully priced into bitcoin. Others agree.

""There was a psychological impact when we approached the halving due to the significant reduction in supply. But the easy money in bitcoin has been made,"" said Gavin Smith, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Panxora.

The volatility may also limit the allure of bitcoin as a viable currency. How can you use something as a form of payment when its price is so unstable? People will be unlikely to try to buy goods at a store (either a physical one or a website) if the value of a bitcoin is changing so rapidly.

""We're jumping the gun when talking about bitcoin as a form of payment,"" said Daniel Polotsky, CEO of CoinFlip, a bitcoin ATM company. ""It's too speculative and unpredictable to be used as currency.""

That's why Polotsky says investors need to treat bitcoin or other digital currencies as a long-term buy-and-hold investment.

""I know a ton of people that got into bitcoin in late 2017 at the peak, and I feel for them,"" Polotsky said. ""But it's a marathon. You need to own bitcoin for decades. A majority of traders will lose money trying to time market moves.""",2020-05-12 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoins-price-is-rising-despite-a-dull-halving,"Bitcoin’s price is starting to make gains after what turned out to be a rather dull halving event. With daily active bitcoin addresses at the highest level since 2018, interest in bitcoin could be heading even higher.

The world’s first cryptocurrency is now trading above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator. This reversal comes after a huge 10% drop in price on May 10 that led to bearish sentiment ahead of the bitcoin halving, which occurred May 11 at 19:23 UTC (3:23 p.m. ET). At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 1% over 24 hours at $8,829.

While the halving was pretty much a non-event for most traders, many are keeping an eye on various bitcoin-related statistics beyond price. Difficulty, which determines how demanding it is for mining machines to mine a bitcoin block, is one example.

“Definitely looking forward to seeing what the next difficulty adjustment is,” post-bitcoin halving, Ethan Vera, CFO of mining company Luxor, said during a Consensus:Distributed session Monday. The next difficulty adjustment, which occurs roughly every two weeks, is due May 19.

Another metric to watch is the number of active bitcoin addresses. On May 11, the number of active addresses on the bitcoin network totaled 943,869 – the highest number since Jan. 28, 2018, according to data from Glassnode. That was during bitcoin’s frothy 2017-2018 bubble, when prices went as high as $19,915 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.

“When you read that the halving is bullish for bitcoin, it has to be taken with a grain of salt,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, a quantitative crypto trading firm. “It may be bullish, but only if interest for bitcoin remains over that long term.”

Those who became interested in bitcoin as a result of its halving might be tempted to stick around if the price increases.

“Just like the price surges in 2017 that really brought bitcoin to the wider consciousness, the halving could again see a new wave of ordinary investors who are not steeped in computer science or technology,” said Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.

Active addresses can’t be attributed to individual holders because exchanges and wallets often generate multiple keys for users. However, all those addresses do mean more activity is occurring on Bitcoin’s network.

Of course, some of that growing interest could have nefarious intent, said Constantin Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital. The rise in active addresses could be due to things other than buying bitcoin, such as “money laundering and the need to obfuscate chain analysis,” he told CoinDesk.

Although it is hard to pin down exactly what all these active addresses are doing, at least some of them have increased trading using more intricate strategies, said ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz. “In 2020, there are more sophisticated institutional traders in the market. They can use futures and options to build complex trades.”

Active addresses can be an indicator of increased usage and interest in bitcoin, but it doesn’t just necessarily mean “number go up,” added Lifchitz. “I don’t expect a straight line up for bitcoin in the days ahead. I don’t see a drastic 30% jump in price.”

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading near the $8,500 mark.

“Life of a crypto guy can be measured by the number of Bitcoin halvings one has witnessed,” said Arjun Vijay, cofounder and COO of Giottus Cryptocurrency Exchange. Further explaining he said that this is the third time it has happened since Bitcoin was launched and for many crypto investors, it might be the first time they are witnessing the having.

Vijay said that halvings have generally been followed by a bull run in the market. “When all the other traditional asset prices are failing, Bitcoin has already been standing tall with 24% price increase since January 2020, and if the trend continues, 2020 can be a great year for Bitcoin mass adoption in India,” he added.

Interestingly, there are only 21 Mn Bitcoins in existence.

JPMorgan is reportedly providing cash-management services to the crypto exchanges and handling dollar-based transactions for their U.S.-based customers. It will process wire transfers, and deposits and withdrawals through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.



'Quite significant news'



Banks have since long been known to remain reluctant to provide services to cryptocurrency firms, including exchanges. Last August, Barclays stopped providing banking services to Coinbase.



JPMorgan's move suggests that traditional finance companies are becoming more comfortable with the cryptocurrency market.



""It's quite significant news in my opinion,"" a banker told The Block. ""There is little business in fees associated with processing wire and ACH payments, I would expect that there are other associated benefits to JPM from any associated banking services, additional collaboration with both of those firms, potential for winning any future IPO or another angle such as JPM coin being offered on either of those platforms.""



The banker added that the whole of Wall Street will notice this news, and it may lead to further doors being opened for crypto firms at other banks.

""In the same way, the Paul Tudor Jones news gives macro hedge funds a justification to look at bitcoin, the largest bank offering crypto exchange services means a lot of credibility for the space.""



Bitcoin 'a fraud'?



JPMorgan's move is particularly interesting since its CEO Jamie Dimon has been a long-time critic of bitcoin. He once called the world's largest cryptocurrency “a fraud.”

JPMorgan, however, has experimented with bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology. The bank operates a blockchain-based payment network called Interbank Information Network, which allows member banks to exchange information related to international payments. Some of the notable banks on the network include Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group, among others.

JPMorgan also operates a stablecoin-like digital token called JPM Coin, which enables instant payment transfers between institutional accounts.



Earlier this year, JPMorgan was also said to be in discussions to merge its blockchain unit Quorum with Ethereum development studio ConsenSys.",,https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-banking-services-crypto-exchanges-coinbase-gemini/577758/,"Dive Brief:

JPMorgan Chase is extending banking services to bitcoin exchanges Coinbase and Gemini — the first time the nation's largest bank has accepted clients from the cryptocurrency industry, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.

The bank will not process bitcoin or other cryptocurrency-based transactions, but will provide cash-management services and handle dollar-based transactions for the exchanges' U.S.-based customers. It will process wire transfers, and deposits and withdrawals through the Automated Clearing House network, the Journal's sources said.

The accounts were approved last month, and transaction processing is just beginning, the publication reported.

Dive Insight:

The deal with Coinbase and Gemini continues JPMorgan's warming trend toward crypto platforms. As recently as 2017, the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, called bitcoin ""a fraud"" and said he would fire ""in a second"" anyone at JPMorgan found to be trading in the digital currency.

""It's not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,"" Dimon said during the Delivering Alpha conference that year. ""It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.

""You can't have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,"" he added, according to The Guardian. ""If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea ... or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars. There may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.""

Dimon, however, has been a booster of blockchain technology, upon which bitcoin is built. JPMorgan Chase last year said it successfully tested JPM Coin, a digital currency meant to speed up payments. The bank also plans to merge its blockchain unit Quorum with the developer ConsenSys, Reuters reported in February. The bank said it wants to use Quorum to issue JPM Coin to settle interbank transfers.

Banks had resisted dealing with coin exchanges for years out of fear of regulator scrutiny or concern that such ties would expose banks to money laundering. Coinbase and Gemini, however, are regulated by multiple bodies.

Coinbase is registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and Gemini obtained a trust charter from New York’s Department of Financial Services in 2015. Both exchanges have gone through the rigors to operate under NYDFS's BitLicense framework and are licensed money transmitters in multiple states.",2020-05-12 09:38:00,https://www.coindesk.com/irs-solicits-contractors-to-help-examine-crypto-traders-tax-returns,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking third-party contractors to help it assess whether certain U.S. taxpayers have properly paid taxes on their crypto holdings.

According to an email posted online by CryptoTrader.Tax and verified by CoinDesk, IRS Assistant Deputy Commissioner John Cardone said the agency is looking for contractors to “assist our Revenue Agents in calculating taxpayers’ gains or losses as a result of their transactions involving virtual currency.” At least one other company in the space, which asked not to be named, also received the email.

“The IRS can confirm the authenticity of the email,” the agency told CoinDesk.

The call for contractors comes as the IRS is paying increasing attention to the crypto space, having issued its first guidance on the matter in years last October and adding a question about digital currency ownership to this year’s return form. Privacy-conscious crypto users are likely to chafe at the idea that the IRS may be hiring outside parties to review their transactions.

“I don’t think people will be pleased about this. However, those who have been accurately reporting their crypto taxes will have nothing to worry about,” said David Kemmerer, CEO of CryptoTrader.Tax, a software platform used for reporting.

Kemmerer emphasized his firm would not be pursuing the contract. “Our dedication is 100% to our users. We have no plans of working with the government in this regard,” he said.

The email was sent from an IRS government domain, and there is a John Cardone with the agency’s Large Business and International division (LB&I), according to the IRS website.

As CoinDesk reported at the time, Cardone led a session at the IRS crypto summit in March 2020. Cardone, who also welcomed the summit’s audience at the beginning of the event, opened his panel by telling audience members the tax collector was looking for specific issues of interest to the industry.

In his email, dated May 12, Cardone said the IRS is starting with “a few single-case contracts as pilots with a goal of publishing a solicitation and request for proposal for a larger multi-case contract.” Companies that participate will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement and consent to a tax compliance check, the email states.

“I wanted to make you aware of our efforts in case your company has any interest in pursuing this type of work,” Cardone wrote.

Cardone could not immediately be reached for comment.

'Hundreds of thousands' of transactions

An attached six-page “Statement of Work” details what, specifically, the IRS is looking for its potential contractors to do.

According to the document, attached in full below, the contractors would have to look at both on-chain and off-chain data; information obtained through API keys, taxpayer submissions and other sources; determine the gains and losses for each taxpayer and note cost basis; track sales and other transactions; and find any inconsistencies in how the taxpayer is reporting their data.

One section, under the “Services to Be Provided” heading, detailed the complexity of calculating an individual’s tax burden when dealing with cryptocurrencies. The document noted a taxpayer could have “hundreds of thousands of digital asset transactions” per year, which could occur on different exchanges and wallets.

“These transactions need to be aggregated, and the assets involved need to be valued, as part of the process of computing gains and losses,” the document said. “Additionally, specialized technology and infrastructure is required to digest, contain and analyze virtual currency data due to unique requirements such as but not limited to decimal place precision, varying field formats and file formats.”

While the document detailed examples of how much data the contractors would have to look at, it does not specify which exchanges or types of taxpayers the contractors would assess.

The contractors who take on the project may also need to “testify at trial as a summary witness explaining the calculations derived from the underlying data,” the document said.

Ramping up

Tuesday’s email is the latest in a series of steps the IRS has taken to more closely oversee the crypto space.

In 2019, the tax collector sent three variations of warning letters to thousands of traders it believed to have misreported their tax liabilities after trading on crypto exchanges.

The letters advised traders to look at the exact date and time they conducted a transaction, diverging from IRS guidance from 2014, which said to apply “the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”

The agency did not update its tax guidance until October 2019, when it published a new FAQ and additional guidance. In the same month, the IRS updated the main form individual U.S. taxpayers use to report their income to include a question about whether they owned cryptocurrencies.

The agency’s lack of detailed guidance has long been a source of frustration for crypto investors, who claim a lot of cryptocurrencies still don’t fall neatly into existing tax laws.",2020-05-13 05:02:12+00:00,,,,,,,,,

At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 2.3% over 24 hours at $9,106. The world’s first cryptocurrency is trading above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, which is a bullish technical indicator, and has been on a steady uptrend since early trading May 13, 00:00 UTC.

The long-anticipated halving was, “a little uneventful,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research. But there has been one bright spot for traders: Bitcoin prices have been going up slowly but surely.

But market uncertainty lingers when it comes to cryptocurrency miners. The reward for miners to generate new bitcoin was cut because of the halving to 6.25 BTC, so the business of running machines to secure the network is much less profitable: “I think some of the miners might be in trouble. They just took a 50% pay cut overnight, with prices remaining where they are,” added Tan.

One mining metric that immediately changed after the halving was miner revenue from fees, which jumped from 4.6% right before the halving to 7% Wednesday, according to data provider Glassnode.

Miners bowing out of the business may change the dynamics of the crypto market, said Alexander Blum, of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm. “The difference is that miners’ new net tokens are now not necessarily the primary driving force of sell pressure into the markets,” he said. “That mantle is likely to be taken on by exchanges that make trading fees and have to sell into the market to cover their business expenses.”

Steady exchange volumes are indicative of the market’s health and whether bitcoin can continue to appreciate post-halving, said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at quantitative crypto trading firm ExoAlpha.

“Increasing the scarcity of an asset tends to make it more valuable over time, but only if there’s still demand for it,” said Lifchitz. Bitcoin’s price appreciation seems to be increasing in a world where, year to date, bitcoin is performing better than some traditional assets, Lifchitz added, and the numbers back him up.

Bitcoin is trouncing the S&P 500 Wednesday, with the index of large-cap stocks down 1.75%. The cryptocurrency is also doing better than gold, which is up less than 1%. For the year to date, bitcoin is up 27%, gold is in the green 13% while the S&P 500 is down 12%.

In the commodities markets, oil is trading flat, up by less than a percent following continued production cuts of crude. “Other oil-producing countries in the Middle East have stated that they will also reduce production.

This relationship falls far short of providing anything approaching a crypto trading desk and is certainly not JPMorgan Chase holding any crypto assets, all it has done is enabled account holders to transfer money to and from these two exchanges. This indicates that JPMorgan Chase is prepared to defend this activity to regulators and clearly represents a major thawing in how major financial institutions view cryptocurrencies.

The seven-day average of the number of unique addresses holding 10,000 ethers or more fell to 1,050 on Tuesday. That’s the lowest level since January 2019, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

The whale addresses are down nearly 6% from the December high of 1,115. The metric represents externally owned accounts, or the ones controlled by private keys, and excludes contract accounts that have their own code and are controlled by the code.

The decline in the number of ether whale addresses is in contrast to the recent rise in the number of bitcoin whale addresses. The seven-day moving average of the number of addresses holding 10,000 bitcoins or more rose to 111 at the end of April, the highest since August 2019.

“Some ETH whales could have moved into BTC in anticipation of potential price appreciation in the top cryptocurrency due to effects of the mining reward halving,” said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets data.

The bullish hype surrounding bitcoin’s third halving, which took place on May 11, was quite strong and the event was extensively discussed by analysts over the past few months. The bullish expectations were reinforced by bitcoin’s quick recovery to $7,000 in just five days following its drop to $3,867 on March 12.

That may have caused some whales to switch to bitcoin from ether ahead of halving. That is further evidenced by the number of large BTC addresses that jumped by 5% in March while those of ether were on a downward trend.

The divergence could continue to widen because bitcoin is used mainly as a value storage vehicle, according to Jason Wu, CEO and co-founder of the Minneapolis-based digital lending and borrowing platform DeFiner.org. As a result, whales are more likely to hold large amounts of bitcoin than ether, whose main purpose is to facilitate, then monetize, the work done on Ethereum.

“Ethereum has a big application layer ecosystem, and a lot of transactions happen to meet people’s daily demand for solutions like DeFi, games, rewards, etc. More and more new addresses will be created to hold ETH,” said Wu.

Another possible reason for the decline in the large ether addresses could be the increased investor interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

“The address owners may have moved a sizable amount of their holdings to smart contracts of various DeFi protocols that support lending, etc. to make more money,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co.

The number of ether locked up in DeFi rose to a record high of 3.23 million in February and currently stands at 2.65 million, up 28% year on year, according defipulse.com. The rapidly growing DeFi space is dominated by Ethereum, and according to defiprime.com, there are 213 listed DeFi projects at press time, of which 199 are built on Ethereum.

Small addresses grow rapidly

The decline in the large addresses is also in stark contrast to the relentless rise in the number of addresses holding 32 or more coins.

Source: Glassnode

The seven-day average of the total address containing 32 ETH or more stood at a record high of 114,625 on Wednesday, a gain of over 4% this year. “The uptick may be attributed to the bullish sentiment around the rollout of Eth 2.0,” said Singhal.

This is because an address is required to maintain a balance of 32 ETH to become a validator in the impending transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, dubbed Ethereum 2.0.

In a proof-of-work mechanism (Ethereum’s current protocol), miners solve cryptographically difficult puzzles to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded.

In PoS, instead of miners, there are validators, which lock up some of their ether as a stake in the ecosystem. In layman’s terms, staking is similar to earning interest on a fixed income investment like bonds. Essentially, the protocol upgrade, which might be delayed to the third quarter, will allow holders to earn yield by staking.",2020-05-13 18:36:55+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/reddit-rolls-out-community-points-on-ethereum-to-incentivize-positive-behavior,"Reddit is expanding a trial program designed to let users reward each other for their contributions, using the Ethereum blockchain.

The program, called “Community Points,” was detailed in a slide presentation published Wednesday evening in which Reddit revealed its plans to utilize the Ethereum network to incentivize the creation of “quality posts and comments.” The points can be spent on premium features and used as a measure of reputation in the community, the social media platform said.

Users are rewarded based on their contribution to their favorite channels, with the community ultimately deciding how many points each user receives. Users can hoard their points or spend them on unique features such as badges, custom emojis and GIFs in comments.

“We continuously run experiments to explore features that engage our users and communities. With Community Points, we’re working exclusively with two communities to test this feature and gather feedback from our users,” a spokesperson for Reddit told CoinDesk. The spokesperson did not name the two communities, but an image on the announcement suggests they are r/Cryptocurrency and r/FortNiteBR.

In addition, users will be able to leave a tip for comments they like or posts they see as valuable. Users will also be able to transfer community points directly to another Reddit member’s Vault as well as any Ethereum wallet address.

In order to start contributing, users need to sign up to the “Vault,” Reddit’s local blockchain wallet, accessed via scanning a QR code through the official Reddit app.

According to the post, community points are controlled by the user where users retain full control, meaning moderators nor Reddit itself can take points away or decide how they should be spent.

As it currently stands, it can be hard for other members to see how much one user has contributed to a community. Reddit’s points hope to fix that by making the process more transparent with a total balance displayed next to their name.

There is a warning, however. A private key is provided once a user creates a Vault, which is stored locally on the user’s smart device. That means if the user doesn’t create a backup key and loses his phone, he will be unable to access the community points, with Reddit claiming even it will be unable to help.

How does it work?

According to Reddit, community points are run by “a suite of smart contracts that manage balanaces, distribution/claiming and purchasing memberships.” They utilize and leverage existing parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the ERC-20 token standards, which in turn have been reviewed by Trail of Bits, an independent blockchain security firm.

The transactions on Ethereum cost “gas,” which are tiny amounts of Ethereum’s native crypto, ether (ETH). Reddit has stated that since most users don’t own any ETH, the social platform is ready to cover the cost of gas “for now” for those using its in-built Vault, but those using other Ethereum wallets may be required to pay for the cost of gas themselves.

The platform said it plans to adopt a better scaling and gas solution in the future “as they emerge” while the rollout of community points remains in beta throughout the remainder of the summer.

Every once in a while, the amount of new bitcoin mined — distributed to miners, the folks with fleets of computers powering bitcoin’s database, or blockchain — is cut in half. Why does that matter? It slows the rate at which new bitcoin is introduced to the world as the cryptocurrency marches toward its 21 million coin cap.

That’s to say that, while you weren’t looking, the world of digital tokens and currencies has marched along, maturing to some degree as cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based services settle into slightly more predictable trading ranges.

The companies working in the crypto space are growing up as well, building out better, more sophisticated tooling for retail and institutional investors alike. FalconX is one such company, and today it announced that it has raised $17 million to date.

The crypto trading service — more on what it does in a moment — is backed by a legion of investors including Fidelity-affiliated Avon Ventures, corporate shop Coinbase Ventures, and a host of more traditional players including Lightspeed, Flybridge, Accel, Fenbushi, and Accomplice. Normally we’d curtail the list of investors to merely the most interesting, but in this case it felt reasonable to include them all, as the sheer number of capital shops that put up money for FalconX details that there is still niche and mainstream venture interest in at least some crypto-focused companies.

FalconX is also a company that anyone can understand, which probably helped. The company’s tech helps provide pricing information for cryptocurrencies, offering what it calls the “best” price for a period of time (seconds). That might sound somewhat simple, but it’s not; the crypto world is made up of a host of exchanges, is awash with fake trading volume and has a history of being pushed around by large accounts. To be able to offer a price, and hold onto it, is material.

The company is currently focused on institutional customers, which the company’s founders Raghu Yarlagadda and Prabhakar Reddy loosely described to TechCrunch as those with $10 million AUM (assets under management) and up. This likely makes KYC (know your customers) rules easier for the startup to follow.

FalconX makes money from trading fees, albeit in two ways. It offers either crypto prices with its fees included or on a fixed-fee model. Notably the firm says that crypto-native customers prefer the baked-in approach, while more traditional customers prefer the visible-fee method.

Either way, FalconX’s tech has found an audience. It has executed $7 billion in trading volume in the last 10 months (I asked about the seemingly odd time interval, which the firm explained as its most recent, fully-audited time period; it has seen more total volume during its life.)

That $7 billion volume result is likely why FalconX was able to attract external capital. And the fact that the startup appears to care about treating crypto seriously and not as a way to get around traditional banking regulations.

For example, after FalconX brought up anti-money laundering work during a discussion about regulation, TechCrunch asked the company how far it can look into its transactions to make sure that it isn’t accidentally helping bad folks get money. Yarlagadda responded, saying that “the future of regulation” in his space is “solving some of these problems and showing [them] to the [regulatory] agencies so that they get comfortable about the space.”

How is FalconX going about that? It uses “internal on-chain analytics” as well as third-parties to help get “context [into] which Bitcoin addresses, or Ethereum addresses, are associated with dark web or terrorist activities” to make sure that its trades are not winding up helping the wrong folks. This isn’t easy; the startup has to look through “six, seven hops” so that it can see if any money that goes through its service is suspect.

That seems pretty good, right? I found it impressive. Even more, after Yarlagadda joked that it’s not cheap to pay for the computing power needed to pull off that work, FalconX told TechCrunch that the expense counts as COGS. Neat!

There’s a fine line when covering anything blockchain-related between producing something that regular folks can understand, and writing something that the crypto-believing world won’t dismiss out of hand as insufficiently nuanced. Summing then, in case I swung too far towards the latter, FalconX built a pricing engine that allows big investors to make trades with more confidence. It gets paid when they trade and is processing lots of volume. That means its revenues are going up. And that’s why it raised more money.

The next question for FalconX is how fast it can scale volume. The faster it can, the more enticing it will prove to investors. And in time, if it does open up to more retail-sized traders, who knows, it could even become a household name.

Popular messaging app Telegram has shut down its TON cryptocurrency project. Telegram founder Pavel Durov explains that a US court has stopped his TON project and prevented the gram cryptocurrency from being distributed to investors, not just in the US but globally.

Telegram Discontinues TON Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Project

Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov announced on Tuesday his decision regarding the Telegram Open Network (TON) and cryptocurrency project after a long battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “Today is a sad day for us here at Telegram. We are announcing the discontinuation of our blockchain project … I am writing this post to officially announce that Telegram’s active involvement with TON is over,” the messaging app’s founder wrote, adding:

Unfortunately, a US court stopped TON from happening … the US court declared that grams [cryptocurrency] couldn’t be distributed not only in the United States, but globally.

According to the judge, “a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched. So, to prevent this, grams shouldn’t be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world – even if every other country on the planet seemed to be perfectly fine with TON,” Durov conveyed.

Because of the U.S. court’s finding, “we have made the difficult decision not to proceed with TON,” Durov confirmed but noted that this decision could change in the future. “Sadly, the US judge is right about one thing … we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology.”

TON Crypto Project and Durov’s Warnings

Durov explained that over the past two and a half years, his team has been working on “a next-generation blockchain platform called TON and a cryptocurrency we were going to name gram,” elaborating:

TON was designed to share the principles of decentralization pioneered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, but to be vastly superior to them in speed and scalability.

The TON crypto project raised about $1.7 billion from investors in 2018 in an initial coin offering (ICO). However, the SEC halted the sale in October 2019 claiming that the gram tokens were unregistered securities. In March, a U.S. judge affirmed the SEC decision and ruled that the gram cryptocurrency could not be distributed both in the U.S. and globally. Telegram then offered to pay investors back in two ways but U.S. investors only have the option of taking 72% refunds.

The TON developers claim that their blockchain would be faster and more efficient than the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. According to Durov, “existing networks such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains do not have the capability to replace high-volume transaction mechanisms like credit cards and fiat currency,” a court document reads.

Durov warned that some sites may be using his name, the Telegram brand, the name TON or gram cryptocurrency to promote their own projects. “Don’t trust them with your money or data,” he emphasized, adding that no one from his team is involved in any of them. “While networks based on the technology we built for TON may appear, we won’t have any affiliation with them and are unlikely to ever support them in any way. So be careful, and don’t let anyone mislead you,” he cautioned. In conclusion, Durov wrote: “I want to conclude this post by wishing luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world … This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.”

An email from the IRS, published by Cryptotrader.tax on Tuesday, stated: ""We are placing a few single-case contracts as pilots with a goal of publishing a solicitation and request for proposal for a larger multi-case contract.""

The IRS is looking for a third party to aggregate cryptocurrency transactions from on-chain data, off-chain data, APIs, and tax submissions, and then value the assets involved, and then determine gains and losses.



The document notes that ""specialized technology and infrastructure is required to digest, contain, and analyze virtual currency data due to unique requirements such as but not limited to decimal place precision, varying field formats, and file formats.”

Notably, the IRS hosted a summit on March 3 in a bid to open up dialogue on tax-related issues around cryptocurrencies. The agency invited cryptocurrency companies and advocates to the summit, which took place at its Washington D.C. headquarters.

The solicitation of help comes amid the IRS’s toughened stance on cryptocurrency tax evasion. In 2019, the agency sent out thousands of letters to cryptocurrency holders who allegedly failed to report their earnings. This year’s 1040 form also includes, for the first time, a question on taxpayers’ cryptocurrency activities.

As in Generation Crypto.

Gen C was born out of the 2008-9 financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto having inscribed the Jan. 3, 2009, London Times headline, “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” in Bitcoin’s Genesis Block.

The “traditional financial and governmental institutions suddenly seemed incompetent and illegitimate,” says Lana Swartz, assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virgina, of the effect of the financial meltdown. Alternate economic efforts like the “sharing economy” emerged, bringing with it companies like Airbnb in 2008 and Uber in 2009 and fueling the gig economy. The first iPhone had just come out in 2007, along with the mobile payment system M-Pesa. “You have all the things you need to re-vision money,” says Swartz, setting the stage for Bitcoin to go mainstream.

Of course, that didn’t quite happen (at least not as a full-on payment system), but Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology spurred myriad innovations, from altcoins to central bank digital currencies and decentralized communities giving grants to developers all over the world. Bitcoin’s newsworthy bull runs brought non-tech-savvy speculators into the space, along with startups and VCs looking to capitalize on this flashy, new blockchain technology – not to mention the companies from big banks to Walmart now operating private blockchains to facilitate payments and monitor supply chains.

The traditional financial and governmental institutions suddenly seemed incompetent and illegitimate.

While the number of people involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency grew, those dedicated to what they perceived as Satoshi’s original vision remained on the fringes, still influenced by the cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist thinking that helped shape the Bitcoin white paper. Two strains emerged among those involved in the space, Swartz says. There were the people attracted to Bitcoin mainly as a store of value “apart from fallible governance institutions” – the libertarian-leaning preppers awaiting another collapse. Others primarily embraced blockchain’s decentralized infrastructure, loosely evolving into the Ethereum builders and DAO members with somewhat utopian dreams for the technology’s future.

People carrying Satoshi’s legacy seem to have something in common. They think and act differently from the masses, taking institutionalized systems with several grains of salt and sometimes operating outside the financial establishment. They see the world differently, often overlooking nationalized borders with travel-heavy lifestyles and colleagues far flung across the globe. As a 2018 survey from market research company Global Web Index found, crypto holders share key characteristics: They are “risk tolerant, ambitious consumers with a strong sense of personal agency.” Krista Steele, a recruiter who works for blockchain companies, says of blockchain professionals, “They’re flexible and innovative…willing to work from anywhere and go anywhere.”

Now, eleven years after the birth of Bitcoin, another recession looms, but this one is different. “Since the 2008 recession, this is what a lot of Bitcoiners were expecting,” says Ann Brody, a social sciences researcher studying Ethereum at McGill University, “but I don’t think anyone could foresee that it would be a pandemic.” Because of their ethos and social structures, many members of “generation crypto” were prepared to weather a pandemic.

In a world that mistrusts contagion-carrying cash, many have long championed touchless payment systems. As the Federal Reserve prints money, bitcoin holders can feel increasingly smug about their non-fiat stores of wealth. The “money printers go brrrr” meme alerts the masses to “become aware that the current system is corrupted and we need alternatives,” Brody says, which cryptocurrencies and blockchain promise.

And those who’ve been working as parts of decentralized, global efforts are no strangers to the “WFH” ethos the masses have lately been forced to embrace due to stay-at-home orders.

Meet Generation Crypto

To draw an (admittedly early-stage) anthropological microscope over the group of people we’ll call “children of Satoshi,” we decided to interview a wide cross range of characters from across the cryptocurrency community and beyond.

Originally, this story was meant to be a snapshot of “generation crypto” in 2020, taking a look at various people who exemplify different aspects of this space and its ideologies. Mid-way through reporting, the coronavirus outbreak was characterized as a pandemic, crossing borders to affect the lives of everyone we spoke with – from a jet-setting investor with Chinese business partners to a farmer in rural Kenya, a libertarian lawyer in Connecticut to a digital nomad at the Women’s Economic Forum in Cairo.

So here is a small (and by no means exhaustive) sample of what “generation crypto” looks like going through the early stages of a pandemic. These are people who were adults when Bitcoin started, now operating in a disruptive industry that’s being disrupted. They’ve hunkered down in their friend’s mansion or mom’s houses or suburban second home, loaded up on food and even oxygen tanks, and are waiting bullishly for blockchain-powered currencies to moon.

This major adjustment to how the cryptocurrency operates has only happened twice before and happens every four years. But what does this actually mean and what impact will it have?

Q: how does bitcoin work?

Bitcoin is a digital currency that makes use of blockchain technology to store and record all transactions. First proposed in a white paper published online in 2008 by a mysterious person (or group of people) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The unique features of bitcoin compared to fiat currencies like dollars or pounds are that there is no central authority or bank. Each member of the network has equal power. This decentralised network is completely transparent and all transactions can be read on the blockchain. At the same time it offers privacy in terms of who owns the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoins are created (or mined) by so-called miners who contribute computing power to securing the network, as well as processing transactions on the network by solving complex mathematical puzzles through computational power. These miners are rewarded for their work processing the transactions on the blockchain with bitcoins. But to combat inflation, Nakamoto wrote into the code that the total number of bitcoins that will ever exist will be 21 million. Right now there are 18.38 million.

The first ever block recorded on the bitcoin blockchain was on January 3 2009 where Nakamoto received 50 bitcoins. In the white paper, Nakamoto specified that after every 210,000 blocks the reward for miners will half. So the first halving took place on November 28 2012 where the miner’s reward was reduced from 50 bitcoins to 25 bitcoins. The second halving was on July 9 2016 and the miner’s reward was reduced from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins. And the third, most recent halving on May 11 2020 means bitcoin miners now receive 6.25 bitcoins.

Q: Why does bitcoin halve?

Nakamoto has never explained explicitly the reasons behind the halving. Some speculate the halving system was designed to distribute coins more quickly at the beginning to incentive people to join the network and mine new blocks. Block rewards are programmed to halve at regular intervals because the value of each coin rewarded is deemed likely to increase as the network expanded. However, this may lead to users holding bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it as a medium of exchange.

Q: What impact does halving have on bitcoin?

The obvious impact is that the amount of newly mined bitcoins per day will fall from about 1,800 to 900 bitcoins and the daily revenue of miners will reduce by half. This decrease in the rate of bitcoin creation tightens supply and some argue will lead to a bullish market and an increase in the price of bitcoin.

Meanwhile, the reduction of revenue for miners may squeeze out miners who are least efficient and therefore the computing power connected to the Bitcoin network may fall significantly.

The previous two halvings led to the most dramatic bull runs in Bitcoin’s history, although initially there was a brief sell-off. Marcus Swanepoel, co-founder and CEO of Luno, a cryptocurrency wallet which lets you store and carry out bitcoin transactions, believes that bitcoin may achieve a growth of 270% between this and the fourth halving in 2024.

Q: How is coronavirus affecting things?

Although bitcoin has gained more than 20% since the beginning of the year, where this halving may differ from its predecessors is the volatile and uncertain economic environment that it has taken place in. The International Monetry Fund predicted a 3% shrinking of global growth in its April forecast and this is expected to fall further. In the UK, the Bank of England has projected a decrease of 30% in the country’s GDP during the first half of 2020.

Some argue that bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a potential hedge against fiat currencies that are vulnerable to devaluation in times of economic crisis. But others believe the halving won’t necessarily boost its price as people knew the halving was going to happen so it should be already priced into the market activity.

The only certainty is that the growth of new bitcoins has halved. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the price and interest of this cryptocurrency.

Correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly said Michael Dubrovsky speculated the halving system was designed to distribute coins more quickly at the beginning to incentive people to join the network and mine new blocks.",2020-05-14 10:08:03+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-bounced-miners-switching-off-post-halving,"While bitcoin is fast reversing its pre-halving price drop, some miners still look to be leaving the network.

At time of writing, the top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $9,730, representing a 20% gain on the low of $8,100 observed Sunday – the day before Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving.

The bounce has erased more than 75% of the drop from $10,500 to $8,100 seen in the three days to May 10.

While the price has recovered a major portion of the lost ground, the cryptocurrency’s hashrate (the total computing power dedicated to mining blocks on the blockchain) has declined to 98 exahashes (EH/s) – that’s down 27% from the high of 135 EH/s observed on Monday, according to data source bitinfocharts.com.

The one-day hashrate often sees rapid fluctuations and provides less useful information about the broader trend. Hence, most observers prefer the seven-day average of the hashrate, which smooths out daily fluctuations.

That average, too, has dropped to 114 EH/s from the pre-halving high of 122 EH/s, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

The decline in the hashrate suggests some miners have scaled back or shut down operations following Monday’s halving of block rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, which makes returning a profit harder or impossible with older mining machines (depending on the price). Validating that argument is the recent uptick in the mean block interval time, or the average time taken to mine a block.

Source: Glassnode

The mean block interval time rose to 727 seconds or 12 minutes on Wednesday from a low of 8.5 minutes observed on Sunday.

The halving was expected to crowd out some miners, especially the ones using older-generation mining devices like Bitmain’s Antminer S9s.

While speaking at Consensus: Distributed on Tuesday, Alex de Vries, founder of financial and economic news portal Digiconomist and blockchain specialist, said, “S9s miners have already lived longer than expected and bitcoin’s price will have to double for these machines to become viable again.”

De Vries also predicted a decline of up to 20% in the hashrate in the short term. So far, the seven-day average has dropped by 6.5%.

However, if prices continue to rise, even the older-generation machines might once more be worth switching on, especially as electricity costs are expected to go down with the arrival of the monsoon season in China’s Sichuan province, a region that contributes over 50% of the total mining power on the Bitcoin network.

But even if prices rise over $13,760, the Antminer S9 would still be operating at a slight loss, according to a calculator provided by Poolin.

Some observers believe the miner capitulation happened during the first half of March when the cryptocurrency’s price fell from $9,000 to $3,867. “We already had a mini halving in March due to the price crash. We don’t expect a big drop in the hash rate in the short-term (sic),” said de Vries on Twitter.

A move above $13,000 looks unlikely right now, though a break above $10,000 cannot be ruled out because bitcoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges have continued to decline post-halving – a sign of long-term bullish sentiment.

The blockchain-based tokens may be earned as rewards for posting content to Reddit’s online forums.

The two tokens, $BRICKS and $MOONS, will be awarded to user accounts that are members of the subreddits /r/Cryptocurrency and /r/FortniteBR, respectively. This token-based incentivization scheme is part of the social media network’s new project, “Community Points.”

Details shared by Redditor “MagoCrypto” reveal that Reddit had associated or attached an Ethereum address to the accounts of certain users.

Mago noted that based on the information provided, Reddit would be using the digital tokens to assist “power” users with accessing certain features on the platform.

Reddit admin “Jarins” has confirmed that the tokens will be used on Reddit. He recently published a post, titled “Introducing r/CryptoCurrency Moons,” (to the CryptoCurrency subreddit) which notes that the tokens are now available on the social media platform.

All versions of Community Points will be ERC-20 compliant tokens. Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet has been used for beta testing. The tokens have been “managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships.”

Adam Cochran, partner at MetalCartel Ventures, an Ethereum VC fund, stated:

“Today, Reddit introduced about 20M new users to cryptocurrency in a matter of seconds. That’s how many users visit Reddit’s /r/Cryptocurrency and /r/FortniteBR on any given month.”

On the pretext of pandemic panic, the U.S. Federal Reserve is printing and spending $41 billion a day. Altogether, the Fed and other central banks will create more than $6 trillion in new money in 2020.

This is industrial-scale corruption of currency, and it is releasing elemental forces — that will not be denied.

Bitcoin (BTC, Tech/Adoption Grade “A”) was invented during the 2008 financial crisis as an exit-ramp from a currency system on the eve of extinction.

Like gold, it gives you a safe place to store your wealth, and the wherewithal to ride out the monetary apocalypse that's bearing down on us.

But it has not always been easy for average investors to buy. Not long ago, opening an account at a cryptocurrency exchange (a crypto broker) was a tedious, frustrating process, taking five or six weeks to complete.

Happily, much has improved since. Not only have cryptocurrency exchanges become less intimidating, but often you may not need them at all.

Here are the three easiest ways to buy Bitcoin without a crypto exchange account:

1. Choose a Do-It-All Digital Wallet

A digital wallet is a secure, encrypted location where you store your cryptocurrencies. A do-it-all wallet not only safely stores Bitcoin (as well as dozens of other cryptos). It also lets you purchase the Bitcoin to put in it — usually with a charge-card.

(Plus, if you get the itch to trade, you can swap your Bitcoin for any other cryptos it accommodates at prevailing market prices — all inside the wallet.)

Best of all, you can download the following do-it-all wallets for free.

Atomic Wallet (https://atomicwallet.io/)

Atomic is a popular laptop/desktop wallet that accommodates Bitcoin (and about 300 other cryptos). It's very secure, because you — and you alone — hold the private keys that control access to it.

You can buy Bitcoin with your VISA or Mastercard — for which Atomic charges a 5% fee per transaction. (And you can trade your Bitcoin among any of the other coins the wallet supports — at market rates.)

There's also an Atomic app (for Apple and Android smartphones), which syncs with your desktop installation. With it, you can check prices (or trade) anywhere you have an internet connection.

Exodus (https://www.exodus.io)

Exodus is another laptop/desktop digital wallet for storing Bitcoin and several dozen other cryptos. Because you are in sole possession of the private keys, security is very strong.

(As with Atomic, Exodus allows you to trade among any of its supported cryptos inside the wallet.)

There's also an Exodus app for Apple smartphones, which syncs with the desktop installation. Plus, you can use Apple Pay to buy Bitcoin.

This service is presently available in 43 U.S. states. (It's still awaiting approval in Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Vermont and Virginia.)

2. Visit One of America's 5,840 Bitcoin ATMs

In recent years, Bitcoin ATMs have been popping up like mushrooms after a summer rain. Just about every medium-sized city in some 76 countries now has at least one. (Chicago, for example, has 293.)

And finding one has never been easier. A free app (BTC CoinATMRadar) downloadable to your smart phone identifies the ones nearest to you and displays their precise location on Google maps.

BTC CoinATMRadar is also available as a website (https://coinatmradar.com/)

CoinFlip (https://www.coinflip.tech/bitcoin-atm/) is another website that helps you locate the nearest Bitcoin ATM on their network.

Bitcoin ATMs work much like regular ATMs. Only instead of moving dollars out of or in to a bank account, they redeem Bitcoin in your digital wallet for dollars. Or, convert the dollars you insert into Bitcoin in your wallet.

Any crypto wallet will suffice. However, the smartphone versions of Atomic and Exodus are especially convenient in this regard. That's because they both can convert your wallet address (which looks like a long string of garbage characters) to a bar code on your smartphone screen.

Just hold it up in front the scanning window on the ATM, and you're done. That sure beats having to type in a long character string to communicate your wallet address.

Not surprisingly, Bitcoin ATMs charge for the convenience they provide. Fees vary according the type of machine and location.

But generally, the fee for using a Bitcoin ATM to convert your crypto to cash runs about 4% or 5%. The opposite transaction (feeding paper dollars into the ATM to convert to Bitcoin in your digital wallet) … typically comes with a fee of 7% or 8%.

3. Buy Bitcoin Using Your Regular Stockbroker

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a publicly-listed, closed-end fund that holds Bitcoin.

Anyone can buy and sell it through their regular stockbroker without restriction.

Plus, its price movements follow Bitcoin very closely.

During 2017 — as the wild and woolly crypto bull market sent Bitcoin blasting up to all-time highs — GBTC shot up more than 1,300%.

So you see, GBTC is virtually the equivalent of investing in Bitcoin itself. And that can be quite a good thing — especially if you're a newcomer to crypto, with little time to spend familiarizing yourself with this quirky new class of investment assets.

So far, so good. But we live in a world of trade-offs. And as you saw with Bitcoin ATMS, convenience always comes with some kind of cost.

Here, the major drawback is that GBTC shares consistently trade at prices well above (often 20% to 35%) what the underlying Bitcoin is actually worth.

One Way or Another, Be Sure To Buy Some Bitcoin

As we go to press, Argentina is teetering on the brink of its ninth sovereign default. And the ruing mullahs in Teheran are getting ready to knock three zeros off the Iranian currency (US$1 = 42,105 rials), and re-issue it.

As hard-money historian, Dr. Franz Pick, observed: ""In the end, all paper currencies go to zero."" You wake up one morning to find your greenbacks no longer worth the paper they're printed on.

So don't be caught holding the bag. Move at least part of your savings to Bitcoin. But don't go whole hog and invest every last dime. It's still a high-risk asset.

And don't expect instant gratification. It may still take some time (not much, but some) for Bitcoin to truly take off.

Best,

Bruce Ng and Juan Villaverde

Bitwala’s new cryptocurrency service is being offered through a partnership with the developers of the Celsius Network, a major digital assets lending platform.

DefiPrime data confirms that Bitwala is the first traditional fiat bank to begin offering interest for holding Bitcoin in bank accounts.

There are currently several other decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and services, such as BlockFi, that are offering similar interest-generating options. Although the DeFi products usually have higher rates of return, with some offering as much as 8-9% returns per year, Bitwala says it’s more regulated.

Bitwala presently provides fiat and cryptocurrency-related services in 32 different European countries. The company offers its services under an operational license from SolarisBank AG, a leading German financial institution.

Customers can purchase small amounts of BTC (as little as €30 \worth) and then hold it in their free Bitcoin interest account, while earning interest payouts each week. The Bitcoin in the accounts is loaned out via the Celsius Network to “trusted” business partners. There’s also an option to easily convert the cryptocurrency back to Euros if needed.

Ben Jones, CEO at Bitwala, noted that the recent BTC halving should serve as a reminder that the “state money (fiat) cannot be inflated eternally.”

He added:

“At this time, more and more people trust in Bitcoin. Bitwala is the everyday bridge to it. We are now partnering with Celsius Network, the world’s leading provider of crypto loans, so that our customers can leverage Bitcoin holdings wherever they are”

During the past few years, neobanks or all-digital challengers have been trying to harness the benefits of both the fiat and crypto-based finance sectors. However, a relatively small number of these Fintechs are able to acquire a full banking license, and none had been providing legitimate Bitcoin investment options.

In 2018, Revolut managed to get a full banking license in Europe. However, the company has not yet been able to acquire an Australian banking license, which is needed for expanding its operations.",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/05/16038293/bitcoin-ripple-tezos-american-wrap,"Bitcoin price has gained over 6% on a day-to-day basis and 4% since the start of Thursday. The first digital coin hit the intraday high of $9,944 and retreated t0 $9,720 by the time of writing. The further recovery is capped psychological $10,000, which is still a hard nut to crack for Bitcoin bulls. This barrier prevents BTC from moving towards $10 500. Once it is cleared, the recovery may start snowballing.

While the short-term momentum remains bullish, the RSI on the intraday charts has shown signs of reversal, which means, the coin may stay range-bound in the nearest future.

Ripple’s XRP is in good shape to replace Swift as an international payment network, according to the Ripple founder Chris Larsen. Speaking in the interview on the Block Stars podcast, he said that banks were unlikely to use Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system for validating transactions. To prove the point, he underlined that banks may be wary of the risks of 51% attack, in which a miner or a group of miners can gain control over more than 50% of the network hash rate and manipulate the entries in the ledger.

Tezos has had better days and today XTZ has broken some key technical levels. The price has now made a lower high wave on the 4-hour chart below and the support zone of 2.61 has also been taken out and subsequently used as resistance.

The Fibonacci extension target at the 161.8% area has been hit perfectly and now the price has retraced back to the aforementioned resistance zone. Moving forward if this is to be the 3rd wave in the Elliott Wave series then a break of 2.23 is on the cards.

All rights reserved.",,https://www.coindesk.com/copper-credit-risk-exposure-crypto,"Infrastructure provider Copper claims its new trading tool solves an obstacle preventing institutional investors from trading more freely in the cryptocurrency space by letting two parties hold on to their assets until just before executing a trade.

The London-based firm said Thursday that ClearLoop – which facilitates fast, off-exchange settlements – would pretty much negate one of the chief concerns institutional investors have with the crypto space: namely, the risk involved with trusting an exchange to look after their trading capital.

Most exchanges require clients to deposit digital assets with them, in a hot wallet, before they’ll allow them to trade. While this is usually not a problem, there’s always the risk an exchange might get hacked or, in the case of QuadrigaCX, disappear into thin air.

Known as credit risk exposure, this is the same risk factor that caused many financial institutions to bite their nails off during the 2008 financial crash. For institutional investors with more than a passing interest in the crypto space, the problem of having to trust an exchange to look after their capital precludes many of them from depositing and trading as much as they may otherwise like.

“This is a massive problem in the sector,” Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev told CoinDesk. Many funds try to trade on multiple exchanges – 15 in some cases – and generally perform due diligence and full risk assessments before they use a new one.

“Not only do they not have the capacity to do that assessment, more often than not it’s not the investors’ field [so] it’s hard for them to do it in the first place,” he said. He quoted one of Copper’s clients who claimed credit risk exposure was almost always the main concern investors had with the cryptocurrency space.

What ClearLoop does is remove this trust element from exchanges. Clients hold their trading capital themselves, either in a cold wallet or custodial solution, while they initialize a trade with an interested party. It’s only at the last moment, once the trade has actually been completed, that ClearLoop transfers digital assets from the client onto the exchange and then into the buyer’s possession.

Not only does this keep the time the exchange holds a digital asset to an absolute minimum, it radically speeds the trading process. Copper claims ClearLoop takes transaction times down to about 100 milliseconds – about the same as a blink of an eye.

On May 14, Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver sat down with Digifinex cofounder, Kiana Shek, for an ask-me-anything (AMA) session about the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ver explained what he thinks about the central banks printing unlimited money, the government-induced lockdowns, and his opinions about certain cryptocurrencies like BTC, BCH, XRP, ETH, and more.

Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver Discusses the Crypto Ecosystem on Digifinex Live

On Thursday, Digifinex cofounder Kiana Shek during an AMA at 8 a.m. ET, asked Ver about the economic crisis and massive amounts if stimulus central banks have created during the last two months.

Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver: The pandemic is a real disease and a real problem. But the reaction to it so far, seems to be much much worse than the disease itself. You see governments all over the world doing these economic stimulus packages. If printing money and just giving everybody some of it will make it so people never have to work again, why didn’t we do that for the last 100 years?

The fact of the matter is we need production, printing money, and giving people a bunch of checks doesn’t do anything. That’s not real economic progress. You actually have to have people building the businesses and building the goods and supplying the goods that people actually need in their lives. It’s not going to take long to realize that if you pay everyone to stay home and not work we are going to start running out of the things people need. So if anything, the exact opposite needs to be done. We need to have people go back to work and start producing the things the world needs.

The Digifinex cofounder then asked Ver about his stance toward supporting Bitcoin Cash and why his position had changed.

Roger Ver: To be clear, I didn’t change anything and I’ve been promoting the exact same thing for almost ten years now and that’s peer-to-peer electronic cash for the entire world. And sadly what everyone is calling bitcoin (BTC) today, that project got hijacked. It’s goal is no longer to be peer-to-peer cash for the world, which is the very title of the white paper. In fact, it got hijacked so badly that the people who run Bitcoin.org were talking about how to get rid of the white paper altogether because it was confusing people. Individuals who read the Bitcoin white paper and it’s clearly not talking about what everyone is calling Bitcoin. The Bitcoin white paper is talking about something much closer to Bitcoin Cash.

I am a fan of anything that works and puts people in charge of their own money. So they can send and receive money with anyone, anywhere, anytime without needing permission from anyone.

I think the cryptocurrency that has the best chance of doing that, for the most people is bitcoin cash. So from my point of view, I didn’t change anything at all, the original bitcoin project now just happens to be called Bitcoin Cash. The thing that everyone is calling bitcoin today in the media, it doesn’t have a white paper, it doesn’t have the same roadmap. They managed to hijack the bitcoin brand name, recognition, and network effect and all of the infrastructure built in the early days by people like myself. If you look at it before that split happened, pretty much every single business that was supporting people actually using bitcoin as money, supported bitcoin being able to scale so it could be money for the whole world. We had businesses like Coinbase, Blockchain.com, Bitpay, and on and on. The problem became so big that even Bitcoin.com could no longer support the thing called bitcoin.

The short answer is I didn’t change anything and what people are calling bitcoin today changed.

Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash for the Entire World

Kiana Shek then asked Ver about his thoughts on a price target for BCH in the future.

Roger Ver: If you look at it, Bitcoin Cash is trying to be money for the whole world. To have people using it all across the globe and even if it is a little bit successful in that, the price of bitcoin cash could easily go up 1000X where it is today. $230 dollars per coin could easily go up to $230,000 dollars. BTC is never going up a 1,000X more than it is today. It’s $10,000 already it’s not going to go up 1,000X, it’s just not going to happen. Because it’s not trying to be money for the world, and if it continued on the path of trying to be money for the world then it could have done that.

In order for someone to use something it has to be useful and bitcoin with its slow transaction times, high network fees, and unreliable payments is not something that is useful. The reason it is still going up right now is because it has the bitcoin brand name and recognition. And everyone sees that the price is almost $10K and if they try and use it for anything other than speculation, they’re gonna have a bad user experience.

There’s a whole bunch of other cryptocurrencies that have a much better user experience.

Kiana Shek also asked about some of the infrastructure Ver was excited about.

Roger Ver: There’s actually more physical shops accepting bitcoin cash than those accepting bitcoin at this point. We have this fantastic tool called the Bitcoin Cash Register app that anyone can download for an iPhone or Android device and anyone can accept BCH at their business in like 30 seconds. You don’t have to give your name, you don’t have to give an email address, you don’t have to give a tax ID number, it just works and works in every country in the world. That’s something that used to be possible with bitcoin but its not with the high fees and network congestion. So if you haven’t seen the Bitcoin Cash Register app yet, check that out.

We are seeing a lot of activity in China with our peer-to-peer marketplace Local.Bitcoin.com where people can buy or sell bitcoin cash using any payment method from any country. We’re seeing a significant amount of Chinese buying and selling bitcoin cash using the platform with a noncustodial escrow system. Another thing that is not possible using bitcoin (BTC) today, so its really great to see all the innovation happening within the BCH ecosystem. And tokens too and in fact, if we have time for it we can even make a Kiana Shek token this morning. It would take about 30 seconds. You can put your face as the image of the token and you can send and receive those tokens with anyone all over the world.

The Digifinex cofounder told Ver he would be welcomed to visit Asia soon to discuss his opinions again.

Roger Ver: I would love to get back to Asia soon but I am currently in St Kitts in the Caribbean and because of the coronavirus here there not allowing any flights in or out of the country. So I’ll be here for the foreseeable future.

Kiana Shek also asked Ver to name a few projects he was most proud of.

Roger Ver: There’s quite a few like a lot of people who don’t realize it but I was actually the second person ever involved in Ripple (XRP). XRP is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world. I put in some seed money to start that and obviously it was incredibly successful. Also Blockchain.com, I was the second person ever involved in that project and I contacted the founder and offered to help. There’s been a bunch of different things like that where I was basically one of the very first people to get involved. Those are probably two of the most well known; Blockchain.com and Ripple. And of course, Bitcoin.com has been a huge success too. We’ve seen over 11 million wallets created on that platform now and users can spread peer-to-peer cash all over the world.

Kiana Shek asked what types of future projects Ver is looking forward to seeing developed as well.

Roger Ver: I think that you have to look at projects that are useful and if it’s not useful no one is going to want to use it. Something that I like is going to be different than something that some else likes so we have to look at what everyone wants to use. An example of that is the app Tik Tok. I don’t have any interest in Tik Tok whatsoever, but other people love Tik Tok. So Tik Tok is very successful because of that even though I personally don’t have any interest in Tik Tok.

The same thing is true for cryptocurrency apps, like Crypto Kitties. I had zero interest in Crypto Kitties myself but other people seemed to love that sort of thing. I think people are going to love making their own token, with their own picture and they’ll be able to swap the tokens. And that’s so easy to do at Mint.Bitcoin.com.

People interested in watching the remainder of the interview can join the Digifinex AMA chat room on Telegram and a full version of the video will soon be published, according to Digifinex. During the rest of the conversation, Ver discusses being a smart investor, his thoughts on USDT and stablecoins, and SLP-based tokenization as well.

With several services and pools of liquidity under one roof, Bequant is able to help institutional clients trade and expand their portfolios while keeping transaction costs low. Additional services include collateral management tools, smart order routing, leveraged trade execution and over-the-counter (OTC) block trading.

“We are tailored to a lot of quant [hedge funds] and our clients typically look at trading through automated strategies, arbitrage, you name it,” Bequant CEO George Zarya said. “What they require is … one account to access liquidity pools, manage collateral and gain access to lending.”

In traditional finance, prime brokerage refers to a bundle of specialized services offered by investment banks and securities dealers to their hedge fund clients. There are few prime brokers in the crypto space, but Bequant’s largest competitor is Tagomi, a New York-based prime broker that became the 22nd member of Facebook’s Libra Association earlier this year.

Crypto exchanges such as Gibraltar-based Huobi offer their own brokerage services as an additional service for institutional investors, but it’s still rare to find companies that offer a full range of prime brokerage tools.

Bequant provides access to spot trading at exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks. The London-based firm plans to offer access to derivative liquidity pools in the future, Zarya said.

In an age in which the Federal Reserve is running the proverbial printing presses overtime, creating asset bubbles and stoking fears of inflation, Bitcoin cannot be printed at will. Its supply is regulated by the mining process, and halving is an important part of that process.

Well, ""halving"" is where the reward for mining gets chopped in half. The same amount of number crunching generates half the number of new Bitcoins.

To incentivize people to support the blockchain – dedicating their computer resources to maintaining the ledger – the system allows those that participate to ""mine"" new Bitcoin. The algorithm that governs the cryptocurrency rewards freshly mined Bitcoin to miners for volunteering their computers for transaction processing.

First, a little background. Bitcoin runs on a blockchain, which is an open, digital ledger that records every transaction made in the history of the cryptocurrency. Because the ledger is distributed across every computer on the network, it's extremely difficult to hack. There is no central database that can be tampered with. All transactions are recorded on every computer in the network and open for all to see.

If you're a little unsure about what exactly a Bitcoin halving means, don't feel bad. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique vocabulary that is all but nonsensical to the uninitiated. Today, we're going to explain what a halving is and what it means to investors in the space.

In case you missed it, Bitcoin just underwent a ""halving,"" the third in the cryptocurrency's history, on March 11.

By chopping the mining reward in half, the algorithm ensures that the supply of Bitcoin doesn't grow too quickly, creating inflation.

Mining Bitcoin isn't cheap. Running the computers and keeping them cool uses a ridiculous amount of energy. A report last year found that if the Bitcoin blockchain were a country, it would be the 41st biggest user of electricity in the world, consuming more power than Switzerland.

By one estimate, the average pre-halving cost to mine a single Bitcoin was $6,851. Post-halving, the average cost is anticipated to be more than $12,500.

What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Prices?

Like any other commodity, the price of Bitcoin comes down to supply and demand. When demand outstrips supply, prices rise. When supply outstrips demand, prices fall. It really is that simple.

Except that with Bitcoin, it's not.

Bitcoin only works when it has a functioning blockchain, and that blockchain is expensive to maintain. If it costs more than $12,500 to mine a coin, then the price of a coin needs to be pretty close to $12,500 or ideally higher to incentivize miners to continue dedicating resources to the blockchain. With Bitcoin prices currently below $10,000, the average miner is actually losing money here.

The cost of mining Bitcoin can be thought of as the coin's intrinsic value. But there is no guarantee that the coins will fetch that amount.

If the price of Bitcoin stayed below the cost to mine it for long, miners would drop out. As with unprofitable oil wells, operators can't run at a loss forever.

Of course, more efficient mining computers can lower the cost of mining, making it profitable at lower prices. But higher mining costs remain a risk to the long-term viability of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

It also remains to be seen how well the network will run once the crypto is maxed out at 21 million Bitcoin. Miners will have to be compensated for continuing to maintain the network, but it's unclear exactly how that will work once the day comes.

Thankfully, that day is likely at least 100 years away.

So, what happens next for Bitcoin? That remains to be seen, of course. But in an era in which investors look at central bank stimulus efforts with an increasingly skeptical eye, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin, gold and other anti-currencies continue to trend higher.",2020-05-15 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-halving-slashed-networks-hashrate/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin's hashrate fell by 30% between May 9 and May 12 because of the halving.

Mining remains profitable for miners with efficient machines despite the drop in total hashrate.

The network is behaving the way it did in previous halvings, indicating healthy long-term growth.

Declining profitability will put hobbyist miners out of business, further centralizing mining in China.

Bitcoin’s hashrate has declined since the halving—an expected result of reduced block rewards. The falling network hashrate has a few interesting implications.

The halving reduced miner block rewards from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, reducing inflation on the network and discouraging firms from mining new coins.

Bitcoin Hashrate Down By 30%

Total network hashrate is the amount of computational power dedicated to mining new BTC across the network. Based on data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin’s hashrate fell from 136 exahashes to 95 exahashes between May 9 and May 12, representing a 30% drop in the network’s total hashrate.

Nonetheless, network hashrates fluctuate regularly. The fluctuation after the halving is a normal part of mining. Revenues from mining Bitcoin have halved. As a consequence, the network hashrate will drop as miners take older machines offline.

That said, the drop has barely affected long-term trends. Since 2008, Bitcoin’s hashrate has grown consistently over the long term, even after its past halvings in 2012 and 2016.

With these characteristics in mind, Bitcoin’s hashrate will continue to rise despite this week’s drop as mining devices get more efficient (and as Bitcoin prices continue to increase).

Mining Remains Profitable

Bitcoin miners use specialized ASIC devices that produce many more hashes than conventional computer hardware. Yet, electricity costs and depreciation also come into play. Older devices consume more electricity, meaning that high electricity bills can reduce mining profits to zero for some ASICs, or even result in losses.

Nonetheless, the latest ASIC mining devices are still moderately profitable because of their energy-efficient designs. The Antminer S19 pro, for example, brings in mining profits of $1.29 per day based on an electricity cost of $0.09/kWH. Electricity rates above $0.09 are no longer profitable, putting many hobbyist miners out of business and further centralizing mining the hands of mostly Chinese miners.

Mining revenues have decreased by 50%, so it may come as a surprise that the network hashrate only dropped by 30%. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. Less efficient miners tend to deploy in regions with cheap electricity. Additionally, some miners operate at a loss, expecting a long-term increase in Bitcoin prices.

Miners are BTC Price Sensitive

If this year’s halving succeeds in driving up Bitcoin prices in the future, Bitcoin mining could become profitable for older devices in the future.

Based on past halvings, it could take several months for that to happen. Bitcoin prices are volatile, as always. Although Bitcoin prices are rising and approaching $10,000, it is not necessarily a sign of a long-term rally since prices plunged before the halving.

Meanwhile, miners will begin to mine other coins that rely on Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hash function. Bitcoin Cash, for example, saw its hashrate increase from 1.4 exahashes to 3.4 exahashes between May 10 and May 12, indicating that some miners moved to the altcoin.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin will remain the focus for miners. The current emission rate of 900 BTC per day equates to revenues of $8.5 million across the entire network, meaning that mining will remain lucrative for specialized firms.",2020-05-15 07:37:09+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-derivatives-exchange-ftx-launches-bitcoin-hashrate-futures/,"Crypto Derivatives Exchange FTX Launches Bitcoin Hashrate Futures

On Friday, cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX launched a hashrate futures tool that allows Bitcoin (BTC) miners to hedge against mining difficulty risk.

Hashrate, the amount of processing power dedicated to a Bitcoin network at a given time, determines the strength and security of the network.

FTX leverages mining difficulty, that is, the complexity of solving equations that validate bitcoin transactions.

According to the exchange, such a method is necessary because it is impossible to determine exact hashrate, beyond approximating it from block times and difficulty.

The futures product that went live on May 15, 2020, determines the hashrate by calculating the average difficulty of a Bitcoin network every day throughout the quarter.

Since “difficulty adjustments attempt to maintain 10m block times, over long periods of time the average hashrate will be proportional to the average difficulty. So that means that, roughly speaking, difficulty futures should behave similarly to hashrate futures,” FTX said in a blog post announcing the product.

At the moment there are three BTC hashrate futures contracts available – the first is for the third quarter of 2020, then Q4 2020 and first quarter 2021, FTX said. The contract due to expire in Q1 2021 was up 21% at the time of writing.

FTX chief executive officer Bankman-Fried stated that the company introduced the tool in response to significant interest from miners and related companies, according to online media reports. The platform first revealed plans to develop hashrate futures nine months ago.

The futures market is expanding, with the latest product coming a week after Bitfinex launched a contract related to Bitcoin’s performance against other coins.

A BTC hashrate contract has, however, been previously developed by crypto brokerage firm Bit Ooda, while Interhash has also been exploring derivative products to offer miners.

In January, software developer Jeremy Rubin announced the launch of Powswap, a platform that allows people to speculate on hashrate to offer “mining derivatives with no trust required.”

FTX announced that hashrate futures will not be available to U.S miners, as it the case with its other products.

-Alexander Graham Bell

In our previous article, we discussed the sad circumstances under which the Telegram Open Network was closed and how their blockchain was essentially blocked.

Magic internet points are kind of Reddit’s thing, and unlike likes on Facebook and hearts on Instagram and Twitter, Reddit Karma is cumulative and displayed prominently when visiting a user’s profile. So every time someone upvotes your comment or post, it adds permanent clout.

Over the last year or so, the platform has been experimenting with other kinds of internal reddit coins that users can purchase for real money and award to other users. They started with gold, then moved to silver and platinum, and by now, they have an entire array of imaginary badges that can be bestowed on your fellow users to reward them for their creativity.

Now, for the first time ever, they’ve implemented a coin that can be taken off the platform and will be implemented as an Ethereum-based (ERC20) token. The new digital assets, called “ moons ,” will be used exclusively to reward users for their participation in the r/CryptoCurrency community, a sub-reddit that first crossed 1 million subscribers last month.

Something tells me, this sub is about to go viral.

Be Prepared

It seems a growing number of analysts are now opining that the strong recovery that we’ve seen so far in the stock markets is nothing more than a bear market rally.

Sean Williams may not be the most well-known analyst out there, but he does have a few thousand followers on Twitter and has been writing for the Motley Fool for 10 years. Here’s an article he wrote this morning making the above case abundantly clear.

A lot of what Sean is saying here isn’t particularly new, but is a bit shocking considering the username “TMFUltraLong.” He discusses how the Fed is providing investors with false hope, and can’t necessarily do much to save the economy.

How the virus is completely in charge and is likely to remain so for quite some time. And how Q2 earnings are not only going to be of the worst in history, we don’t even have any guidance from the companies themselves. These are all things that we’ve been discussing here ad nauseam.

What is interesting here, however, is the conclusion and recommendations. Mr. Long doesn’t seem to be an advocate of shorting the markets.

Rather, he’s recommending you accumulate as much dry powder as possible in order to be prepared, because you never know how long it can take for the stock markets to meet the reality of the underlying economy. It could be tomorrow, or in a week, a month, a year, or maybe never.

Detached

But stocks aren’t the only assets currently detached from their underlying fundamentals. It seems that bitcoin might be as well. At the moment, a giant game of chicken is playing out between all miners leading into the upcoming difficulty adjustment on May 19th.

Right about now, it seems the market is not even close to realizing the impact of the reduced supply yet.",2020-05-15 16:36:59+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/jk-rowling-asks-about-bitcoin-accursed-crypto-twitter-scares-her-off,"JK Rowling probably wasn’t expecting to unleash the bitcoin community’s pent-up passion and imagination when she tweeted two sentences asking about bitcoin.

But the author of the Harry Potter series did. Responding to a tweet from CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen, Rowling tweeted: “I don’t understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me.” In just two hours her tweet had spawned 1,300 replies.

It took less than three hours for her to follow up with, “I don’t think I trust this.”

Lurking below the Twitter surface is a massive community of people who tweet about almost nothing except bitcoin and cryptocurrency day in and day out, dying to use their niche know-how for the good of the world. Rowling accidentally tapped into it.

In attempts to speak Rowling’s language, many started comparing bitcoin to the wizarding world from her books.

“Remember how He Who Must Not Be Named placed 7 [horcruxes] in different objects around the world in an attempt to immortalize himself, so that no one, not even the Ministry of Magic could stop him?” blockchain lawyer Jenny Leung tweeted.

He Who Must Not Be Named (aka Lord Voldemort) thought it would be unlikely anyone could find all seven horcruxes, making him impervious to destruction.

Similarly, under the hood, bitcoin is composed of thousands of nodes around the globe running the bitcoin software (although the number might be decreasing). It is hard to shut down because all of these nodes need to be shut down at once to derail the online currency.

Steven Zheng, a researcher at crypto publication The Block, focused his Harry Potter metaphor on the goal of bitcoin: giving users freedom to do as they please.

“Remember when Dobby was freed by a sock? Bitcoin is that sock,” he tweeted.

Dobby was a house elf in one of the Harry Potter books who desired nothing more than his freedom, but under the rules of Rowling’s world house elves must be slaves to their owners until they are presented with clothes.

A couple of other tweeters tried to describe bitcoin’s monetary policy by comparing it to the few financial elements scattered in a Harry Potter book.

“Imagine if Gringotts ran on the Floo network,” said Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati, referencing Gringotts, the sole bank in the wizarding world, and the Floo network, fireplaces that witches and wizards can use to transport themselves instantly to other places.

“Imagine digital gold Galleons, of which no Philosopher’s Stone could make more. In fact, there is a limited supply, and the only way to earn new Galleons is to compete in the facilitation of transactions using Galleons already in circulation. All without goblin central banks,” Lolli CTO and co-founder Matt Senter tweeted.

In short, bitcoin’s supply is fixed, and probably can’t be changed by any entity, as central banks are able to do around the world in attempts to spur the economy in times of crisis.

Even Tesla’s Elon Musk, who is frequently impersonated on Twitter for crypto giveaway scams, weighed in.

But despite these attempts to sway Rowling, some of the analogies may have been a bit too convoluted. “Now I don’t understand bitcoin,” one bitcoiner responded.

And Rowling herself seemed unimpressed by the explanations she received.

“People are now explaining Bitcoin to me, and honestly, it’s blah blah blah collectibles (My Little Pony?) blah blah blah computers (got one of those) blah blah blah crypto (sounds creepy) blah blah blah understand the risk (I don’t, though),” Rowling tweeted.",2020-05-15 21:29:12+00:00,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/spencer-dinwiddie-free-agency-rumors-bitcoin-fans/kvg9xr6y4eoa1orqdm32vcily,"Spencer Dinwiddie is trying to get fans to invest in him again.

This time, the Nets guard is asking them to put up a large (and highly specific) amount of money in Bitcoin as part of a GoFundMe campaign. The ""reward"" is that Dinwiddie will sign a one-year contract with a team of the fans' choosing when he becomes a free agent, which could happen as early as July 2021.

That's quite the flex by Dinwiddie in assuming any team would take him. He has been a fine player for Brooklyn, but could, say, the Clippers make cap room for him? But that's getting way ahead of ourselves. First, the fans need to come up with a huge bag: $24,632,630 (or 2625.8 BTC).

As they like to say on Twitter, we have questions. Let's start with these four: Why $24,632,630? Why now, when the league is bracing for big revenue dips into 2021? Would the league even allow it? Why do it at all?

Dinwiddie offered some answers in a statement posted by Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium:

Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie (@SDinwiddie_25) says he will sign a one-year deal with the NBA team fans decide if they reach Bitcoin target of roughly $24,632,630 on a GoFundMe. Dinwiddie’s statement: pic.twitter.com/oebwkoFBEO — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) May 16, 2020

Dinwiddie has kept a sharp eye on Bitcoin and blockchain technology over the past several years, as he described in a clip posted on Coindesk.com's Twitter feed. He was listed as a speaker at Consensus: Distributed, a five-day cryptocurrency and blockchain seminar that ended Friday.

The answer to the NBA question is ""Maybe, but with reservations.""

The league took a dim view of Dinwiddie's other crypto-based product last fall: Investors would purchase up to 90 SD8 coins totaling about $13.5 million (or about $150,000 per coin) as a business loan. That total is more than his $10.6 million salary for this season, the first in a three-year, $34.4 million contract.

The NBA's main issue, according to Forbes.com in January, was that Dinwiddie was dangling the possibility of investors scoring big if he were to opt out of the third year of the contract ($12.3 million) next July and receive a big bump in salary in his next contract. Dinwiddie told Forbes the NBA threatened to terminate his contract over that.

""Pretty much what they said was that the player option was gambling, and that would’ve been cause for termination,"" Dinwiddie told Forbes' Shlomo Sprung. Dinwiddie eventually withdrew the player option portion in exchange for being able to go through with the initial offering.

As reported by 9News Australia, detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Cybercrime Squad charged the unnamed woman after conducting a search of her car outside a shopping center in Burwood, Sydney, on Thursday and discovering AU$60,000 (US$38,736) in cash and 3.8 bitcoin on a hard wallet device.

The chief of the Cybercrime Squad, Detective Superintendent Matt Craft, said it was the first arrest by the team relating to “non-compliant digital currency providers” in the state, and may be the first of its kind in Australia, as per the report.

“This will be the first of many arrests I believe we will make over the coming years and you’re being put on notice,” Craft said, presumably addressing others conducting unlawful cryptocurrency sales.

The arrest followed a string of enquiries made by the cybercrime unit’s Strike Force Kerriwah, which was set up in late 2018 to investigate online money-laundering operations in NSW. The woman, in her 50s, is believed to be involved in a crypto money-laundering syndicate, according to the report.

Investigators with the strike force also seized cryptocurrency wallets with a further AU$18,200 (US$11,749) in bitcoin along with digital storage devices, computers and mobile phones while searching a residential property in Hurtsville, also in Sydney, just after the woman was arrested.

The investigation was in collaboration with AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC).

The woman has been charged with three counts of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and breaching requirement relating to digital currency exchange services. Police said it will be alleged in court the woman has transacted bitcoin valued at more than AU$5 million (US$3.22 million) since 2017.",2020-05-15 10:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-mco-visa-card-european-union,"Crypto.com said Friday it has begun shipping its crypto-to-fiat card, the MCO Visa, across the European Union.

This Crypto Trading App Is a Scam

A bitcoin investment scheme claiming to help people make over $13,000 within 24 hours has recently gained more attention. Bitcoin Loophole claims to be an algorithmic crypto trading app that enables its members to make daily profits and become millionaires within 61 days. However, it is a scam associated with a different kind of investment.

Bitcoin Loophole: Crypto Trading App Scam

The record-high unemployment in many countries, led by the coronavirus crisis, has forced many people to look for jobs or ways to make money online. Investment schemes preying on the desperation to make fast cash have multiplied, many of which advertise investments in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies since they have recently outperformed most asset classes.

One bitcoin investment scheme that has recently garnered attention worldwide is called Bitcoin Loophole. Its simple website resembles other known bitcoin investment scams that news.Bitcoin.com has already exposed, such as Bitcoin Trader, Bitcoin Superstar, Bitcoin Era, Bitcoin Revolution, and Bitcoin Evolution.

Bitcoin Loophole claims to be an algorithmic trading software for cryptocurrency markets that can be automated so “There is no investor intervention required,” its website details. You can “make money using the official crypto trading software,” which is AI integrated and uses “advanced technology,” it adds.

Besides BTC, the Bitcoin Loophole website advertises that members can also trade in a number of other cryptocurrencies — including ethereum, litecoin, ripple, monero, bitcoin cash, and dash — as well as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and the euro. The self-proclaimed crypto trading app also states that its members “generally make a minimum of $13,000 every single day,” adding that “Little actual work is required” and “some members become millionaires within their first 61-days.” It additionally claims:

It is practically impossible to lose money when trading with Bitcoin Loophole.

In addition, the Bitcoin Loophole website also displays a number of testimonials supposedly from members who have successfully made money using this trading app. These testimonials are fake and the photos of members are merely stock photos publicly available online. The Bitcoin Loophole app is also available in the Google Play store.

What’s the Catch?

While the idea of making $13,000 a day with little effort is attention-grabbing, there are many red flags about Bitcoin Loophole. News.Bitcoin.com created an account at Bitcoin Loophole for this review. Once we completed signing up, the following message displayed in the middle of the screen: “You’ve successfully completed the registration and connected to your broker.” Another message then asked us to deposit funds of at least $250 into the account to begin trading. All deposits must be done via credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Maestro, and American Express.

There was a world of difference in the information and tone that the website displays before and after signing into the site. Once logged in, there are no longer any promises of easy profits from bitcoin. Instead, there is a disclaimer that reads:

Bitcoin Loophole does not accept any liability for loss or damage as a result of reliance on the information contained within this website.

Another red flag is that before logging in, the website expressly states that it is not a scam and its app is “an award-winning software.” Furthermore, the so-called trading app claims that it “has been acknowledged by major institutions such as the US Trading Association as the best trading tool for cryptocurrency investors.” This is, of course, not true as the company is not registered with any regulators and its app is not recognized by any authorities.

After signing in, the website also displays a notice specifically about U.S. customers. It states: “USA Regulation Notice: Option trading is not regulated within the United States. Bitcoin Loophole is not supervised or regulated by any financial agencies nor US agencies. Any unregulated trading activity by U.S. residents is considered unlawful. Bitcoin Loophole does not accept customers located within the United States or holding an American citizenship.” This disclosure is false as options trading is regulated in the U.S. by the Commodity and Exchange Commission (CFTC).

Bait-and-Switch: CFD Trading Not Bitcoin Trading

After logging into the Bitcoin Loophole website, there is no longer any mention of bitcoin but there are plenty of mentions of contract for difference (CFD) trading. Trading contracts for difference is a way of speculating on financial markets that does not require the buying and selling of any underlying assets.

Based on information displayed on the website after logging in, Bitcoin Loophole looks more like a CFD scam with no element of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies other than its name. It may also be a shady affiliate or referral website for an offshore CFD broker, in the same way Bitcoin Evolution does for a Cyprus-registered investment company. CFDs are high-risk investments and companies often pay huge commissions for client referrals for CFD trading. The Bitcoin Loophole website (after logging in) even has a disclaimer that states: “You may lose some or all of your invested capital, therefore you should not speculate with capital that you cannot afford to lose.”

Many scams have been known to target CFD trading specifically and many authorities have advised how to recognize one. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) warns:

If you are solicited by a company that claims to trade in CFDs and asks you to invest funds, you should be very careful … Get rich schemes, including those involving CFDs, tend to be scams.

The association advised that these scams are “heavily promoted” as an “exciting opportunity” to make money, promising high returns and guaranteeing “little or no risk and high investment returns.” As Bitcoin Loophole did, these scammers would “encourage you to wire your money offshore,” the NASAA detailed. “Be aware that once you transfer funds to a foreign firm, it may be difficult or impossible to get your money back.”

Since scams using the words bitcoin and cryptocurrency have become more rampant, anyone searching for an investment opportunity online should take extreme caution. If you are looking for a legit way to start investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.com has many useful guides to get you started, including how to buy and sell bitcoin.

Despite being dubbed the “lifeline of the Ethereum network,” gas is an obscure term outside of the Ethereum community. While it is often used to describe transaction fees on the network, really understanding gas requires diving a bit deeper into the mechanics of Ethereum.

Gas and Smart Contracts

ConsenSys defines gas as a “metering unit for use of the World Computer,” but it boils down to an even simpler explanation—the fee for using this world computer.

That said, it’s worth noting a few significant differences. Gas represents much more than just the cost of processing transactions on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is capable of running all sorts of apps, allowing it to form the basis of the decentralized web. As such, while gas could technically be described as “transaction fees,” it should be used with caution.

The Ethereum Yellow Paper, written by one of the network’s creators, Gavin Wood, lists precisely how much a specific instruction on the network costs in gas:

Every type of instruction performed on the network has its own fixed price. To figure out the cost of a transaction or smart contract, simply add up the value of every instruction it performs.

The problems, however, arise when the gas fee actually has to get paid.

The term that best describes gas is fuel for the Ethereum network. But fuel isn’t a currency on its own, it needs to be bought and denominated in dollars or euros.

The same goes for gas. For it to be paid, it needs to have its value expressed in Ether, the underlying cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. Like oil, there is no fixed price to convert gas to Ether. It’s left to buyers and sellers (miners) to come up with a price suitable to both sides. This pricing is achieved through a virtual auction.

How Gas Works on the Ethereum Network

For an instruction to execute on the Ethereum network, the sender of the transaction needs to specify a “gas limit” before submitting it to the network. The gas limit is the maximum amount someone is willing to pay for their instructions to go through and get processed.

The processors of these transactions, server operators, known as miners, have a few choices when they receive a pending transaction. First, they can accept the transaction by processing the instructions with their computers, using electricity in the process, and keep the attached fee set by the sender. They can also refund some of the gas to the sender if the sender set a higher gas limit than was necessary for the transaction. Alternatively, they can decline the transaction if the sender set a lower gas limit than what the market was paying at the time.

If a transaction’s instructions, mid-execution, run out of gas as a miner is processing it then it is “reverted back to its original state.” In other words, the transaction is returned to the sender. Nevertheless, the sender must still pay a fee to miners to compensate them for the computing power they spent processing the transaction, even if it was only partially completed. Miners must also add the transaction to the blockchain, even if it wasn’t fully executed. If the sender specifies a higher gas limit than was necessary, then the miner would refund the difference to the sender.

While this mechanism has been widely praised for the way it handles transactions, it is prone to complications in reality.

The problem is especially acute for transactions with high gas limits. For Bitcoin and other payment-focused blockchains, paying more usually means that transactions get sent faster. This isn’t always the case with Ethereum. For each block on the Ethereum network, miners are bound by the maximum “block gas limit,” which determines the maximum amount of gas that can be spent per block.

With the current block gas limit set at roughly 10,000,000 gas, miners are less inclined to include transactions with high gas limits because it would waste part of the block gas limit. For these high gas transactions, much of it will usually get refunded by the miner. Instead, miners opt to take smaller transactions.

For example, it makes more economic sense for miners to include two separate transactions with gas limits set at 21,000 gas than one transaction with a gas limit of 42,000 gas.

The Problem with Fees

For Ethereum to work as a world computer, fees on the network need to be minuscule. As such, the way to pay for these transactions, Ether, also needs to be denominated in minuscule amounts.

To keep track of fees, Ether is denominated in several smaller increments, the most widely used one being the gwei. Also called nanoether, gwei denotes the ninth power of a fractional Ether—1 gwei equals 0.000000001 ether (10^-9).

There are other denominations of Ether as well, all named after influential figures in the world of cryptography. None of them, however, are as widely used or as recognized as gwei.

How to Calculate Ethereum Transaction Fees

There are several ways to calculate the fee necessary to execute a transaction on the Ethereum network. The network is set up in such a way that any arbitrary fee can be set. So, in theory, a sender could select any number as the transaction fee they’re willing to pay, no matter how minuscule (well, as low as one gwei).

It doesn’t work that way in reality since miners are still motivated by fees.

There are dozens of gas calculators available online that allow aspiring Ethereum users to get a general idea of how much gas their transaction will need. We recommend ETH Gas Station for its intuitive interface and accuracy.

At press time, it would cost 23 gwei, or around $0.091, to send a transaction in under 5 minutes. To send a transaction in under 2 minutes, it would cost 34 gwei, or about $0.135.

That said, these recommended prices are only estimates. Whatever the gas price, there is still an element of uncertainty. A 21,000 gas transaction with its gas price set at 35 gwei was accepted by 97% of the last 200 blocks (30 minutes or so). The average time for a transaction with these characteristics to get confirmed on the network was 21 seconds, according to the calculator.

Even so, it’s possible to determine transaction fees on the Ethereum network without an online calculator. A prospective sender just needs to know how much gas each operation on Ethereum requires, and then have a basic understanding of the average market rate for gas prices.

For example, a simple token transfer on the Ethereum network requires 21,000 gas to complete. The third week of April saw an average gas price of around 20 gwei. Therefore, calculating the transaction fee requires multiplying the required gas units with the going gas price.

21,000 gas x 6 gwei = 126,000 gwei = 0.000126 ETH

At current prices, a user sending a 21,000 token transfer will pay a gas fee of $0.021 for the network to process and validate it.

Problems With Ethereum’s Auction Mechanism

Ethereum uses the “first price auction” system to price gas. The system works by having every sender submit a bid, known as a gas limit, for how much they’re willing to pay. Miners then pick up desirable transactions and include them in the next block. In theory, this allows senders to prioritize their transactions by paying a higher fee while saving ETH through refunds. In reality, this mechanism has serious flaws.

What usually happens is that miners select transactions with the highest bids, causing senders to set even higher bids on other transactions they make. There is also a problem of transparency. There is no way for someone to know what bids came with other pending transactions, which also results in overpaying.

Eric Conner, the founder of Ethhub, an open-source education hub for Ethereum, noted that there is often a considerable divergence of transaction fees paid by different senders in a single block. Conner suggests that many users often overpay by more than five times what was necessary, according to his data.

Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) number 1559 addresses this problem by proposing a base fee on the network. The EIP, called BASEFEE, would then adjust this figure depending on how congested the network is.

The currently used auction mechanism doesn’t take into consideration the demand for the network, which has led to severe congestion. In some cases, this has even caused the Ethereum network to grind to a standstill for some applications.

To make a system such as BASEFEE work, the maximum gas capacity of a block would need to double from 10 million to 20 million. That way, the block gas limit could adjust dynamically. For example, if the network were at 50% utilization, an average load, the new system would set the block gas limit to 10 million.

Conner suggests that when more than 50% of the network is utilized, the base fee increases, and vice versa. This, he explained, will allow wallets to automatically set the gas fees for users in a reliable fashion, effectively removing the need for manual fee adjustments.

The most notable aspect of this proposal is that miners would no longer be able to profit from fees. BASEFEE proposes that fees are destroyed rather than given to miners, forcing miners to earn revenue through block rewards alone (about $3.5 million per day split between all miners). Destroying fees would prevent miners from manipulating transactions to get more money from senders. It would also ensure that only Ether could be used to pay for transactions, cementing its value.

Miners would instead profit from “tips,” small fixed amounts of money set by wallets to compensate them. A higher tip will ensure faster settling times, but it won’t lead to involuntary over-payment, as is often the case with the current system.

Many expect this update will find its place in Ethereum’s upcoming iteration, Ethereum 2.0, which will bring about staking and drastically increase Ether’s economic value within the network.",2020-05-16 09:56:49+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-you-could-save-money-when-reporting-crypto-taxes,"Many crypto holders are reporting their crypto transactions for the first time as a result of the United States Internal Revenue Service’s question about “virtual currency” on the 2019 tax return form.

It is a big question for some taxpayers — many have not reported their crypto gains in the past or may have done so without a great deal of precision. Should a taxpayer let bygones be bygones or file an amended return to accurately reflect their historical income from crypto? The IRS subpoenas of crypto exchanges for taxpayers’ trading histories certainly raise the stakes. To layer more on, statutes of limitations, potential penalties and/or IRS leniency may vary based on the degree of previous noncompliance.

Related: IRS Crypto Tax Return Question — Be Careful How You Answer

Decisions in one tax year have consequences in future years. This is because gain/loss amounts vary based on which crypto assets are treated as purchased or sold and when these trades occur. Sale of an asset in one year raises the question of how or when a taxpayer acquired that specific asset in the past. If an acquisition was the fruit of mining, staking or an airdrop that was not reported, a taxpayer may need to explain why this transaction was not reported as income on their previous year’s tax return.

Given the recent changes and uncertainties, new software has been designed for investors, traders and other participants in the crypto ecosystem. Such tax compliance software is necessary because, unlike traditional financial assets, trading and other activities in crypto are not reliably reported — or often not at all — on IRS information returns (such as 1099 forms).

Trading in cryptocurrency differs from trading in traditional financial assets in a variety of ways. This includes the movement of taxpayer assets across exchanges in nontaxable transactions, paying fees in capital assets (rather than cash), differing tickers from one exchange to the next, decimal precision and the unique transactions that only occur in the cryptosphere. These are some of the reasons why traditional or generic tax compliance software often falls short in serving the crypto ecosystem.

However, not all crypto tax software is created equal:

Some ignore fees associated with transacting in crypto that typically leads to an overpayment of tax on gains or an understatement of losses — which can be used to offset taxable gains. It’s important for your software to properly account for transaction fees so your taxable income is not overstated. Some do not properly address the uniqueness of crypto data, such as the differing tickers across exchanges for the same asset and varying decimal precision. Mistakes in these two areas can lead to inaccurate taxable income calculations and risk of an audit. Some do not provide sufficient flexibility for the particular taxpayer’s circumstances or blindly apply imprecise or generic tax principles. This rigidity can have adverse financial consequences for taxpayers in the absence of detailed IRS guidance. One example is the reporting of airdrops, mining and staking rewards where some taxpayers believe the IRS’s guidance is too broad when applied to different factual variations. Another example involves the potential for claiming ordinary, rather than capital, loss treatment for certain crypto assets. Ordinary losses are often easier to use for reducing taxable income. Some offer taxpayers accounting methods for crypto that are impermissible in the United States — e.g., average cost — without adequate warnings. Others do not support or display the benefits of tax optimizing methods that allow taxpayers to identify assets with the highest tax bases as the ones sold, a method known as highest-in, first-out. Some only match acquisitions and dispositions on a single exchange rather than across all of a taxpayer’s different trading venues. This can have a material impact on taxable income calculations. Generally, this will also result in non-optimal taxable income calculations when applying different accounting methods such as first-in, first-out, last-in, first-out and highest-in, first-out. Some were developed in a vacuum and not subject to the rigors of independent audits for Service Organization Controls relevant to software-as-a-service providers. Only crypto software providers with the highest level of internal controls for reporting, security, privacy and processing have both SOC 1, Type 2, and SOC 2, Type 2 certifications. The use of software without these certifications increases a taxpayer’s risks — both tax and non-tax related.

The list goes on, and there are even more points that can be made in choosing the right crypto tax software for an area where there is little specific tax guidance. The lack of specific guidance for crypto does not mean that there are no rules, however. It just means that a finer-tooth comb is needed to determine which tax rules apply to crypto, and how that application differs from traditional financial assets.

There can be advantages to such an analysis that can significantly reduce tax expenses or increase a taxpayer’s refund. A flexible tool is often needed to help users make informed decisions that can ultimately save taxes or increase a refund.

@ jasonpeckham Jason Peckham Analyst at Invictus Capital

Margin trading magnifies the market’s every move. Leverage intensifies the trading experience and captivates our inner risk-taker. It’s either moon or gloom. We are lured in, naturally focusing on the upside potential. As volumes grow along with increasing crypto-optimism, demand for leveraged exposure is rising.

The surge in traders’ demand for additional capital is met by margin lending. Peer-to-peer markets enable lenders to earn interest on their capital by offering short-term loans. While this side of the market may be less alluring, it offers significant returns. This article explores the opportunity for crypto investors to earn steady gains through margin lending.

An Inconvenient Truth about Trading

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over 90% of traders end up losing money. This implies that entry-level “trading education” is misleading. The false promise of profits leads traders in before they fully understand the market. They pay their own school fees, in the form of trading losses, until they learn to beat the market.

Profitable traders develop strategies that are back-tested and optimized for success. While this alone does not guarantee success, a trading system means being able to select setups which are expected to have a positive outcome. In contrast, without data to support their trades, most new traders act on the whims of their emotions. They play a risky game blind.

Fortunately for investors, the growing cryptocurrency sector offers niches for wealth creation with lower risk.

Lending Completes the Margin Ecosystem

Margin facilities are valuable to traders. Using their funds as collateral, they can increase exposure. Liquidity is improved, with only a portion of their funds required on the exchange. Given these benefits and the high-stakes nature of margin trading, traders are willing to pay relatively high interest for short-term capital loans.

In traditional markets, institutional brokerages are the loan providers. Given their absence from the crypto equivalent, this presents an opportunity. Through peer-to-peer lending, private lenders can gain access to the low-risk returns typically only enjoyed by the richest 1%.

But how low is that risk anyways? A key factor makes crypto margin lending different from the traditional version. When a trader’s losses exceed their collateral, they receive a dreaded margin call: either they deposit extra collateral, or else the position is closed. In crypto, however, the margin call is no call at all. A trader’s position is automatically closed if losses consume their collateral. This relies on a matching engine which liquidates positions to protect lenders. The result is an interest-earning margin lending market with minimal risk of losses.

A Lower Risk Addition to Crypto Portfolios

While being one of the lesser known crypto markets, high-yield lending opportunities are, of course, well contested. High-interest offers are snapped up, with only spoof orders left behind to trick competitors. This is an increasingly difficult market for small or inexperienced traders to come out on top, but the emergence of margin lending funds offers investors a passive solution to earn double-digit returns.

As a result, the high-yield frontier remains with peer-to-peer margin lending, a market which benefits from volatility regardless of direction. As price volatility increases the demand for margin loans, lending rates surge, with some traders paying an annualized rate of over 20% for short-term loans.

Margin trading continues to dominate the conversation around high-yield crypto returns, but investors can benefit from exploring the wider range of options that the maturing cryptocurrency sector offers. Here they will find the reliable returns with lower risk that are sorely missed from crypto portfolios.

There was a time when any Tom, Dick or Harry could create (or “mine”) bitcoin with a modified PC. Now only warehouses packed full of specialised computing gear stand any real chance. The bones of defunct crypto mines litter the Swiss Alps.

This week saw a special event in the bitcoin life cycle, called “Halving”. Like a super-rapid solar eclipse, blink and you missed it. So what happened?

Bitcoin is produced as a reward for “miners” (those warehouses of souped-up PCs) who create blocks of bitcoin transactions. The total supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million, programmed to emerge at a regular pace until the year 2140.

Part of the bitcoin supply equation involves slowing down production over time. Every few years, the bitcoin reward that miners receive is slashed in half. Last week they got 12.5 bitcoin for producing a block of data, halfway through this week it became 6.25.

Bitcoin mining is a competitive vocation. It uses a lot of electricity. That produces heat. A location with low electricity bills and a cool climate gives a competitive edge.

Some people thought that might be Switzerland. They were wrong.

Around four years ago a crypto mine called AlpEreum popped up near a hydro-electric dam in central Switzerland. It found it could not compete with mines in China, Iceland and the US.

A couple of years later, another mine set up in a small village called Gondo, right on the Italian border. Gondo was big into gold mining in previous centuries and was a popular border crossing for smugglers. Then it suffered a devastating landslide and the young folk started to move out.

Alpine Mining said it would restore Gondo’s fortunes with the latest high-tech mining operation – this time for cryptocurrencies. It proved an irresistible story, so I went along to check it out. But that project was also unprofitable. Alpine Mining is still in Gondo, but more in the field of crypto and artificial intelligence research.

Around the same time, an outfit called Unity Investment (it also operates under the name Unicrypt) tried to set up a mining warehouse near to Zurich. In March, the company announced it was moving the facility to New York to take advantage of cheaper electricity bills.

One German outfit, Envion, moved to Switzerland and ran into an acrimonious legal dispute between the founders and CEO. Another eco-friendly mobile mining operation, Swiss Alps Mining, had the idea of occupying deserted alpine hiking huts. The operation appears to be still running, so if any alpine walker runs into one of these pods then please let me know.

Miners return

But the story doesn’t end there for crypto mining in Switzerland, thanks to the emergence of financial derivatives around the likes of bitcoin. This is where Switzerland’s financial know-how could give it an edge. Numerous Swiss firms are springing up with the intention of occupying this space.

Chinese mining giant, Bitmain, once set up ancillary operations in Zurich, but had to close down. In its place came the firm Matrixport, with links to Bitmain, offering financial services.

Now one of the world’s largest mining pools (cooperatives of several mining outfits), called Poolin, is eyeing up Switzerland from across the border at its European HQ in Berlin. Poolin creates around 18% of all bitcoin mined every day (plus a range of other cryptocurrencies), according to Vice-President Alejandro De La Torre. It wants to put this stockpile to good use. Switzerland’s crypto financial service industry looks an attractive option.

“Switzerland has a strong banking tradition and we are exploring the idea of expanding our operation into financial services,” he said. “We also have a lot of contacts in the Swiss Crypto Valley.” Right now, there are no concrete plans to report, but watch this space.

CoinFlip Preferred is an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading platform that aims to make cryptocurrency investments more accessible through lower minimum transaction sizes.

It is actually one of the pioneers of Bitcoin (BTC) ATM services in the U.S.

CoinFlip Preferred Provides Excellent Pricing and Rapid Trade Execution with CoinFlip's Trademark Customer Service#CoinFlipOTC Start trading today! https://t.co/nMaSEiY8GL — CoinFlip Preferred (OTC) (@coinflipotc) May 13, 2020

To offer “easier access” to the crypto trading market

Compared with other crypto OTC trading platforms, CoinFlip Preferred provides an investment opportunity for customers at a low transaction size of only US$5,000[AU$7,795].

The project’s aim is to make high-end, crypto investment markets more inclusive. Stockhouse quotes chief executive officer of CoinFlip, Daniel Polotsky:

“Our mission has always been to help regular people build their wealth by demystifying cryptocurrencies and giving them easier access to these burgeoning markets.”

CoinFlip Preferred makes the exchange of the most popular cryptocurrencies, like BTC, Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), accessible to its users. As said in their press release, they plan on adding more cryptocurrencies in the future.

The platform will take advantage of 600 ATMs that CoinFlip has already placed nationwide.

Also with the help of the ecosystem that CoinFlip has developed in the business of selling cryptocurrencies, they believe that they can “offer excellent pricing” and “rapid execution of trades” for CoinFlip Preferred’s clients.

In the press release, Polotsky expressed:

“Combined with our fast-growing network of ATMs, which give users convenient self-service options for transactions under $12,000, CoinFlip Preferred now allows us to support our customers making trades of any dollar amount.”

Users can begin trading as soon as they sign up. When they register, they also get their own personal concierge who will guide them throughout the whole investment process.

For additional guidance, users can get in touch with consultants every day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. CT.

Further expansion discussed if international demand grows

CoinFlip Preferred is only available in the U.S., as of its launch. Nevertheless, as mentioned on the press release, CoinFlip is planning to expand it internationally if the demand calls for it.

At the moment, CoinFlip’s pioneering project is its ATM network available in 34 states. Because these machines are the same access points for CoinFlip Preferred, they are expecting that users can now conveniently make cryptocurrency investments.

As Polotsky said, this new platform will make high-end investment opportunities available to the approximately 25% of Americans who are “unbanked” or “underbanked.”

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has become inundated with bitcoin insight and cryptocurrency explanations when she tweeted asking someone to explain to her what bitcoin was. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was among those trying to explain bitcoin to Rowling. He believes that bitcoin is “solid” compared to governments’ fiat money.

JK Rowling Wants to Understand Bitcoin

British author J.K. Rowling, famed for writing the Harry Potter book series, tweeted on Friday: “I don’t understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me.” Her query, which had been retweeted about 2,400 times and liked about 9,400 times at the time of this writing, has drawn tons of responses from the crypto industry. Rowling’s Harry Potter series has sold more than 500 million copies and was adapted into a film franchise.

Comments immediately flooded the Twitter thread after Rowling tweeted as crypto enthusiasts seized this unique opportunity to explain bitcoin and cryptocurrency to the famous author and her 14.6 million followers. Some people provided their own explanations while others linked to well-known work, books, or articles online. Several people even custom-made videos to explain bitcoin and its benefits to her.

Among responders to Rowling’s request was Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. He described: “It’s a digital currency. There’s ~18m units of it. It’s not backed by anything, it’s just valuable because it is, like collectibles … There’s a network of computers (which anyone can join) that maintains a decentralized global excel spreadsheet of how many coins each person has.” Noting that “People find it interesting because there is no central authority that controls this network, so there’s no single group of people that can just go and issue more units to their friends or manipulate its rules for political reasons,” Buterin elaborated:

Basically global digital payments, plus the store of value properties of gold, all with 21st century cryptographic tech to keep the whole thing running safely.

The Twitter account for Gemini, the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, tweeted: “Contrary to popular belief bitcoin is not ‘magic’ money.” There was also a discussion of what bitcoin fixes and Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song briefly asserted:

Money is broken. Bitcoin is the fix.

Song included a link to “The Little Bitcoin Book: Why Bitcoin Matters for Your Freedom, Finances, and Future” on Amazon. Some people saw Rowling’s request as an opportunity to promote their work, such as The Bitcoin Standard’s author, Saifedean Ammous, who told Rowling that he would be “Happy to mail you a copy of my book JK.”

Tron founder Justin Sun quickly offered 1 BTC to Rowling: “I can send you 1 bitcoin. Seeing is believing … Just imagine a magic coin (bitcoin) Dumbledore don’t understand (like Warren Buffett) but Harry Potter is fascinated about it.” Sun and a small group of people in the crypto industry recently had lunch with the Berkshire Hathaway CEO after winning it at a charity for $4.57 million. The Tron founder also gifted Buffett 1 BTC but the billionaire passed it onto a charity. Sun was also recently rumored to have received a $2 million grant from the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program, which is part of the coronavirus stimulus package that President Donald Trump signed into law in March.

Some other examples of the responses Rowling received include “Bitcoin is like fire insurance you’d buy for your home but instead of your home on fire, it’s economic & government systems around the world” and “Imagine that something exists which doesn’t actually exist. That’s Bitcoin.” Some explained bitcoin as “Digital money that cannot be tampered with. Doesn’t require Banks to send it. Bitcoin has a finite supply, therefore is not subject to inflation like $/£” and “Imagine money is like alcohol. Everyday more and more is being printed so it constantly dilutes the alcohol. Bitcoin is like the purest form of alcohol that cannot ever be diluted. You can enjoy the same taste 5, 10, or 100 years down the line.” One Twitter user wrote:

Bitcoin is designed so that it eliminates the need for trust. It’s backed by advanced math, you won’t understand.

JK Rowling Still Confused About Bitcoin, Elon Musk Explained Bitcoin Is ‘Solid’

After many people attempted to explain bitcoin to Rowling, she was still confused. “God bless every single one of you now earnestly explaining bitcoin to me as though I’ll grasp it if you break it down properly. Things like this are white noise to me,” Rowling admitted. “I cannot and will not ever understand Bitcoin, but I love you for thinking that I can or will.”

Among those who tried to explain the concept of bitcoin and cryptocurrency to Rowling was Elon Musk. The Tesla and Spacex CEO wrote, “Massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison.” He added, “I still only own 0.25 bitcoins btw.” Musk recently criticized the U.S. government’s stimulus relief plans and also came under fire himself when he said the Tesla stock price was “too high,” which immediately sent the price downward.

Paxful CEO Ray Youssef chimed in. He wrote: “It is true Ms. Rowling bitcoin doesn’t add value to your life. It may however add value to those around you who help you with services. So many of them send money back home and bitcoin used for p2p can save them so much time and money.”

Some people believe that Rowling was just upset that she did not get into bitcoin while its price was lower. Ivan on Tech speculated: “Maybe JK Rowling is just jealous that she didn’t buy bitcoin early enough and missed out on massive gains … Now she is trying to spread FUD to bring back the price.”

Rowling later admitted: “This started as a joke, but now I’m afraid I’ll never be able to log in to Twitter again without someone getting angry I don’t own bitcoin. One day you’ll see a wizened old woman in the street, trying to trade a Harry Potter book for a potato. Be kind. She did try to understand.” She noted that she is “just about able to grasp a barter system. Talk of collectibles, tokenomics and blockchains and my brain just takes a walk.” The famous author opined:

I’m sure cryptocurrencies are fascinating. I’ve genuinely tried to grasp the very detailed information I’ve been sent tonight (people close to me understand it & have tried to explain it when I’m stone cold sober), but I’m afraid this is a total blind spot to me.

Does JK Rowling Own Any Bitcoin Right Now?

After several hours of tweetstorm in response to the Harry Potter author’s quest to understand bitcoin, fake JK Rowling Twitter accounts started to actively participate in the discussion.

One tweet from an account impersonating Rowling reads, “Ok Ok Ok. You guys win. I just bought my first bitcoin.” This tweet has since been deleted but not before it was seen by many people, including Rowling herself who acknowledged, “a fake JK Rowling account has made a purchase of bitcoin.”

While most people just ignored the fake account, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong replied to it seriously. “Welcome to crypto,” Armstrong wrote. “Grab a Coinbase account when you’re ready to use that bitcoin (not just hold it), and get into any of the many other cryptos out there.” Rowling confirmed on Saturday morning:

In case I haven’t effectively demonstrated my ignorance between last night & this morning, I don’t own bitcoin.

Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Luno, pointed out that “this is a good reminder for us all on how much work there is still to do to educate on bitcoin … People can criticize JK Rowling all they like but 1. she is making a genuine effort to understand and 2. is a good proxy for the general population.”

A number of people in the crypto space have created bitcoin explainer videos for Rowling. Girl Gone Crypto, for example, made a Harry Potter-themed video specifically for Rowling called “Muggle’s Guide to Bitcoin.” Ethereum co-founder and creator of Cardano Charles Hoskinson made a Youtube video entitled “What is Bitcoin for JK Rowling” and urged others to make a similar effort to explain the concept of cryptocurrency for those who may be interested in learning more. Bitcoin.com also has a wide range of educational resources for anyone looking to learn about bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Whether JK Rowling decides to buy bitcoin or not, the crypto community has viewed her quest to understand bitcoin as a great awareness drive for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the very least, she has tweeted multiple times about bitcoin to her 14.6 million Twitter followers.

Lend your crypto and earn as much as 12% interest, or borrow against your crypto for quick cash. Here are the top five crypto lending and borrowing services.

By borrowing money through a crypto loan service, you can get quick access to cash or additional crypto. You won’t need to sell off your long-term crypto holdings, either, helping avoid short-term capital gains taxes.

The opportunity goes both ways: by lending out your cryptocurrency to a loan service, you can earn competitive interest on your holdings. Some services offer as much as 8% interest on Bitcoin and 12% interest on stablecoins annually.

Each crypto loan service offers different interest rates, terms and conditions, and loan-to-value rates, meaning that you should examine the options carefully before making a decision on which service to use.

Crypto.com

Crypto.com is a leading blockchain payment company, best known for its payment card and mobile app. The company originated in 2016 as Monaco and rebranded under its current name in 2018. You can borrow crypto through Crypto.com’s Credit feature or earn interest through its Earn feature.

Borrowing Lending LTV ratio* 50% N/A Interest rate** 8-12% p.a. 4-12% p.a. Minimum amount $100 $250 Contract length 12 months Flexible, 1-month, or 3-months Currency accepted BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, MCO/CRO BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, and 20 others Currency paid out Stablecoins (PAX, TUSD, USDC, USDT) Same as deposited crypto Availability Borrowing available in most of Europe. Lending available in the United States, Europe, and Singapore. Special token Yes, MCO token needed for the best rates Interface Mobile app, with payment features

Celsius Network

Celsius Network was founded in 2017 to provide “financial freedom, economic opportunity, and income equality.” It intends to serve as an alternative to big banks and financial institutions.

You can borrow cash and stablecoins through Celsius’ Cash Loans page or earn interest through its Earn Crypto page.

Borrowing Lending LTV ratio* 25%; 33%, 50% N/A Interest rate** 3.46%-8.95% APR 1.5%-11% APY Minimum amount $1,000 No minimum Contract length 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years None Currency accepted BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC, DASH, EOS BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC, CEL +20 others Currency paid out Dollars (cash) or stablecoins Same as deposit or CEL token Other claims No withdrawal fees, termination fees, or default fees; gives 80% of revenue back to community Availability Worldwide, excluding Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Lebanon, and some U.S. states Special token Yes, CEL token needed for the best rates Interface Mobile app, with payment features

BlockFi

BlockFi aims to “redefine banking” by bridging traditional finance with the blockchain industry. In addition to serving as a lending service, BlockFi also offers special services to financial institutions.

You can borrow crypto through BlockFi’s Crypto Loans feature and lend money through the BlockFi Interest Account (BIA).

Borrowing Lending LTV ratio* Up to 50% N/A Interest rate** 4.5%-9.75% APR 3.2%-8.6% APY Minimum amount $5,000 No minimum Contract length 12 months 1 month (without withdrawal penalty) Currency accepted BTC, ETH, LTC BTC, ETH, LTC, USDC, GUSD, PAX, and wired funds Currency paid out USD (cash) Chosen currency (“Payment Flex”) Other claims Some fees; relies on Gemini as custodian; institutional backing from Coinbase, Galaxy Digital Availability Most countries and U.S. states, excluding New York, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria Special token No special token Interface Web interface, with general trading features

Nexo

Nexo is a crypto lending platform created by Credissimo, a long-standing consumer loan company. Though Nexo did not go live until 2018, Credissimo has existed since 2007.

You can borrow from Nexo by using its Instant Crypto Credit Line, or you can lend crypto through its Earn Interest page.

Borrowing Lending LTV ratio* 52% for BTC; 15%-90% for other assets N/A Interest rate** 5.9%-11.9% APR 8% interest per year Minimum amount $500 No minimum Contract length Unknown No minimum Currency accepted BTC, ETH, XRP, 20 other coins USD, EUR, GBP, stablecoins Currency paid out USD and other fiat currency Same as deposit Other claims Instant credit and spending, no minimum repayments, no hidden fees, assets secured by BitGo Availability Most countries and U.S. states; 16 countries specifically excluded Special token NEXO token optional, pays out dividends Interface Web interface and mobile app

Other Considerations

Crypto lending services are thriving, and every company listed above offers competitive rates and terms of service.

However, there are a few risks to consider. Since cryptocurrency prices fluctuate, lenders may not actually earn the promised amount in terms of dollar value. On the other hand, borrowers may have their deposits liquidated if prices fluctuate too much. A smaller but still quite real risk is that one of these crypto companies fail, causing depositors to lose everything.

It can also be challenging to get the rates advertised. Generally, by making large, long-term deposits in common coins like Bitcoin, you will get above-average rates. Meanwhile, stablecoins, like USD Coin and TrueUSD, tend to offer the highest rates. That said, many of the services above require depositors to use their particular cryptocurrency to get the best deal.

Finally, crypto borrowing services typically promise interest rates that are better than what a bank might offer. Banks, however, can offer even lower rates to borrowers with good credit scores, especially when property like a house or car are used as collateral, meaning that crypto loans are not always the least expensive option.

Ultimately, crypto lending and borrowing is an excellent service for those who already have a substantial investment in cryptocurrency or want to earn even higher returns on their investments.

We are about the experience “the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,” according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath. The coming economic downturn will be the result of the lockdown measures that were put into place by governments around the world to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.

As several central banks are switching on the printers in an attempt to stimulate the economy with a fresh round of quantitative easing, economic theory is brought into the forefront of public policy.

In this article, we discuss Modern Monetary Theory in today’s world and how Bitcoin (BTC) relates to it.

MMT explained

In a nutshell, Modern Monetary Theory, also known as Modern Money Theory or MMT, is an economic theory that suggests that governments that issue their own fiat currencies should print as much money as they need.

According to MMT, government spending is not constrained by funds coming from taxation and debt issuance. Instead, the contested economic theory suggests that governments can print as much money as they require for spending as they have a monopoly on the issuance of money.

Opponents of MMT highlight that “endless” money printing will lead to massive government debt and skyrocketing inflation.

MMT supporters, however, believe governments cannot default on their debt because they can print more money to pay for it. Additionally, they believe that inflation can be combatted with policy actions (such as taxation) and that it only really becomes an issue once “real resources” such as labor, capital, and natural resources have been fully exhausted.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, once famously said: “The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default.”

While this may sound preposterous, in a way, he was right. When the US government debt moved toward its “debt ceiling” in July 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 to increase the debt ceiling to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt obligations.

While the decision to increase the debt ceiling was not paired with throwing on the central bank’s printers, it showed the government’s ability to create its own rules that are seemingly above the laws of the free market. And printing more money is one of them.

MMT is making a comeback but not everyone’s a fan

Modern Monetary Theory is making a comeback with the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders proposing it as a viable solution to today’s economic woes.

Additionally, the recent US stimulus packages, which involve the Federal Reserve printing money in an attempt to bolster the economy, shows that - to a certain degree - MMT is part of the world of modern economics.

While economists love to argue about economic theory as much as Crypto Twitter loves to argue about everything, MMT has found its way into economic policy actions to some extent.

However, that does not mean that everyone’s a fan. The list of notable economists who oppose MMT is arguably longer than its list of supporters.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, for example, recently stated at a Senate hearing: “The idea that deficits don’t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong.”

Similar views are held by the likes of former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff, and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who all disagree with the notion that printing an infinite amount of money cannot harm the economy.

The often-cited, albeit extreme example of excessive money printing is Zimbabwe. When President Mugabe threw on the money printers in 2000, Zimbabwe eventually suffered from hyperinflation, which led to the downfall of the Zimbabwean dollar less than a decade later.

While you cannot compare the economy of Zimbabwe with that of the United States, this case is a reminder of what increasing the money supply can do to an economy if left unchecked.

Bitcoin vs. MMT

Whether you agree with Modern Monetary Theory or not, what is clear is that Bitcoin challenges this economic theory.

The world’s leading digital currency has a fixed money supply and a deflationary issuance model. Its total money supply cannot be increased by a central bank and its issuance model cannot be altered by government policy actions. This lies in stark contrast to the fiat currency system, which is largely driven by government intervention.

As most Bitcoiners prefer Austrian Economics, it should come as no surprise that MMT is not a big hit among Bitcoiners.

Bitcoiner and partner at Castle Island Ventures, Nic Carter, wrote in a blog post that MMT is “a delightfully accelerationist atrocity [...] according to which the State can ostensibly purchase unbound quantities of any good available for sale in its own currency, consequences be damned.”

While there isn’t much the Bitcoin community can agree on, the goal of creating “sound money” is shared by almost all. And for a currency to be sound money it must be scarce and free of state interference, which would suggest that Bitcoin is more sound than the US dollar.

In a Bitcoin-only world, MMT wouldn’t exist because you cannot simply mine more bitcoin than can be mined.

According to the data released by TokenInsight, last quarter, total derivatives market trading volume on Huobi Futures reached $438 billion, accounting for 22% of the total market trading volume. While institutional traders were major contributors to the recent growth, there was also a substantial uptick in activity from retail traders.

Huobi Futures has also gained significant traction for a relatively new derivative product, coin-margined perpetual contracts, which it only launched in late March—years behind the biggest competitor in the space. Despite the late entry into coin-margined swaps, Huobi Futures has already topped the market in cumulative trading volume. On May 12, the total 24h coin-margin perpetual trading volume on Huobi Futures exceeded $5.46 billion, outperforming its closest competitor.

""The last few quarters have been particularly exciting for the crypto derivatives market, but I'm more excited that the increased activity we're seeing today may be a catalyst for widespread crypto adoption,"" said Ciara. ""Rising demand for crypto derivatives from both institutional and retail user bases signifies growing acceptance of digital assets and a maturing market, so we're positioning Huobi Futures to bridge the gap towards traditional financial markets.""

With the rebrand, Huobi aims to make its derivatives exchange more approachable for new traders entering the crypto derivatives market. By appealing to a wider audience, Huobi Futures plans to continue on its current growth trajectory as it develops innovative new derivative products and broadens its user base.

The rebrand was first unveiled during a Consensus: Distributed session titled 'Crypto Evolution In a BTC Halving Year,' which was hosted by Huobi and joined by guest panelists from institutional blockchain firms like Pantera, Dragonfly, and Multicoin. Speaking during the session, Sun stated, ""While a name change is nothing too monumental, for us it represents an acknowledgement of the changing times we have seen in the cryptocurrency trading space.""

Despite the broader crypto markets posting price gains alongside Bitcoin (BTC) in recent weeks, the number of open longs remains low for most crypto assets after plummeting during the mid-March crypto market crash.

Ether longs dominate crypto markets

Since breaking into record highs on Feb. 26, ETH/USD longs on major crypto exchange Bitfinex have increased by 170%, with the violent Black Thursday mid-March crash failing to drive even a modest retracement among Bitfinex’s bulls.

After increasing roughly 50% from March 2019 until the start of 2020, ETH/BTC longs shot up by a further 83%.

Altcoin longs dry up

The trading activity surrounding other top crypto assets, including several purported Ethereum killers, has dried up significantly as speculators bet on the Bitcoin halving and Ethereum’s forthcoming ETH 2.0 overhaul.

On the heels of a weak year-to-date price performance relative to other top cryptocurrencies, the third-ranked crypto asset by market cap, Ripple (XRP), saw longs plummet 40% in two days after Black Thursday.

Today, China is leading the global digital asset initiative. The train of innovations seems to go faster as the digital yuan (also referred to as DCEP) has fueled rapid development in the field of distributed ledger technology.

Instead of wallowing in a swamp of regulatory uncertainty, the Chinese government shifted its attention to benefits. The Chinese have not wasted time, and despite being the country where the new coronavirus started and has since made a huge impact on society and economy, tech development did not stop, but rather accelerated at astonishing rates. Reportedly, McDonald’s and Starbucks are among a group of 19 restaurants, retail shops and entertainment companies taking part in a trial of China’s digital yuan, part of a pilot program prior to a wider roll-out of the new digital currency. While the Chinese central bank digital currency seems just a few steps away from launch, the world is starving for digital cash and fintech apps.

New trends reshaping the digital landscape

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has not only had a negative global impact, but has pushed people to seek alternative solutions to avoid using cash. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are still popular, but such assets are unlikely to ever become units of account. Stablecoins and CBDCs can save the day, though. The People’s Bank of China stated that the “processes of top-level design, setting industry standards, developing potential functions and integration testing” were “almost complete.”

Moreover, the PBoC says that the digital yuan has outpaced the infamous Libra concept in terms of major technical features such as the option to process transactions offline on mobile devices. It’s also stated that one of the goals for the DCEP is to promote the internationalization of the yuan as a way to make cross-border payments without the need to involve intermediaries that charge a huge fee and take a considerable amount of time to process such transactions.

In the last month, we’ve seen several central banks announce plans to experiment with CBDCs. Earlier this spring, the Bank of France officially launched an experimental program for a digital euro, testing the integration of a CBDC for interbank settlements, while a very similar plan was announced by South Korea’s central bank a week later.

There is plenty of room to expand the use of digital assets, and there must be no poor guidance. So, how can crypto improve daily life?

Trend 1: Revamping payments and remittances

Blockchain technology is used to reshape remittances and provide instant transfer solutions, raising the bar for the apps we use. From the local to the global cross-border level — fast and cheap payments are now in higher demand than ever, and cutting-edge solutions that provide a smooth experience can make a difference and contribute to the rapid adoption of digital assets.

As fintech is blooming globally, top-notch apps have appeared on the horizon. For example, an app developed by the Switzerland-based company Aximetria enables users to make transactions in crypto and traditional currencies in one app while enjoying zero commissions. Clients can use the app regardless of citizenship and place of residence. Other mobile solutions such as the Coinbase wallet provide smooth crypto experiences, offering a safe gateway to crypto for institutional investors.

Trend 2: Providing a better technology layer

The pace of all processes, including blockchain, may speed up drastically due to constant blockchain developments and updates. In addition, the crypto sector has been cleared up since 2017, after many malicious actors stepped into the scene.

The whole movement will be faster as DLT revamp many areas — from food and clothes manufacturing to complex international logistics, areas that are ever more important to the world since COVID-19 has ravaged manufacturing and logistics.

Trend 3: Ensuring global transparency

We can’t afford total freedom, as it mostly stays the dream of crypto-anarchists. CBDCs will be issued sooner or later, tied to government control, but transparency here lies in the fact of the inability to manipulate and defraud, so corruption will naturally decline. Even state administration will become an effective tool because we will see how funds will be spent.

Recognizing opportunity in the post-COVID-19 world

The emergence of digitized national currencies is closer than we think. Moreover, after years of initial coin offerings and cases of fraud, numerous illicit actors started leaving the blockchain scene, and as such we see the advent of the next wave led by stablecoins and the DeFi lending opportunity.

In addition, as world markets crashed and then fluctuated wildly as a result of the pandemic on March 12, Coin Metrics research points out the increasing role of stablecoins amid growing commissions and expanding spreads in cryptocurrency trading due to the turbulence. After the outbreak of the coronavirus began to affect global markets, the supply of stablecoins started to grow.

We’re going fast on our crypto learning curve. Tim Draper’s famous statement, which claimed that crypto will be mainstream in five years, no longer seems viable, as it will happen in a much faster timeframe. We will be able to buy much more than a latte. Crypto continues growing in popularity, utility and ubiquity, shedding its geek-only niche, as society is already tech-savvy enough to utilize and fully embrace such a solution. What we really need right now to go mainstream is a less sophisticated but more user-friendly and convenient interface that can enable people to interact with crypto more often.

To survive means to adapt. During the last few months, the world has changed drastically. We have realized the benefits of everything that can be done remotely. Online conference rooms have become a trend, as has the ability to work from the comfort of one’s sofa or a new home office area, even if hastily thrown together. It’s all rapidly improving due to the necessity of staying at home — now no longer the luxury of a few.

An example is the crypto-based emergency app Guardian Circle, which has seen a huge surge in downloads due to the coronavirus crisis, resulting in a monthly growth of 2582% for the three-year-old app, which had struggled to attract attention in the peacetime of a pre-virus world.

Microsoft’s latest data shows the rise of remote work has led to a skyrocketing increase of 775% in the usage of the brand’s cloud services in regions that have implemented social-distancing rules. For example, the Zoom app is currently in higher demand than ever before, with JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty noting third-party data that indicates its daily usage is up more than 300% from before the pandemic forced workers into their homes.

Moreover, the trends taking place or emerging nowadays in our current reality will have a high impact on the world of post-virus aftermath, changing the landscape of work and communication, as Zoom’s CEO Erik Yuan pointed out. The need for physical workstations and the idea that work effectiveness depends on a physical presence is already becoming a relic of the past.

Reddit’s points were rolled out across two subreddit communities pertaining to the topics of the popular video game Fortnite (r/fortniteBR) and cryptocurrency (r/cryptocurrency) from May 13 to May 15.

Perhaps surprisingly, over 80% of wallets created on the testnet so far represent the Fortnite community.

Reddit ""Community Points"" wallets tag five figures

Within three days of completing its rollout, over 10,000 users have signed up to receive Reddit’s Community Points as a reward for their activity on the popular social platform.

As of this writing, 8,666 wallets have been created to hold r/fortniteBR’s Bricks, while just 2,073 Redditors have embraced r/cryptocurrency’s Moons.

2,295 transactions have been executed by Moon wallets, while Brick wallets have produced 9,584 — producing identical per-wallet activity of 1.1 transactions per address so far.

Will Reddit spike gas prices?

Reddit plans to migrate its Community Points system to the Ethereum mainnet after the summer. A timeline is yet to be given for when Reddit plans to offer the crypto-based rewards to its entire 450 million user base.

While many Ethereum users have welcomed Reddit’s use of the protocol as a likely catalyst for widespread adoption, others are concerned that its Community Points could drive up gas prices once it migrates to mainnet.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-are-using-supercomputers-to-mine-crypto,"Hackers have attacked multiple supercomputers across Europe this week with the intention of mining cryptocurrency. Clusters of supercomputers have been forced to shut down in order to investigate the intrusions, according to a ZDNet news report on May 16.

These security incidents were reported in the UK, Germany, and Switzerland. Additionally, another possible attack occurred in a high-performance computer center in Spain, according to the report.

College campuses are the main victims

Most of the attacks appear to have targeted universities. University of Edinburgh,which runs the ARCHER supercomputer, reported the first incident on Monday.

Then, major universities’ high-performance computing clusters in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany also announced that they were attacked on Monday with similar security incidents, and had to be shut down.

More attacks happened in institutions in other parts of Germany, Spain, and Switzerland later in the week. Clusters in the Leibniz Computing Center, or LRZ, an institute under the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the Julich Research Center in the town of Julich, Germany, the Faculty of Physics at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany, and the Swiss Center of Scientific Computations, or CSCS, in Zurich, Switzerland were all counted amongst the victims.

SSH logins are compromised and the goal is to mine crypto

The malware samples released by the Computer Security Incident Response Team were reviewed by a US-based cyber-security firm, says the news. The Computer Security Incident Response Team, or CSIRT, is a pan-European organization that coordinates research on supercomputers across Europe.

The cyber-security company said the attackers appear to have stolen university members’ SSH credentials in Canada, China, and Poland in order to gain access to the supercomputer clusters. Secure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

Chris Doman, Co-Founder of Cado Security explained that:

“Once attackers gained access to a supercomputing node, they appear to have used an exploit for the CVE-2019-15666 vulnerability to gain root access and then deployed an application that mined the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.”

As Cointelegraph reported previously, university campuses were ranked the second biggest miners of digital currency across industry.",,,,

The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading around $9,630 at time of writing, representing an over 145% gain on the low of $3,867 registered March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

However, the cryptocurrency faced rejection near $10,000 early Monday – its third failure to cross info five figures since May 1 – and printed a low of $9,450 during European trading hours. The drop put prices down over 0.5% on the day.

Meanwhile, gold, a safe haven asset, is currently trading 1.16% up on the day at $1,760 per ounce – the highest level since October 2012. The precious metal has risen by 4% since May 12 and is up 21% from the lows registered in March.

“Bitcoin has not been able to stay above the significant US$10,000 level [but] it has made considerable gains through the year. Gold has seen more than a 15% increase since 1st January 2020, but we have to remember that BTC has also increased by 33% through the same period, “ said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency platform Luno.

Essentially, Swanepoel is suggesting bitcoin may be facing temporary bull exhaustion, as buyer fatigue is common following strong price rallies like the one seen in bitcoin over the past two months.

Gold, too, faced buyer exhaustion following a quick rally from $1,450 to $1,747 in the four weeks to mid-April. The safe-haven metal consolidated in a narrowing price range for nearly a month before breaking higher on May 14.

Pullbacks may be short-lived

As such, bitcoin may continue to under perform compared with gold in the short term. The cryptocurrency may also suffer a drop similar to the one seen following bitcoin’s second halving on July 9, 2016. Bitcoin underwent its third halving last Monday.

However, the post-halving pullback seen in 2016 was short-lived and the cryptocurrency went on to hit new record highs within one year from halving. “The dramatic increase in bitcoin value following the 2nd halving was not immediate, and we still feel that the potential 3rd halving increase is likely to come through,” said Swanepoel.

Additionally, other macro factors which supposedly pushed bitcoin higher over the last two months, are still valid.

The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to expand its balance sheet via unprecedented inflation-boosting open-ended asset purchases and stands ready to do more in the near future.

“I will say that we’re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there’s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have. So there’s a lot more we can do to support the economy, and we’re committed to doing everything we can as long as we need to,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday.

Further, the U.S.-China tensions over the coronavirus outbreak are leading to a renewed trade spat and major economies are still struggling to decide whether to reopen economies in spite of the coronavirus dangers or risk a more prolonged slowdown with continued lockdowns.

Demand ahead?

With all this in mind, investors have a strong incentive to look for alternative safe havens apart from traditional assets like gold, U.S. treasuries and Japanese yen. Increasingly, investors appear to consider bitcoin a safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation. That’s because the cryptocurrency’s supply is limited to 21 million and the pace of issuance is cut by half every four years at the halving events.

And new investors are indeed entering the crypto space, according to B2C2, one of the largest over-the-counter (OTC) market makers. “We are seeing explosive growth in OTC volumes this year with new counterparties coming online each month. Geographically there’s been a large pick-up in hedge fund activities from the Americas while we’ve seen a pick-up in European high-net-worth demand,” Phillip Gillespie, CEO of B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.

“Our sharpest directional clients are all quite long and seem to be positioning for a break higher,” Gillespie added, drawing attention to the bitcoin-gold ratio, which may provide a hint of increased investor interest in alternative inflation hedges like bitcoin.

The ratio currently stands at 5.44, while the resistance of the trendline linking the December 2017 and June 2019 highs is located at 6.40.

The Thesis team cited a bug, but is not disclosing details until all funds have been safely withdrawn from this iteration of tBTC. Thesis is now helping early users withdraw any BTC that had been deposited.

The project lead behind the new system, Thesis CEO Matt Luongo, sent the following statement to CoinDesk via a spokesperson:

""While the tBTC dapp was being tested over the weekend in its alpha version, a couple of community members put a few BTC into the contract before testing had concluded. Meanwhile, an issue in the dapp that was missed by our security audit was found by two of our contributors, and we decided to pause deposits for now to ensure the safety of funds. It is thanks to the strength and engagement of our community that this was identified quickly and all funds are safe.""

Luongo said the priority now was to further enhance the security of the system before announcing a timeline to re-deploy it. A new audit is being conducted by Trail of Bits; another auditor will also be enlisted and its bug bounty has been increased tenfold.

Luongo first announced that tBTC had been paused at 5:58 UTC on Monday. It had been live for two days. He credited a member of the Thesis team for finding the flaw, and Summa’s James Prestwich for verifying it.

Luongo wrote later in the Twitter thread, “Because the system is young and most minters are active community members, I think we can get this done in 1 to 2 days. Though we fixed the issue in code last night, we don’t want to expose it until all funds are drained.”

Prestwich declined to comment. Luongo wrote on Twitter that a full post-mortem is forthcoming. A Thesis spokesperson told CoinDesk this will likely be released tomorrow.

Thesis has taken down the tBTC dapp to make the smart contract less accessible. As of this writing, Etherscan shows 7 tBTC minted, of a max of 11 BTC.

The security model for tBTC is described in its documentation. It delineates four things Thesis can do with its key to the smart contract. Among those, it can pause new deposits one time for 10 days.

The famous venture capital fund, which has a substantial crypto portfolio, said in a post Friday it anticipated some of the better projects created in the wake of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom to contribute to a new industry boom period.

Pulling from “anecdotal” evidence and data going back 10 years, a16z says “price innovation cycles” – including those that peaked in 2011, 2013 and 2017 – begin with price increases that attract new people with bright ideas who end up creating promising companies and projects that benefit the space overall.

“A key feature of crypto cycles is that each one plants seeds which later grow and drive the next cycle,” reads the blog post. These new projects ultimately “inspire more people, eventually culminating in the next cycle.” Ethereum was created in the 2013 cycle, for example, and that became the foundation for the ICOs that drove the next cycle in 2017.

The VC fund forecasts: “The 2017 cycle spawned dozens of exciting projects in a wide range of areas including payments, finance, games, infrastructure, and web apps. Many of these projects are launching in the near future, possibly driving a fourth crypto cycle.”

The blog post comes just under three weeks after the VC firm said its new Crypto Fund II exceeded the initial $450 million fundraising target and would launch with a total of $515 million to invest in the space.

Unlike the first fund, which launched in 2018 with a more general investment prospectus, a16z said the new fund would target specific sectors within the industry, including decentralized finance (DeFi), next-generation payments and Web 3 (the concept of a decentralized internet).

A blog post at the time, written by a16z general partner Chris Dixon, also co-author of the latest post, said: “In just a decade of existence, crypto has gone through several waves. With each new wave, the applications of crypto extend to a greater number of categories and more visionary entrepreneurs enter the space.”

A16z doesn’t predict when this fourth cycle might hit crypto. But many of the projects it suggests could play a pivotal role in the next iteration of the industry are also, perhaps unsurprisingly, ones it has invested in.

These include derivatives exchange dYdX, cloud computing platform Dfinity, stablecoin provider Maker, and “privacy-first” cloud platform Oasis Labs – all four of which are in a16z’s active portfolio.",2020-05-18 13:03:00+00:00,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/18/2034804/0/en/KRONOS-ADVANCED-TECHNOLOGIES-NOW-ACCEPTS-CRYPTOCURRENCIES-THROUGH-COINBASE.html,"Los Angeles, CA, May 18, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Los Angeles, California /GLOBENEWSWIRE/- May 18, 2020 -KRONOS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, Inc., (OTC:KNOS) (""KNOS"" or the ""Company"") a product development and production company that has significantly changed the way air is moved, filtered and sterilized today announced that it accepts bitcoin through an integration with Coinbase. Consumers can pay for Kronos air purifiers and all of our products online using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Kronos President and BDO Michael Rubinov said, “It’s great to see Kronos accept cryptocurrencies, adding these new purchasing options available to Coinbase users and all bitcoin enthusiasts whom are looking to spend bitcoin whilst opening new marketing opportunities for Kronos’ unique product lines.”

Bitcoinmarketjournal.com recently published research findings on bitcoin users:

Over 42 million bitcoin wallets had been established globally by December 2019

An estimated five percent of Americans hold Bitcoin

There are 7.1 million active bitcoin users

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has over 30 million users

Emerging market users that are often not considered in statistics are estimated to be in the millions.

“In today’s economic reality it’s easy to see the value of integrating a Coinbase merchant account, opening up our innovative products to new consumers, and by being one of the first companies in the air purifiers industry to adopt cryptocurrency as a form of payment gives us a competitive advantage,” -added Michael.

Kronos ships worldwide so adding Bitcoin as a payment option made sense since crypto payments are global and have no risk of chargebacks as with legacy credit cards. Implementing Coinbase solution was seamless, saving 2 - 3% on each transaction made in cryptocurrency versus other payment methods. In our checkout page, the Coinbase logo is featured along other major payment providers to make it easy for customers to choose Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a payment option.

There are 8000+ merchants already accepting cryptocurrencies using Coinbase merchant services.

The Company anticipates that the addition of crypto payments via Coinbase will give the company access to a broader customer base with the potential to attract countless new sales opportunities not unlike the successes witnessed by Overstock.

ABOUT COINBASE

Founded in June of 2012, Coinbase is a digital currency wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can transact with new digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin. The Company is based in San Francisco, California. The number of users on Coinbase has passed 30 million with 8 million having joined the exchange over the past year. Coinbase is America's biggest cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service.

Bitcoin is the world's most widely used alternative currency with a total market cap of over $180 billion. The bitcoin network is made up of thousands of computers operated by various interests throughout the world.

ABOUT KRONOS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, Inc

Kronos Advanced Technologies, Inc. began operations in 2002 as a product development company which invented and significantly changed the way air is moved, filtered and sterilized. Historically, Kronos has focused on developing, marketing and selling the Company's proprietary air movement and purification technology. Serving the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) market, Kronos technology uses state-of-the-art high voltage processes without the use of traditional HEPA filters. Kronos-based products move air silently, filter and purify the air, and dramatically reduce energy consumption to half of a 60-watt light bulb. Kronos devices can be variable in shape or size, and, therefore, have the potential to be scaled down for air purification in cars or scaled up in size for industrial and hazardous gas destruction. The technology is currently being implemented in standalone products to move and filter air replacing HEPA and other filtration systems. There are broad ranges of additional markets for standalone and embedded Kronos CORE technology based devices. Examples of immediately addressable markets include health care facilities, operating rooms, manufacturing clean rooms and cabins of automobiles and commercial aircraft.

Currently the Company is planning to file additional patents in order to improve its existing technology as well as enter into new market segments but will continue to market air purifiers and other consumer products. Recently the Company became the Exclusive distributor and licensee of the newest generation of air purifiers based on the Company’s CORE technologies.

Tether maintained or exceeded par value consistently during bitcoin’s subsequent two-month rally.

The cryptocurrency, also known as USDT, dipped below $1 on Friday and has stayed below that mark as of press time Monday, according to data from exchanges Kraken and OkCoin, which support two of the largest USDT/USD markets by volume. Bittrex and FTX, which also support the trading pair, showed similarly discounted tether prices.

One possible explanation for the price dip is persistently strong buying pressure for bitcoin, especially on futures markets. Tether is typically used as a stand-in for U.S. dollars on crypto exchanges, a currency for buying other assets rather than an investment. Big shifts in demand can cause tether to temporarily deviate from its peg.

For instance, the bellwether stablecoin spiked as high as $1.03 on Kraken in early March when bitcoin fell to 12-month lows amid market-wide bitcoin selling.

“Bitcoin futures are at premiums, indicating buy pressure,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, an exchange that also supports a USDT/USD market. “That can drive up BTC/USDT and so drive down USDT, especially on margin exchanges,” he explained.

USDT/USD historical price data from Kraken Source: TradingView

Tether’s dip below $1 coincides with a brief respite of new token issuances. “We’ve seen really strong USDT inflows for months unrelated to BTC price movements, and it’s possible those are tapering off,” said Bankman-Fried.

Over the past two months, Tether Ltd. issued over 3.5 billion new tokens, an average of roughly 60 million tethers per day, according to Coin Metrics data. Since Thursday, however, tether’s market capitalization, a proxy for supply since it’s ostensibly redeemable for $1, decreased by $7 million.",2020-05-18 18:47:56+00:00,https://decrypt.co/29212/fortnite-players-love-reddits-new-cryptocurrency,"In brief: Reddit has launched test versions of Ethereum-based ""Community Points"" in Fortnite and cryptocurrency subreddits.

It looks like gamers are interested in the tokens much more than crypto enthusiasts.

Some users have already announced the launch of a Reddit DAO.

Just a few days after Reddit rolled out trial versions of its Ethereum-based “Community Points” in its cryptocurrency and Fortnite subreddits, one forum has seen much higher takeup. And it wasn’t the cryptocurrency subreddit.

According to DappRadar’s recently launched Reddit Points Tracker, while both communities have comparable numbers of users, Fortnite fans have registered 9,246 wallets for their “Bricks” coins. In contrast, cryptocurrency subscribers have only registered 2,205 wallets for their “Moons” coins.

Adoption is four times higher in the Fornite community than in Reddit’s own cryptocurrency community. Image: DappRadar.

While Reddit’s Community Points are tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain, they are not entirely a “cryptocurrency” in a traditional sense—rather a reward/loyalty system that aims to promote user engagement.

Redditors can gift, tip and transfer their Community Points between users—or use them to gain access to exclusive community features such as badges, custom emojis and GIFs in comments, the announcement explained.

Reddit’s Community Points are currently running on the Rinkeby testnet, so balances, transactions and memberships may be reset during that period, the developers warned. After this trial, the system—including points balances—will migrate to the Ethereum mainnet.

Redditors can gift, tip and transfer their Community Points between users. Image: Reddit.

But why the greater takeup in the Fortnite community? While the two subreddits have similar subscriber counts, the Fortnite community is much more active. At the time of writing, there’s twice as many Redditors online in the Fortnite subreddit. Further, if you look at Reddit statistics, Fortnite ranks 28th by the number of comments in the last day, while the cryptocurrency subreddit doesn’t even rank in the top 300.

The launch of a Reddit DAO

Some Reddit users have already announced the launch of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to Reddit’s new cryptocurrencies. A DAO is a way of organizing a group of people with a shared goal, using the blockchain as a way of voting for what to do, and for moving money.

DAOs are built across the Ethereum ecosystem. They are used to allocate funds for building new projects or to decide how a marketing budget should be spent.

“A DAO is like a club with a shared bank account, where the power is shared amongst all members as shares which act as voting power. [...] We have summoned a DAO on the same network as MOONS & BRICKS, and you’re welcome to play around with us and figure out what we want to do ” the announcement explained.

In this case, since the cryptocurrencies are built on an Ethereum testnet, the DAO is also built on the same testnet. A testnet is a practice version of a public blockchain—where the money has no value.

To join the DAO, Redditors will have to submit a proposal and request a proportionate amount of shares.

“With MOONS and BRICKS now available to Reddit users, these tokens can be used elsewhere throughout the entire Ethereum ecosystem. In the Ethereum space, we’ve been using what are called DAOs to collaborate and coordinate as communities, and think it would be really powerful on Reddit,” the proposal stated.

Although it’s not entirely clear what the goal of such a DAO could be. Its organizers just noted that it will allow Redditors to create a “bank of funds [that] can be collectively voted on to spend on whatever the community wants.”

At the end of the day, those who join the DAO will decide what it’s used for. They won’t be able to control the cryptocurrencies—since they’re in the hands of Reddit—but the members may decide to allocate resources to different Redditors. If the cryptocurrencies move to the main Ethereum blockchain and become valuable, then the money could be used to fund projects involving the coins.

Reddit may soon find the project taking control of itself.",2020-05-18 14:48:18,https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-cash-to-crypto-covid-19-is-changing-the-way-the-world-sees-money,"Technology has always been one of the main drivers that has boosted social changes. Of course, there have been other reasons: wars, natural cataclysms and disasters, plague pandemics and more. Speaking of such, the current COVID-19 situation, being a once-in-a-century type of pandemic, has come at an inconvenient time. But the time is never right.

However, what happened in late 2019 made an impact on various industries to a level that can hardly be estimated at the current moment. The losses and negative aftermaths are imminent, and the use of cutting-edge technology may shine some light during this period of looming darkness. Digital currencies, which had previously been raising controversial questions, now see high demand both from ordinary users and institutional investors. What couldn’t be changed naturally for a long time has shifted fast during the crisis. Global adoption of digital payments and cryptocurrencies has already started.

From old traditions to new trends

Ongoing changes in social interactions may become irreversible, changing the world forever. The life of humanity has become even more digitized, and we are witnessing an accelerated transition to a cashless society.

Ongoing advancements such as 5G tower rollouts worldwide have caused an increase in conspiracy theories and even led to savage acts of arson, as some believe they are closely tied to the current pandemic. The development of society has always been tied to a certain amount of risk. The world differs in its views on technological progress. While some countries in Asia, such as Japan, have always spearheaded robotics and new developments, others have remained true to old traditions, hardly accepting the changes offered by progress.

In Europe, the pace of change has been accelerated due to the horrific numbers of diseased people. Suddenly, everyday things such as paper money have transformed into dangerous items that can bring death. Cash-loving European citizens have started to use cards more. For example, Germans have switched massively to using digital payments as credit card transactions have surged for the first time in the country’s history.

Besides, the virus has caused a drastic increase in the use of financial technology applications in Europe and the whole world, as more people now work or conduct commercial operations remotely.

Moreover, the road to mainstream crypto adoption has begun, as institutions have stepped in, in a big way. The interest from the population is also growing. For example, a survey conducted by the European branch of the bitFlyer crypto exchange based on 10,000 respondents across 10 European countries revealed that 2/3 of the local population thinks that cryptocurrency is here to stay.

Leaving physical money behind

The incentivization of interest from global players has also contributed to the transformation of society and crypto adoption. We now see that some people that have gained help from the government during the pandemic have spent it on Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional investors are highly interested in something that can protect them from risks, and it means that more and more investors will take a look at the crypto market over time.

The growth of the crypto market and demand for this new kind of money has become even more noticeable during spring 2020. Bitcoin ATM locations have surged to over 8,000 worldwide amid the global crisis, institutional investors are coming to decentralized finance, and even the crème de la crème of finance such as Paul Tudor Jones regard crypto as an instrument for risk diversification, thus marking a clear signal for others.

The global view on crypto has shifted from a ""geeky asset for speculation"" to an ""asset that shelters from crisis."" The trust is hard earned, and blockchain can offer trust quantification of a yet unprecedented level.

It's clear that digital money is safer to use for any kind of payment — a quality that one would have rarely considered as more than just a convenient feature before the pandemic — and stablecoins are the best tools that can be taken out of this particular box.

And stablecoins have experienced higher demand — Tether’s (USDT) market capitalization in the last few months has significantly increased, becoming the third-largest cryptocurrency — and this number is more than the amount issued between all of 2015 and mid-2019!

Meanwhile, speaking of regulated approaches to cryptocurrency projects, we don’t see much progress. The European Central Bank's approach to stablecoins still remains analytical rather than a practical call to action.

The regulators and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission tend to hamper crypto ecosystems such as Libra and Telegram. While the latter quit the game and dropped its guns just recently, the fate of the Facebook-led initiative is still unclear.

As for government-issued stablecoins, competition still remains sluggish as China leads the race with the digital yuan program. The U.S., however, has incentivized the creation of its kind of central bank digital currency as Congress has seen a new bill introduced that mandates the implementation of digital dollar wallets by Jan. 1, 2021.

By mid-spring 2020, central banks had recommended banning stablecoins as they pushed for heavy-duty regulation of centralized, privately issued global stablecoins and considered prohibiting decentralized ones. While some countries are embracing and fostering innovations, others tend to be hostile toward cryptocurrencies, restricting or totally banning Bitcoin and crypto operations.

Finally, the European Central Bank is looking to renovate its payments infrastructure, studying both public and private solutions, with or without blockchain.

It's clear that the distributed ledger technology topic is of interest, and the technology is there, but Europe is way ahead of the U.S. when it comes to experiments with stablecoins that may be backed by governmental bonds. Regulatory bodies worldwide enjoy watching private companies experimenting with this business model. Paving the way to its legitimization is possible in the form of an e-money version 2.0.

Digital asset domination is imminent

The coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the economy is hard to evaluate, and the changes triggered by the pandemic are here to stay for a long time. Society will further transition to digital solutions and remote workplaces, which will ultimately change the living landscape, shifting from cash to card payments and from card payments to crypto.

In 2020, apps for cryptocurrencies have become advanced enough to enable the purchase of digital currencies with just a credit card, allowing for the sending of small amounts of money even without the need for Know Your Customer protocols. Stablecoin wallets are in high demand, and this evident trend is no more a millennial-only kind of thing.

And for bitcoin traders, it’s bullish that key events on the blockchain network over the past couple weeks have gone smoothly, showing that the machine is working well. Or, at least, exactly as it was designed.

On May 11, the Bitcoin blockchain underwent the third “halving” in its history, a once-every-four-years occurrence when the pace of new issuance of bitcoin gets automatically cut in half. The much-hyped event passed so unobtrusively that it got panned as anticlimactic, even dull.

Now, bitcoiners are counting down to the next milestone on the blockchain: the latest “difficulty adjustment,” expected Tuesday. Occurring roughly every two weeks, it’s another automatic mechanism built into the network to keep things operating smoothly. And like the halving it’s expected to be uneventful.

“It’s validating that bitcoin is just like a perfect little clock and it just keeps ticking, and we can rely on it,” Tuur Demeester, founder of Adamant Capital, said in a video interview published Monday by data provider Messari.

Adamant Capital's Tuur Demeester in a Messari video interview on YouTube.

Demeester drew a contrast with another human-designed construct, the traditional monetary system, where central banks led by the Federal Reserve this year have unilaterally injected trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus into the global financial system. The central banks say the moves aim to keep the economy and markets from collapsing, but the officials are effectively just making up monetary policy on the fly.

“It’s just such a contrast with this craziness in the central banking world, where all bets are off,” Demeester said. “Who knows what’s next?”

Bitcoin prices rose Monday to about $9,700, and are up 36% to date this year. That contrasts with an 8.6% gain in 2020 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, even after a rally Monday fueled by optimism that a coronavirus vaccine might be showing signs of promise.

Just like the bitcoin halving had several “countdown clocks” erected by cryptocurrency data providers, the difficulty adjustment has its own countdown clock – the Bitcoin Difficulty Estimator.

According to the tool, the difficulty adjustment is supposed to take place Tuesday around 5 p.m. New York time. And it’s supposed to make the difficulty of finding new bitcoin about 5 percent easier.

Source: Bitcoin Difficulty Estimator

The difficulty adjustment will be the network’s first since last week’s halving, and its significance this time can’t really be understood outside of that milestone.

The new bitcoin produced by the blockchain every day are the rewards for computer operators known as “miners” who agree to help maintain the network and keep it secure. So when the rewards were cut by half last week, the miners suffered an immediate reduction in their daily revenue.

True to the incentives built into the bitcoin blockchain, less-efficient and high-cost miners – primarily those with older-generation computers or in regions where electricity is more expensive – dropped off the network, to avoid losing money.

The defections were evidenced by a reduction in the “hash rate,” which is the number of new computations sent to the network each second.

Source: Blockchain.com

Average times to confirm new data blocks increased to about 18 minutes after the halving, well above the 10-minute average targeted in bitcoin’s original programming, according to Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm.

The slowdown caused transactions in the network to back up. That’s apparent from a chart of the “mempool,” which is the aggregate size in bytes of transactions waiting to be confirmed on the blockchain:

Source: Blockchain.com

Since transactions got backed up, any senders wishing for faster confirmation times had to increase their fees to get priority. So average transaction fees rose to $4.91 from $2.38, the highest in 11 months, according to Delphi.

Source: Glassnode, Delphi Digital

This is where Tuesday’s difficulty adjustment comes in. By making it easier for miners to find new blocks, the network should automatically bring block times back down to around 10 minutes and “should result in more mining power coming back on line,” according to Delphi.

The “difficulty adjustment should help to clear the log and return the fees to normal,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in a note to clients.

Just like clockwork. And refreshingly dull.

BTC: Price: $9,770 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,817 | 24-Hr Low: $9,473

Trend: While bitcoin has recovered from lows below $9,500 seen earlier on Tuesday, the immediate bias remains neutral with prices are still trading within Monday’s price range.

The top cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business on Monday, printing a high and low of $9,966 and $9,451, respectively, before ending the day (midnight, UTC) on a flat note at $9,720.

Essentially, the cryptocurrency created a “doji” candle, comprising of long upper and lower wicks and a small body. The candle is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market place. In such cases, traders usually wait for strong directional bias to emerge in the form of a move outside of the doji’s high or low.

So, Monday’s doji candle has made Tuesday’s UTC close pivotal. A close above the doji candle’s high of $9,966 would mean the period of indecision has ended in a bull victory. That could cause more buyers to join the market, leading to a stronger rise toward $10,500.

Alternatively, acceptance under doji’s low of $9,451 would confirm a bearish reversal and shift risk in favor of a drop to the 200-day average located at $8,050.

The longer duration indicators like the weekly chart MACD histogram and the 14-week relative strength index are reporting bullish conditions. Additionally, the previous weekly candle violated a long-term descending trendline in favor of continued upward move. As a result, a bullish daily close looks likely.",2020-05-19 11:55:46+00:00,https://inc42.com/buzz/bitcoin-surge-brings-new-investors-as-exchanges-eye-indian-market/,"This week, the steady increase of Bitcoin (BTC) prices has caught the attention of a lot of new investors and many have already begun investing in this disruptive asset.

The market research organization, The Tokenist, recently published a report called “Comparing Public Bitcoin Adoption Rates in 2020 vs 2017.” The study’s findings give a comprehensive look at the cryptocurrency ecosystem between 2017 and now. The researchers’ survey shows that since the post-Covid-19 economy is setting in, trust in bitcoin has grown 29% in the past three years.

Faith In Traditional Banks and Financial Incumbents Is Waning

A recently published study from the crypto think tank, The Tokenist, details that there is a growing trust in bitcoin over traditional investments like gold, stocks, and real estate. The market researchers leveraged a survey that was taken in April 2020 (5,421 participants in 24 countries) and collated several surveys from 2017 as well. The Tokenist utilized these polls to see how attitudes and perceptions have changed since the price fluctuations and the impact of Covid-19.

“Faith in large financial institutions has been steadily waning for more than a decade and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this process,” the report highlights. “Bitcoin, itself developed in the years after the 2008 market crash as an alternative to traditional assets, stands to be a major beneficiary of this trend.”

47% of the Poll’s Respondents Trust Bitcoin Over Big Banks

The Tokenist also leveraged surveys from the company’s mailing list and another that saw 4,852 participants in 17 countries. According to the study’s findings, The Tokenist researchers have found that there is a trend of individuals with “positive sentiment regarding BTC as a long term store of value.”

The findings note that over 45% of respondents preferred Bitcoin rather than stocks, real estate, and gold, and “61% of the total respondents (and 78% of millennials) are now somewhat familiar with BTC, and 14% of millennials have owned the asset.” The report continued:

47% of respondents trust Bitcoin over big banks, an increase of 29% in the past three years. 43% of respondents, and 59% of millennials, feel that most people will be using Bitcoin within the next decade. In 2020, 44% of millennials report that they are likely to buy BTC in the next five years. More than one in three millennials would hold onto Bitcoin they are given, while a slightly smaller number (27%) would immediately sell it. 39% of male millennials now have no problem with the intangible nature of BTC, and a quarter of millennials as a whole report the same attitude.

The report finds that the attitude toward BTC, in general, is more positive and optimism has increased by 27% during the last three years. “60% of respondents felt that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology,” The Tokenist’s report concludes. “Increased familiarity with Bitcoin has convinced many that it is a positive force,” the paper’s authors added.

The report, published on Tuesday, reveals that the share of bitcoin sent to mixers by darknet entities rose to 20% in Q1 2020 as compared to just 1% in Q1 2019.

On the other hand, the share of bitcoin sent to crypto exchanges with verification requirements, decreased to 13% in Q1 2020 from 24% in Q1 2019.

“This is likely in response to increased regulation and verification processes for exchanges, leading darknet bitcoin owners toward other services to obfuscate the source of their coins,” said Crystal Blockchain. Bitcoin mixers combine payments from multiple users into a single transaction, masking their origin.

Overall, darknet entities sent 7,946 bitcoins to mixers in Q1 2020 as compared to 790 bitcoins in Q1 2019. While in terms of USD, the value grew sharply from $3 million in Q1 2019 to $67 million in Q1 2020.

The amount of bitcoin received by darknet entities from mixing services also increased three-fold, from 106 bitcoins in Q1 2019 to 288 bitcoins in Q1 2020. In terms of USD, the amount increased to nearly $2 million in Q1 2020 as compared to $400,000 in Q1 2019.

“While more exchanges implement the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) requirements, darknet users are trying to avoid the risk of unveiling of their activity by those exchanges. To veil darknet activities, they started to prefer mixing services to exchanges for withdrawal of cryptocurrency,” said Crystal Blockchain.



Overall, the total amount of bitcoin sent and received by darknet entities decreased in Q1 2020 as compared to Q1 2019. This could be due to the growing popularity of altcoin usage, said Crystal Blockchain.

However, in terms of USD, darknet entities exchanged an increased amount of money — from $384 million in Q1 2019 to $411 million in Q1 2020. “This is partly explained by the growing capitalization of bitcoin, as well as further mass adoption of bitcoin. As it becomes increasingly easier to use cryptocurrency, the popularity of this payment method is steadily increasing,” said the firm.",,https://www.coindesk.com/eu-supercomputers-hijacked-from-covid-19-research-to-mine-cryptocurrency,"European supercomputers programmed to search for a vaccine for COVID-19 were remotely hijacked last week for the purpose of mining cryptocurrency.

According to a report by ZDNet, multiple supercomputers across the European Union were compromised by a string of malware attacks that required a shutdown after it was discovered they were being used for crypto mining – also known as cryptojacking. The hackers had gained entry via stolen SSH (remote access) credentials from individuals authorized to operate the machines.

Security researcher Chris Doman, co-founder of Cado Security, told ZDNet the malware was designed to use the supercomputers’ processing power to mine monero (XMR). It is also believed a number of the compromised supercomputers were being used to prioritize research for a coronavirus vaccine, although details surrounding the hacks and the computer’s purpose appear to have been left deliberately vague.

Security incident reports came from Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland, with a potential hijack also said to have occurred at a high-performance computer located in Spain.

The first reported incident took place on May 11 at the University of Edinburgh, which operates the ARCHER supercomputer. “Due to a security exploitation on the ARCHER login nodes, the decision has been taken to disable access to ARCHER while further investigations take place,” the university announced in a public update.

To date, the ARCHER supercomputer is still down pending further security purges, as well as a reset of its system and passwords. “The ARCHER and Cray/HPE System Teams continue to work on ARCHER and getting it ready to return to service. We anticipate that ARCHER will be returned to service later this week,” the university said.

Spate of breaches

Germany-based bwHPC, an organization that coordinates research projects across supercomputers in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, declared five of its high-performance computing clusters had to be shut down due to similar “security incidents.“

A supercomputer located in Barcelona, Spain, was also impacted on May 13, with researcher Felix von Leitner declaring in a blog post the computer had a security issue and had to be shut down.

On May 14, further incidents began cropping up with the first one coming from Leibniz Computing Center (LZR), an institute with the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. The Academy said it had disconnected a computing cluster from the internet after its security was breached.

On Saturday, German scientist Robert Helling published an analysis on the malware that was infecting a high-performance computing cluster at the Faculty of Physics at the Ludwig-Maximillian University University in Munich, Germany.

And in Switzerland, the Swiss Center of Scientific Computations (CSCS) in Zurich also shut down external access to its supercomputer infrastructure following a “cyber-incident” on Saturday.",2020-05-19 08:00:26+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-impending-golden-cross-bolster-bulls-analysts,"A widely tracked bitcoin price indicator is about to turn bullish – potentially accelerating the recent uptrend of the top cryptocurrency by market value.

The 50-day moving average (MA) of bitcoin’s price looks set to cross above the 200-day MA within two to three days. The resulting “golden crossover,” a long-term bull market indicator, would be the first since Feb. 18 and only the seventh in bitcoin’s lifetime, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Daily chart (2020)

“The golden crossover will catch the attention of classical trend followers,” said Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Trend-following traders do not predict or forecast specific levels but simply join the trend (bullish or bearish) when they feel a strong directional bias has been established. They often employ moving average crossover strategies to decide whether a trend is developing. This is because averages, which are based on past data, crowd out the noise created by intraday fluctuations and paint a better picture of the broader trend.

When a short-term MA moves above a long-term MA, a bullish cross is confirmed. That is considered a buy signal by trend followers. Alternatively, a bear cross is taken as a sell signal.

Thus, the impending golden cross, once confirmed, could bring in additional buying pressure from traders who employ MA strategies, leading to stronger price gains.

“I think MA strategies often work because they are self-reinforcing,” said Anthony Vince, head of trading at GSR. That viewpoint has logic as averages follow price and produce a bull cross following notable price gains. Once the cross is confirmed, more buyers join the market, potentially pushing prices higher.

Lennard Neo, lead analyst at Stack, also expects the upcoming golden cross to bode well for the cryptocurrency. “Moving averages tend to be one of the best-performing strategies when applied to crypto, at least for the past couple of years. We expect the same to happen in this potential golden cross, as BTC should see some upward price pressure,” said Neo.

Indeed, the golden cross that took place last April yielded more than 130% returns over just a 64-day period. Meanwhile, the golden cross witnessed in October 2015 was followed by a quickfire 64% rally in just eight days.

Some observers, however, are of the opinion that moving average crossovers are lagging indicators and often trap investors on the wrong side of the market. After all, MA studies are based on past data and tend to lag prices.

In the past, there have been instances where the golden crossover turned out to be a bull trap.

Daily chart (2020)

“The last golden cross was confirmed before Black Thursday (March 12) and the last death cross was confirmed before the April rally,” said Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.

“The July 2014 cross for instance, yielded -23% returns from cross up to cross down,” crypto research firm Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.

So, if history is a guide, golden crossover is an unreliable indicator of price trends.

Different this time?

What makes the upcoming golden cross different from some previous ones is the fact that it is supported by bullish fundamental developments.

The rewards per block mined on bitcoin’s block chain were cut to 6.25 BTC from 12.50 BTC last Monday. Most analysts expect the supply cut to put bitcoin into a long-term bull market, similar to the one seen in the months following the second reward halving, which took place in July 2016.

Additionally, the challenging macro environment brought on by the coronavirus outbreak and the unprecedented monetary stimulus launched by major central banks is expected to boost haven demand for bitcoin.

Hence, some analysts see a low probability of the upcoming bull cross turning out to be a bull trap. “Fundamentals and technicals are lining up well for the markets now, “ said Zhu.

Meanwhile, Neo said that “the fundamentals of bitcoin remain strong, which contemplates every reason for a break upside.”

The on-chain activity does show a strong holding sentiment in the investor community. “The number of bitcoins held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing since the crash in March, and is now approaching a one-year low. This is the largest and most prolonged BTC exchange balance downtrend in Bitcoin’s history,” Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence firm, noted in its weekly report.

Investors typically move bitcoins from their wallets to exchanges when they expect prices to drop. On the other hand, coins held on exchanges are withdrawn when the cryptocurrency is expected to see a sustainable price rise.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,800, representing a 0.6% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency found bids below $9,500 early on Tuesday, but is yet to cross above $10,000. The area around that level has proved a tough nut to crack over the past few days.

With both fundamentals and technicals biased bullish, a move above $10,000 may happen soon. “A successful break higher and the next significant level overhead would be the 61.8% Absolute Fib at $12,160 area,” said Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at London-based ADM Investor Services International Ltd.

However, over the past few days, the buyers have consistently struggled to keep gains above $9,840, as seen on the daily line chart. “Another failure there could see the forming of a possible double top and contemplation of the $6,000 area,” said Tofpik.",2020-05-19 11:13:40+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/65750/squares-cash-app-now-allows-automatic-bitcoin-purchases,"Square's Cash App now allows users to schedule automatic bitcoin purchases at set time intervals - daily, weekly, or bi-weekly.

The company also highlighted that popular crypto brokers like Tagomi are receiving custody services from Bakkt.

Bakkt Warehouse is a part of Bakkt Trust Company and was developed with the same cybersecurity and infrastructure as in the New York Stock Exchange.

The ICE-subsidiary acquired Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC), which provides cryptocurrency custody solutions to institutional investors and token issuers holding digital assets. The takeover helped Bakkt to secure the New York regulator’s approval to operate as a so-called ‘qualified custodian,’ which permits the company itself to hold custody of customers’ tokens.

The new insurance policy has been inked with a collaboration with the Digital Asset Risk Transfer team from Marsh.

Notably, Bakkt Warehouse funds were already covered with an existing insurance policy of $125 million.

Bakkt primarily offers US-regulated Bitcoin derivatives products that are settled in Bitcoin instead of cash to eliminate slippage.

The company is also planning to bring its trading platforms on mobile devices, however, the timeline of the launch is not public yet.

The ICE subsidiary recently acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a loyalty points platform, in a deal that is saying to be around $300 million.

A Twitter account set to issue tweet alerts when coins tied to certain addresses trade, indicated a trade of a batch of virtual currency that is “possibly” tied to Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or persons who wrote the software code for the digital currency back in 2009. The identity of Nakamoto has long been speculated on but the originator of bitcoin has never been verified.

About 11 years ago, he created, or mined, the original batch of bitcoins that are widely known as the genesis block.

The tweet suggests that the batch of some 40 or 50 bitcoins that changed hands on Wednesday were mined within the first month of the creation of bitcoin.

To be sure, the anonymous nature of the bitcoin makes it impossible to know the owner of the coins but the technology that underpins bitcoin makes tracking addresses of the certain blocks of coins possible.

Sleuthing for coins tied to the progenitor of the digital asset has become a regular pastime in the crypto community. Tracking big blocks of bitcoin also helps to understand the habits of those who hold substantial influence on bitcoin prices by dint of their holdings.

Bitcoin futures, representing a single bitcoin, were off 1.3% in Wednesday afternoon, with the most-actively traded May US:BTCK20 BTC.1, -3.16% at $9,550, while bitcoin spot prices BTCUSD, -3.10% were off 1.8% at $9,525, according to data from CoinDesk.

Bitcoin futures are up more than 32% so far in 2020, and they had been trading at an intrasession peak at $9,895 on Wednesday before settling lower.

A number of industry participants have pointed out that the fact that the bitcoins are 2009 vintage doesn’t necessarily mean that they are related to Nakamoto.

However, that didn’t stop interest in bitcoin surging on Twitter, with the term “satoshi” becoming a viral term on the social-media platform Twitter Wednesday afternoon.

Bitcoin was created as an alternative payment system 11 years ago, one that operated anonymously and peer-to-peer, eliminating the so-called trusted third party.

The cryptocurrency was born amid worries that modern currency is manufactured by central banks printing fiat money to boost economic growth—a view that has gained increasing traction amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Proponents of bitcoin argue that because the digital asset is decentralized from central banks or governments, individuals can conduct transactions without an intermediary. That is part of the appeal of bitcoin.

However, the nascent asset hasn’t made significant headway in price since hitting a December 2017 peak near $20,000.

Critics also point to the cryptocurrency’s association with money laundering as one of its biggest drawbacks. So far, bitcoin hasn’t achieved sufficient scalability to make it a legitimate currency much less a store of value, other opponents say.

That said, bitcoin has managed to hold its own compared with gold thus far this year, with gold futures GC00, -0.16% up 15% in the year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% is down 8.1% so far this year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.20% are off nearly 14% after a coronavirus-induced downturn virtually brought the equity markets to their knees in March.

While bitcoin’s price has recovered a bit, downward selling pressure remains and could have an impact on stakeholders, especially in the derivatives and mining sectors.

As of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $9,529, a loss of 1.2% over 24 hours. Bitcoin moved below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages on high selling volume. It’s a signal of bearish sentiment after bitcoin dropped as low as $9,100 earlier in the day on spot exchanges including Bitstamp.

After a few days of prices staying pretty much flat, bitcoin trading activity has picked up. However, that activity was mostly from sellers after one of the oldest bitcoin addresses suddenly showed signs of life, moving up to 50 BTC around for the first time in 11 years. That caused a quick 7% price drop within an hour.

This sell-off reminds traders to keep track of the oldest addresses in the bitcoin network, says Jose Llisterri, co-founder of crypto trading platform Interdax. “This occurrence highlights the importance of ‘address watching,’ monitoring the addresses of whales/early miners and the so-called ‘Satoshi coins’ mined in the first months of bitcoin.”

As of now, there is no evidence the 50 BTC were moved by accounts held by the pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the founder (or founders) of bitcoin.

While the price of bitcoin was able to recover some from the dip, stakeholders such as Mostafa Al-Mashita, head of business development for digital asset management firm Secure Digital Markets, are concerned the crypto market may be heading lower. “Coins from 2009 moving on-chain have definitely spooked some speculators about early players cashing out their coins,” said Al-Mashita.

Such selling also compounds losses because of leveraged derivatives positions that get liquidated. This dynamic is what exacerbated bitcoin’s massive drop in March to below $4,000 when BitMEX liquidations wiped out leveraged traders who were long crypto. Over $40 million in liquidations occurred during the time of bitcoin’s 7% drop Wednesday.

Another group of stakeholders watching the price carefully are miners. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusted on Tuesday, a 6% drop in the computational resources needed for machines on the network to produce new coins. Mining difficulty is how much computational power it takes for miners to mine for bitcoin.

Since the halving, bitcoin’s total daily rewards has been reduced from roughly 1,800 down to 900 BTC. Miners are more sensitive to price than ever before, despite the recent easing of difficulty.

Christopher Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, senses bitcoin’s price is too high despite today’s selling activity. “I’ve felt we’ve been hanging around the $9,900 level without any conviction for the last week or so,” he told CoinDesk. ”We’ll likely move lower to the support levels around $8,000 and possibly further to $7,300.”

“The lower we go, the more sell volume from the miners. As their profit margins lower, they are forced to sell a higher percentage of coins,” added Thomas.

Nearly six hours ago, a large bitcoin holder moved some 50 Bitcoin bitcoin, worth more than $500,000 from an off-exchange wallet that has been inactive for 11 years. The transfer was made in one transaction, but the coins were sent split up into two addresses, as reported by a bitcoin and cryptocurrency whale tracking Twitter bot.

The incident not only hit the market due to the influx of supply, but also led to speculations that the old wallet belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto who have left the bulk of his coins unmoved since day one.

Until now, it’s not clear who is the owner of this mysterious wallet and why he had no desire to touch his cryptocurrency stash. Based on what little is known so far, it’s hard to imagine why he developed a sudden urge for cashing in.

With the halving capturing the attention of most investors in the cryptocurrency space as well as some mainstream press, the changes at Ethereum have gone largely unnoticed in the broader crypto community. While BTC has become an investment option for those seeking strong money principles in a time of central bank balance sheet expansion, ETH also represents strong money principles. Ethereum 2.0 has been plagued by delays – a natural part of the software development process but a primary cause of negative sentiment towards ETH. However, Ethereum 2.0 seeks to change from a PoW infrastructure to a PoS infrastructure and the magnitude of this shift, I believe, is not reflected in the price of the token.

ETH deflation - A look at supply-side dynamics

Before diving into the impact that staking could have on ETH, it is important to understand how the ETH “money supply” currently works. As we know, BTC has a fixed supply of 21 million coins and the rate at which these coins are released into the money supply decreases over time. ETH does not have a fixed supply but, like BTC, it has a declining inflation rate:

Source: Ethereum white paper

There is a fixed issuance of new ETH annually. As the money supply grows, that fixed issuance becomes a smaller portion of the total money supply. As with BTC halvings, ETH over time has reduced the block reward for miners. The transition to Ethereum 2.0’s staking mechanism is set to reduce the inflation rate of ETH to 0.5%-2.0%, putting it in the same company as BTC and gold in terms of supply inflation.

I look at ETH as the fiat to BTC’s gold. Despite negative connotations in the crypto community, fiat currencies aren’t inherently bad and the main advantage of an unfixed total supply is flexibility to adjust supply during different economic climates. Central banks have taken this flexibility to an extreme in recent years, and, while ETH’s supply is not fixed, its projected long term inflation may be a happy middle ground between fixed supply and unbridled money printing.

ETH staking - A look at demand-side dynamics

In many ways, ETH trades like a venture investment. Investors believe Ethereum will be the underlying technology for the future of decentralized apps and they buy ETH in the same way they would shares. I find this troubling because, by its very nature, ETH is not a stock and these investors are taking on a bigger risk than they might think.

Staking is the key to making ETH function as a value store. At its core, staking incentivizes holding ETH in a node that can then be used by the network to verify transactions. The greater the number of nodes, the faster the network can function and the more secure it becomes. Staking is not new. Projects ranging from Hedera Hashgraph to Facebook Libra have some sort of staking mechanism built in. But they don’t have the advantage of being the de facto network decentralized app developers lean on.

The magnitude of this shift, I believe, is not reflected in the price of the token.

For investors, there are incentives to staking tokens in a node, including rewards similar to earning interest on a bank deposit. While the staking rewards vary based on network performance and utilization, target returns are close to 10% annually. Though actual returns will vary as the network gets up and running, the possibility of earning returns on coins that would otherwise be in a wallet should entice ETH holders to stake.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

In a global low-rate environment, these returns are certainly attractive. And staking may be the killer app that allows ETH to become a “positive carry asset.” In other words, it generates a positive return for holding it as opposed to, say, gold, which is negative-carry, as it incurs storage costs. Long term, positive carry stimulates demand and creates an incentive to borrow cash to purchase and earn yield. Overall, positive-carry assets increase stability of price movements by creating long term holders and widening the investor base.

Investors are becoming aware of this dynamic. To stake a node, there is a minimum required 32 ETH (thought staking pools can allow staking to be done with as little as 1 ETH). The following chart shows the growth in Ethereum addresses holding 32 or more ETH tokens:

Usage – Stablecoins and DeFi

While generating interest income from staking will certainly be positively received by investors, network usage is ultimately what will create a sustainable system and long-term growth in ETH value.

Investors often consider network usage in the context of dapp adoption and transactions being done, but this misses a big part of the ethereum story. Stablecoins and DeFi have an outsized usage of ETH.

Stablecoins are currently near an all time high total market cap spurred by the broader liquidity crisis in March 2020. This has, in turn, pushed ETH transaction counts to highs around the level seen in summer of 2019.

DeFi is a large source of utilization as well with total USD value locked up in DeFi crossing $1bln USD earlier this year:

ETH as a Store of Value

Current events have forced us to adapt to a more digital life and also shown us the limitation of legacy banking systems. Even the distribution of stimulus checks became a nontrivial problem. With the market focused on bitcoin and its role in unstable economic times, the advances being set forth by Ethereum 2.0 have been largely overlooked. However, Ethereum 2.0 lays out a platform which can help create better digital experiences and ease the friction as individuals and institutions transition to a digital-first world.

As we mentioned earlier, staking will turn ETH into a positive carry asset, which in turn brings price stability and broadens the investor base.

During this pre-sale, Atari Tokens can be purchased with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, three of the most-common cryptocurrencies on the market. Buying with traditional USD is expected to be supported during the next round of pre-sale or during the public launch.

I purchased 100 Atari Tokens this morning for $0.08 each with some Bitcoin and the entire process was extremely simple and bug-free, taking just a few minutes to complete from start to finish. For those interested, I performed the entire process on my iPhone using the Coinbase Wallet app to send the required amount of Bitcoin and the official AtariChain website within the Microsoft Edge iOS app.

Note that bought Atari Tokens remain on the AtariChain website for now but users will be able to send them to wallets that support the cryptocurrency at a later date.

While there are literally hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there, Atari Token is arguably the first one to be created by a company that’s a household name. Atari seems to have a long-term plan for its crypto with it set to initially function as the primary form of currency for its upcoming online casino before tools being made available to app and game developers to make Atari Tokens accessible elsewhere.

An official Atari cryptocurrency wallet is currently being tested for Android smartphones and tablets though it’s likely that a similar wallet app will be developed for iOS and Windows 10 devices as well. Once Atari Tokens are accepted by online crypto exchanges, support for it is expected be added to other popular crypto wallets such as Exodus Wallet, my personal favorite Windows 10 cryptocurrency app.

There are currently several Atari games on iOS and Android that let players gamble for real money and it’s not a stretch to think that support for Atari Tokens will be added to them in future updates. Atari even has some video games on Microsoft’s Xbox One consoles and, while they don’t feature gambling, it’ll be interesting to see if Atari uses such titles to introduce console gamers to the world of crypto. In-game purchases with Atari Tokens wouldn’t be that different from buying skins in Fortnite with V-bucks after all.

Cryptocurrency has been increasing in usage in recent years but it has yet to go properly mainstream and replace regular fiat currencies. The Microsoft Store used to accept Bitcoin for purchases, for example, but eventually removed the option due to the dramatic fluctuations with its price. The company hasn’t given up on cryptocurrency or blockchain technologies entirely though as it is one of the main players in the new Bakkt project designed to aggregate digital assets and simplify the process of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The 50-year-old Muscovite invested $250,000 last year with California-based Cryptolab Capital, which targeted double-digit gains from trading crypto regardless of whether the market rose or fell. But Mr Matveev said his investment fell 98.5 per cent in value when the fund folded in this year’s coronavirus-induced turmoil.

“I don’t really know what happened,” said Mr Matveev, a fund manager-turned-private investor. “They said they had a diversified set of strategies.”

Investors have been drawn to crypto hedge funds by the promise of big returns compared with the paltry or negative yields on offer from cash or bonds. This year, bitcoin has emerged from the big March sell-off as one of the best-performing assets: up 36 per cent for the year, compared with the S&P 500’s 8 per cent fall.

Price discrepancies between the same assets on different exchanges, which have long been arbitraged away in stock and bond markets but still exist in crypto, also offer traders a way to make money. The total value of the crypto market comes to $265bn, according to coinmarketcap.com.

But achieving those returns has often proved a bumpy ride for hedge fund investors. A 39 per cent drop in the price of bitcoin on March 12 caught many funds by surprise, leading to large losses and some fund closures, particularly among those running high levels of risk.

“It’s an understatement to say it’s a bloodbath across the board,” said Edouard Hindi, partner at Mayfair-based hedge fund Tyr Capital. Tyr is one of the better-performing crypto funds this year, up 11 per cent.

Performance in the crypto hedge fund sector tends to swing more wildly than in other, more mainstream strategies, where the arrival of large institutional investors over the past decade has damped risk-taking. Crypto funds on average lost 26.2 per cent in March, according to hedge fund research group HFR, their second-worst monthly loss in data stretching back to 2015 and much greater than the 8.4 per cent average loss suffered by mainstream hedge funds.

But a 19.5 per cent gain last month has lifted crypto hedge fund returns this year to 13.4 per cent, HFR said — much better than the average 6.7 per cent year-to-date loss across the wider hedge fund industry.

“The speed and depth [of the bitcoin sell-off] wasn’t what we were expecting,” said Dan Morehead, former head of macro trading at Tiger Management and founder of California-based Pantera Capital. Mr Morehead said he worked 20 days straight during those choppy markets, including staying in the office until 2am on March 24.

Pantera, which at $500m in assets is one of the sector’s biggest players, suffered a 33.6 per cent loss in its Digital Asset fund in March, although it has recovered to stand up 32.5 per cent this year.

One big source of volatility was the large amount of leverage taken on by some traders, which amplified already-wild swings in cryptocurrency prices. Some exchanges offer derivative contracts that can be up to 100 times leveraged, and automatically liquidate losing positions beyond a certain point, which can exacerbate falls.

“Some futures exchanges offer almost insane amounts of leverage,” Mr Morehead said. “Bitcoin is such high-octane stuff that putting on any leverage is unnecessary.”

Before its collapse, Cryptolab told investors it was developing new trading strategies to profit in periods of high volatility and was aiming to become “more ‘all-weather’”, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times. The firm did not respond to a request for comment.

London-based Cambrial Capital also shut its crypto-focused fund of funds after the March sell-off, although it said this was because of the outlook for fundraising, and planned to focus instead on advisory work.

The treacherous market has not put off some of the hedge fund industry’s biggest players. Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, recently said his funds would be able to trade bitcoin futures, while Renaissance Technologies’ flagship Medallion fund has also been eyeing crypto.

Bulls looking for a recovery believe their argument has been strengthened by central banks’ efforts to combat the economic damage from coronavirus with big cuts in interest rates and extensive bond-buying programmes.

“Cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, are an attractive portfolio hedge against currency debasement and inflation,” billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, founder of Galaxy Digital, told the FT.

A much-heralded halving of the rate at which new bitcoins are produced has also driven interest, including some “wild predictions” about the price, said Manuel E De Luque Muntaner, head of investment firm Block Asset Management.

However, risks remain, not least the lack of a central authority to offer support in times of crisis.

“There’s no government or central bank to come in and save the . . . market,” said Tyr’s Mr Hindi. “In crypto, we have to lick our own wounds.”

On May 18, deposits of bitcoin into tBTC were paused for 10 days – a move prompted by a bug that was supposedly missed by a security audit and was later found by two of the network’s contributors.

That bug, Keep Network revealed in a Medium blog post Wednesday, related to a flaw in the processing of deposit redemptions (when users try and pull bitcoin back out of the system), essentially due to the code’s inability to tell different types of bitcoin addresses apart.

“The team triggered this pause after finding a significant issue in the redemption flow of deposit contracts that put signer bonds for open deposits at risk of liquidation when certain types of bitcoin addresses were used in redemption,” Keep Network, which is behind the Thesis project that launched the token, said in the post.

The team noted that redemptions had originally been restricted to p2wpkh address outputs, but were later widened to include “any other output scripts.” The issue arose if a user tried to redeem pay-to-scripthash (p2sh) addresses. This changed code had not been specifically tested, bar more generally on testnets at a later stage, the post concedes.

“[D]ue to a bug in the redemption dApp in use at the time, the proof step of the redemption flow never occurred,” Keep Network wrote. “These p2sh addresses would have failed validation had the proof step occurred, but reliance on the dApp’s display of a completed state meant the team assumed the redemption had completed successfully, when it in fact had not.”

A second bug was also found meaning that, even if the proof code had been free of issues, a “malicious redeemer” could have specified an output script that resulted in an invalid bitcoin transaction.

Community manager at Blockstream, Daniel Williams, who has an interest in bitcoin and goes by the handle, @Grubles, critically summed up the primary bug in a May 20 tweet, saying:

While the bug and subsequent pause have been a setback for the Thesis team, a new call out has been made to solicit help from code auditors to help track down any further issues.

“We’re also in the market for BTC-focused auditors for round 3,” the team said a Tweet on Wednesday.

The scare brought a quick end to bitcoin’s four-day rally. Prices for the largest cryptocurrency by market value fell to around $9,500 as of 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. in New York) from $9,788 on Tuesday. Earlier Wednesday the rapid sell-off took bitcoin as low as $9,100.

The hourly drop was the biggest tumble since May 10, when a brief outage on Coinbase caused the price of bitcoin to dip 10% in 30 minutes.

Wednesday’s tumble was most pronounced on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, where the price for 1 BTC lost 7% in one hour.

The sudden drop came as crypto traders lit up Twitter after bitcoin blockchain data showed the address, inactive for 11 years, had moved up 50 BTC to different wallets, then another 9.99 BTC earlier in the day. The address’ owner is unknown at present but the coins were valued at around $379,200 at press time.

The market pullback appeared to be exacerbated by the liquidation of heavily leveraged positions on the Seychelles-based BitMEX exchange, where traders can use derivatives known as perpetual swaps to bet up to 100 times their money down.

Spot-market prices briefly diverged from those in derivatives markets, Vishal Shah, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk via a Telegram message.

A price gap as high as $15 opened up between spot exchanges and BitMEX, he said.

“The spot index was higher than perpetual swaps” on BitMEX, Shah said. “This shows that it’s leveraged guys getting liquidated, while the spot bitcoin market is still firm.”

Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations for Bitstamp, told CoinDesk in a phone interview there appeared to be a “large sell order on the exchange” but that operations were functioning normally.",2020-05-20 18:13:30+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/deribit-hits-landmark-bitcoin-open-interest-cme-plays-catch-up/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Deribit’s Bitcoin options surged past 100,000 BTC of open interest. But as CME catches up, recording a 13x increase in open interest during May 2020, is Deribit’s position as the market leader in danger?

The Crypto Options Race

Deribit is the most liquid options market in all of crypto, attracting both retail and institutional investors.

Yesterday, the exchange crossed the 100,000 BTC threshold in open interest with over 10,000 BTC in daily trading volume.

The dominance of Deribit in the crypto options market has been longstanding. Still, the exchange’s place as the venue of choice for institutions could be imperiled as CME’s open interest increased from $13 million to $175 million this month.

Significant hedge funds like Rentech and Tudor Investment Corp that added Bitcoin derivatives to their investment mandates chose CME for the platform’s reputation.

Retail investors are the minority in the Bitcoin options market. If CME options continue to gain traction, Deribit could lose significant market share as institutions move to the former.

Deribit’s saving grace in this regard is the onerous capital requirement to trade CME’s Bitcoin options.

Each option contract on Deribit represents one BTC, while each CME contract is five BTC or around $50,000 at the time of press.

According to Su Zhu and Hasu, authors of Deribit Insights, one must have an initial margin of 40% to trade CME options. This is capital inefficient as it requires the trader to keep a large portion of their trading account dormant.

Further, trading is only available from Monday to Friday, as opposed to Deribit, which is open 24×7.

Institutional liquidity in options may be rising, but CME is the platform of choice only for large funds. Smaller hedge funds and traders, however, will find the capital efficiency and accessibility to be Deribit’s trump card over CME.",2020-05-20 11:16:44+00:00

(Bloomberg) -- Credit Suisse Group AG emerged as the big loser in global investment banks’ race to the exits following the implosion of Archegos Capital Management, with the fiasco leading to a quarterly loss and a major shakeup at the top of the Swiss bank.The firm will take a 4.4 billion franc ($4.7 billion) writedown tied to its Archegos exposure, forcing it to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks. The company’s investment bank head and chief risk officer were among more than half a dozen executives replaced over the worst trading debacle in over a decade.While Credit Suisse was far from the only bank that allowed Bill Hwang’s family office to lever up large positions in a few stocks, others managed to unwind their exposure quickly with minimal damage. That raised questions over Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein’s handle on the firm’s risk just weeks after the lender was caught up in another implosion of a little-known financial player.“Serious lessons will be learned,” Gottstein said Tuesday in a statement. The Archegos loss “is unacceptable.”Credit Suisse has now offloaded the bulk of its Archegos exposure, helped by a $2.3 billion sale this week. But the impact of that latest sale and any remaining positions could affect second-quarter results, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, after the Archegos hit caused a 900 million-franc pretax loss in the first quarter.The firm is still set to give an update on the effect of last month’s collapse of Greensill Capital, which helped manage $10 billion of investment funds the Swiss bank offered to asset management clients. Credit Suisse is leaning toward letting clients take the hit of expected losses in those funds, a person familiar with the discussions said. Analysts expect years of legal costs tied to the matter.For a QuickTake Glossary on the Collapse of Archegos click here“The long-term consequences will be felt in the bank over time” as Credit Suisse needs to prioritize capital preservation over growth, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note.Credit Suisse rose 0.7% at 2:34 p.m. in Zurich trading, paring losses this year to 10%. The bank’s bonds gained in early trading as the dividend cut and suspension of buybacks prevented a bigger hit to its capital strength.Among the executives to leave are investment bank head Brian Chin and risk chief Lara Warner. Gottstein previously removed Eric Varvel from his role running asset management after Greensill’s downfall. In a memo to staff Monday, Credit Suisse also announced at least five other departures, including equities trading chief Paul Galietto.Christian Meissner, the former Bank of America Corp. executive who joined Credit Suisse in October, will take over from Chin next month. Joachim Oechslin will become risk chief in the interim, a role he held until 2019 when Warner took over. Thomas Grotzer was named interim head of compliance.The bank cut its dividend proposal for 2020 to 10 centimes a share, from about 29 centimes, and suspended its share buyback until its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of capital strength, returns to the targeted level. Credit Suisse said it expects a CET1 ratio of at least 12% in the first quarter. It had aimed for at least 12.5% in the first half of this year.Chairman Urs Rohner offered to forgo his compensation for 2020 of 1.5 million francs and bonuses for the executive board have been scrapped for that year. Rohner is set to step down later this month when Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio takes over.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Credit Suisse’s buyback pause and reduced dividend to get its capital position back on track isn’t the cure-all for its financial woes, though may fall short of more bearish fears. Our near-term concerns remain the fallout from Greensill costs, knock-on revenue dents to its prime and asset-management units and elevated control costs, along with lingering regulatory and legal challenges.-- Alison Williams, BI banking analystCredit Suisse Payout Pause Won’t Halt Archegos Fallout: ReactThe Zurich-based bank was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, and had tried to reach some sort of standstill to figure out how to unwind positions without sparking panic, people familiar with the matter have said. The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses.Global banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. have told investors that they shed their Archegos-linked positions with little financial impact. Nomura Holdings Inc. has signaled it could lose as much as $2 billion.Credit Suisse’s latest trades came more than a week after several rivals dumped their shares. The bank hit the market with block trades tied to ViacomCBS Inc., Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and Farfetch Ltd., a person with knowledge of the matter said. The stocks traded substantially below where they were last month before Bill Hwang’s family office imploded.In addition to the Archegos writedown, Credit Suisse may need to set aside 2 billion francs over the coming years for litigation tied to Greensill, according to the JPMorgan analysts.Startup lender Greensill Capital had borrowed from the bank and helped manage a group of debt funds that were marketed as among its safest products. Now the funds are frozen and being wound down after Lex Greensill’s firm collapsed amid doubts about its lending practices.Credit Suisse said it will provide an update on the funds in the “next few days.”Gottstein took over in February 2020 in the wake of a spying scandal that took down his predecessor and pledged a clean slate for 2021 after legacy issues marred his first year.

Whether we mean literal shelter — four walls and a roof over our heads — or something more sophisticated, the craving for a dependable defense against random chaos has always been our instinct.

With the COVID-19 pandemic rearranging society at every level, the allure of a safe haven reigns supreme for our battered psyches. In the realm of financial instruments, the search for the safest of safe havens, also known as a store of value, has taken on a new urgency. Is Bitcoin (BTC) a safe haven? Will cryptocurrency prove to be a store of value above all?

Many Bitcoin believers have been confident in crypto's ability to securely serve as a safe haven. But even the most devout blockchain boosters would admit that the coronavirus is betraying their store of value expectations, at least in the short term, as Bitcoin’s price has not remained resolute since COVID-19 became a global concern. It has exhibited big swings from around $10,000 to a low of near $4,100 in the first quarter of 2020 and now sits at approximately $9,500 at the time of this writing.

While Bitcoin has the potential to shelter value for many more of us than other safe-haven options, we will need a well-coordinated effort among the crypto community and regulators to get us there.

Bitcoin: The birth of a new safe haven

Safe havens have long played a key role in economics and investing. Traditionally, a safe haven has been an investment in an instrument expected to increase its value during market uncertainty. Safe havens add diversification to portfolios and are crucial investment strategy components for retail players and institutional investors alike.

With their deep history in serving humanity’s sense of well-being, there is not surprisingly a long list of safe havens that predate Bitcoin. These include commodities, United States Treasurys and select fiat currencies, equity strategies and hedge funds, as well as more tangible assets such as precious metals (gold and silver), real estate and even art.

Now, cryptocurrencies have been added to that list. Although Bitcoin’s origins are firmly rooted in a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, a funny thing happened on the way to fulfilling those utilitarian aims. Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain-based creation morphed into something much more akin to a security, as long settlement and transaction times make it a less attractive method of payment. Meanwhile, its rise in value over the last decade has far exceeded anyone's expectations: Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class including real estate, gold and the S&P 500.

Bitcoin’s financial status has evolved yet another step and is seen in many circles as a safe-haven instrument. Complete decentralization is at its core, keeping Bitcoin away from the whims of central banking and governments’ appetites for quantitative easing. In a brilliant stroke, digital scarcity is hardwired into its DNA: The supply of tokens is firmly capped at 21 million, a key characteristic that should continue to drive its price higher over time and has led to the widespread perception that Bitcoin equals “digital gold.”

And as a bonus, Bitcoin trumps all other safe havens as a tool for global trade. While that aforementioned transaction time — currently standing at a tick over nine minutes — is unacceptable for buying your proverbial cup of coffee, it sure beats trying to transact with gold bullion over the internet.

Making money safe again

To be sure, Bitcoin has flaws preventing it from becoming a rock-solid store of value. Global regulation of cryptocurrency is still maturing. With few universal rules on how trades can be executed, there is room for market manipulation, which can lead to questions regarding how authentic some crypto price movements are. And while Bitcoin currently trades at gains that are positively astronomical compared with when it first came online, cryptocurrency remains a very volatile asset class.

That shouldn’t stop Bitcoin from succeeding in a big part of its core promise: helping the world’s population to be better prepared for unforeseen global economic crises such as the current market crash that was brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.

In perhaps an ironic twist to Bitcoin’s borderless ethos, this progress starts at the government level. With solid regulation of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, everyday people can be more in control of their wealth. Peer-to-peer lending, instead of loans and mortgage rates from banks, would make loans easier to access for everyone globally, leading to more accessible and affordable credit.

While increased oversight introduces more processes, more regulation also enables the market to progress. A lack of regulation means a lack of trust, which means a lack of adoption — and when there’s a lack of adoption, there’s a lack of markets. Institutional investors stand to see great gains with solid regulation, which will open doors to the mass adoption of products. Investor confidence and trust will naturally follow, as will fresh innovation opportunities, with the overall market capitalization increasing commensurately.

And for a planet under quarantine, crypto only becomes more important. For the 1.7 billion people who are currently unbanked, living under physical mobility restrictions makes sending or receiving money that much harder. Whether they need to transact internationally or with a neighbor, people who are sheltering in place can use layer-two protocols to send crypto payments anywhere and settle within seconds, 24/7. The cost of doing business can also be drastically reduced with crypto, thanks to relatively low fees. In 2019, for example, a $1 billion BTC transaction cost a frugal whale a mere $690 in transaction fees — such a low fee would be impossible to achieve in the foreign exchange markets with interbanking rates applied.

Hedge with education

Better regulation is just half the battle. As has often been the case with all things blockchain, the bottleneck to wider cryptocurrency adoption — therefore making it a safe haven for billions more people — is a lack of reliable information.

We’re more than 10 years into the blockchain revolution, yet only a very small percentage of the global population understands what it is — and even fewer understand its connection to cryptocurrency. When the average person has a firm grasp of the blockchain/crypto ecosystem, adoption will face less friction.

As popular as crypto seems to those of us in the industry, we must exit the echo chamber and accept that it is not in the mainstream. The general public mostly hears about Bitcoin’s large price fluctuations or negative stories about how it could be used in a money-laundering operation. Very few journalists outside of our vertical know what to make of it.

A lot of people use fiat currency without understanding central banks and monetary policy, but they do know how to spend it and access it. Cryptocurrency faces an extra hurdle in that regard: Not only do people not understand it, they also don’t know how to spend or gain access to it.

No wonder, then, that there’s insufficient engagement in cryptocurrencies. We suddenly have thousands of currencies on blockchains, but most people can’t comprehend how a currency can work, or be worth something, without a bank or a government backing it.

Engagement will require more people to grasp what a blockchain does and what the various cryptocurrencies can accomplish in their jurisdictions. Every person in the industry is responsible as a pioneer to educate as many people as possible on the benefits of crypto and how it can become one of our everyday means of payment and value storage. We also need to take some time out of our busy schedules to pass the message on to regulators as to how they can best manage the role of cryptocurrency in the global economy.

When Bitcoin and cryptocurrency make sense to everyone, we’ll truly see it as a digital safe haven — one that diminishes our fear of the economic impact of pandemics and other disasters. The more we can put our time into education and disseminating clear information, not just perfecting our investing, the sooner we can build a bigger boat with blockchain.

An investor in cryptocurrency hedge funds saw nearly 99% of a $250,000 investment wiped out after his chosen fund collapsed during the market meltdown.

""I don't really know what happened,"" Vlad Matveev told the Financial Times.

Matveev detailed Cryptolab Capital's explanation in a Medium blog post: the fund took a leveraged position in March, and a lack of liquidity and rejection of sell orders stopped it from pulling out when crypto prices tanked.

Crypto hedge funds lost an average of 26% in March, while traditional hedge funds lost about 8%, the Financial Times said, citing HFR data.

Matveev outlined Cryptolab Capital's explanation of what happened in a Medium blog post in late March.

The fund's algorithm plowed an amount equal to three times its managed assets into XBTUSD, a leveraged trading product that allows investors to speculate on the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate, Matveev said, citing the fund's managers.

When the market plunged, the managers tried to reduce their position but were thwarted by a lack of liquidity and their sell orders being rejected, Matveev continued. The crypto exchange ultimately auto-liquidated all positions on March 12, he added.

Cryptolab Capital didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Markets Insider.

Many crypto funds were caught off guard when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tumbled by more than a third in mid-March. The funds lost an average of 26% that month, their second-worst monthly loss since at least 2015, the Financial Times said, citing data from hedge-fund researcher HFR.

""It's an understatement to say it's a bloodbath across the board,"" Eduoard Hindi, partner at Tyr Capital, told the newspaper.

Crypto funds trailed conventional hedge funds in March, as the latter lost an average of 8.4%, the Financial Times reported.

However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have rallied strongly since then. As a result, crypto funds are up more than 13% this year, the newspaper said, striking a sharp contrast to average losses of almost 7% for the broader hedge-fund industry.

Since the market rout on March 12, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ bitcoin futures and options contracts have seen significant demand. On May 14, CME Group saw the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (open interest) touch a high of $142 million. Four days later, CME broke records again. Data from the researchers at Skew.com detailed that CME’s regulated bitcoin options open interest is up 10x this month.

Deribit’s Massive Options Volumes and CME Group’s Regulated Bitcoin Derivatives Markets Touch New Highs

Ever since the halving on May 11, there’s been a lot of action when it comes to bitcoin-based derivatives products. The research and analysis team from Skew.com publishes daily information about CME’s bitcoin futures and options, products from Bakkt, and a slew of other exchanges that offer crypto derivatives.

For instance, Skew detailed that the exchange Deribit’s bitcoin options open interest had touched $1 billion for the first time this week. On May 14, CME Group saw $142 million in 10-day combined daily volumes, which is far smaller than Deribit’s volumes but still a milestone for CME. The regulated exchange touched $172 million in total CME BTC options open interest, following the record performance four days prior.

On May 8, CME Group published a blog post about the bitcoin halving and discussed its derivatives products as well. “The emergence of a futures and options market has created a new ecosystem for bitcoin markets, which faces its first supply cut since 2016,” CME Group’s The May 14, open interest breakout for CME Group’s bitcoin options was the first time it has ever crossed $100 million, Skew noted.

Between Deribit, CME, Bakkt, Okex, and Ledgerx the volumes pushed “total bitcoin options open interest to a new record [of] $1.1 billion,” Skew explained. Additionally, “CME bitcoin futures traded nearly $1 billion,” on May 12, 2020 the researchers disclosed.

Bitcoin Halving Fuels Speculation, the Very Driver of Crypto Derivatives Markets

Even Bakkt’s trade volumes increased after the halving, despite lackluster trading volume months prior to the event. “Bakkt had a solid halving session with a record volume day in $ notional, $51.8 million bitcoin futures crossed,” Skew tweeted the day after bitcoin’s third halving.

There’s been a lot of action with ethereum-based (ETH) derivatives products as well. Skew explained on May 21 that “17,500+ Jun20 240 calls traded yesterday on Deribit [at] $10.1 average dollar equivalent price.” When looking at Deribit’s ETH options buy/sell ration Skew said it “reads like overwriting as 76% of liquidity takers were sellers yesterday.”

The market carnage in mid-March was devastating to a lot of traders, and many derivatives players lost their shirts during massive liquidations. The price of BTC has strengthened since it dropped to $3,600 per coin on March 12, and cryptocurrency derivatives markets have seen a great deal of increased action since then as well. Moreover, the third bitcoin halving that took place on May 11, 2020, at 2:30 p.m. ET, sparked even more interest in bitcoin-based futures and options contracts betting on the next few months.

The proposed laws primarily touch the administrative and criminal liability for violation of rules involved in the crypto transactions.

Though the categorization of digital currencies in Russia is not exactly clear, many institutions see them as property.

The latest proposal also clarified them as property and proposed prohibition on their issuance and circulation within the Russian territory.

If enforced as laws, this will prohibit any individual or organization to carry out any operations in digital currencies. This will include payments in cryptocurrencies for goods or services, or exchange of digital currencies.

Heavy fines and prison sentences

The amendments also proposed 50,000 rubles (around $706) to 500,000 rubles ($7,060) fine to any individual and a penalty of up to 2 million rubles ($28,240) to legal entities for organizing illegal circulation in digital currencies or involvement in the issuance of digital assets.

For violating the payments norms, the individuals will be penalized with 20,000 rubles (almost $282) to 200,000 ($2,820) rubles and for legal entities this fine is from 100,000 ($1,412) rubles to 1 million rubles ($14,120).

In addition to the large fines, the authorities can also put the involved parties under imprisonment for up to 7 years, depending on the amount of involved digital currencies and the damage to the country’s financial system.

In all the cases the involved cryptocurrencies will be confiscated by the authorities.

The only way Russian citizens or entities can hold cryptocurrencies is by declaring it to the authorities.

This came when major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance are entering the Russian market, calling a progressive stance of the country’s leaders towards crypto.",2020-05-21 09:49:18+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-is-working-on-a-microchip-that-would-give-crypto-a-cash-like-experience,"In a recent Cointelegraph interview, Charles Hoskinson elaborated on the crypto-native chip that IOHK is working at its blockchain lab at the University of Wyoming that may lead to many groundbreaking use cases, including a cash-like experience for cryptocurrency.

Crypto-native microchip

It all began when IOHK, the company charged with the development of Cardano (ADA), began exploring supply chain use cases and realized that there were no chips on the market that could satisfy its requirements — embeddability, ability to store cryptographic keys, and being inexpensive to produce:

“Really what we noticed is that there's unfortunately no market standard right now for open-source trusted hardware that's sufficiently powerful that it could be used with cryptocurrency, but also could be used in the supply chain.”

Hoskinson stressed that all the work being done on the chip will remain open source and will not only benefit Cardano alone, but rather the entire crypto community.

When Lambo on chain?

The chip could be used in a variety of supply chain use cases, including the authentication and management of luxury goods. For instance, it could be used to determine authenticity of Louis Vuitton handbags or for managing access to limited edition Lamborghini purchases:

“And the only people who are allowed to buy those [limited edition models] are verified Lamborghini customers. And so you see a lot of these things. And so what ends up happening is people who are a verified customer, there's a lottery system and if they win, they have the right to buy it. But almost always they actually sell that right to somebody else and they make a profit. So it's like free money that Lamborghini gives their customers.”

From crypto to physical cash

However, not all of the use cases for the chip involve prohibitively expensive items. Many involve agriculture and the developing world. One of the most far reaching projects would involve, at first glance, a counterintuitive transformation — from virtual currency to physical currency:

“You know, the whole point of Bitcoin was to go from cash to something that's like cash online. But what if you want to go in the opposite direction? What if you wanted to go from a native cryptocurrency to something that has a cache like user experience? It's very difficult to do without a hardware component.”

Cardano believes that the developing world is one of the key markets for the future success of cryptocurrency. For instance, they discovered that in Africa only 2% percent of the six million farmers own smartphones:

“So when you look at that, you say, well, OK, 98 percent are mostly offline and not banked or digital. So if I was building a money system for them, it would probably be a bad idea to say, ‘oh, you have to use an always online, purely digital currency.’ You need some other thing. And so how do I replicate the cash money experience but still have a blockchain backend? Well, what you do is you create a hierarchy where those two percent basically become like micro banks and then they can manage the issuance of these tokens to people and then their local phones or infrastructure can verify.”

Infinitely scalable crypto

The way this would work is that the private key from one chip would be transferred to another. It would also provide the proof of erasure, making sure that the key only exists on the new device. The chip could be embedded into a phone case and would not require the internet for transferring of cryptographic keys:

“So if you can do that, you can basically just tap phones locally with no Internet connection to each other and move value. Like you would a twenty dollar bill from one actor to another actor, and you've replicated the cash experience. Now, what's nice about the solution is it's infinitely scalable because these transactions actually don't occur on the blockchain. So from the blockchain perspective, nothing has happened.”

This is a long-term project that will take years to perfect. One of the concerns for Hoskinson is the shadow of the trade war between the U.S. and China, which could cut into the chip production supply lines. In addition, cryptography is considered to be a weapons system and governments limit its export. Although they may overlook it during the halcyon period, these controls tend to tighten up in times of strife.",,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/82596/shopify-merchants-can-now-process-cryptocurrency-via-coinpayments,"Source: CoinPayments

The so-called ETHBTC token is the first to utilize the “priceless” synthetic token infrastructure developed by Universal Market Access (UMA). UMA is a financial contract platform that aims to build the necessary infrastructure to support the creation of Ethereum-based financial contracts that are less reliant on oracles. It features two main components — a synthetic token issuance platform and a more decentralized price feed mechanism.

Synthetic tokens are assets backed by collateral whose value changes with the fluctuations of its given reference index. In this case, the ETHBTC token is collateralized with the stablecoin DAI, and its value moves along with the ETHBTC index.

The new token is “priceless” in the sense that it does not require on-chain price feed for every transaction. Conventionally, synthetic tokens rely on oracles to track the value of the collateral and monitor whether the smart contract is fully collateralized. However, this approach is widely criticized for being a centralized one because it adds a potential single point of failure.

A priceless synthetic token takes a different approach. Rather than depending on on-chain price feed at all times, the network lets anyone liquidate a position they determine is undercollateralized, based on their own off-chain data reflecting the token’s index reference. If no one liquidates a position, the system assumes that it is properly collateralized. An oracle does not enter the process unless a specific liquidation is disputed.

The UMA team has tried to set it up so these disputes don't occur frequently: a liquidator and disputer are required to make a deposit before resolution, and the losing party forfeits the money.

The new token is now available for trading on Uniswap and is currently worth about 0.02 DAI. The smart contract will expire on August 1, 2020. Until then, the price at which the token trades will increase if ETH performs better than BTC, decrease if BTC performs better than ETH and stay flat if ETH and BTC move in tandem.",

Iranian Crypto Mining

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), energy department and information and communication technology ministries to draft a renewed national strategy for the crypto mining industry. The news comes days after the Iranian parliament published a bill proposing to apply the country’s strict foreign exchange and currency smuggling regulation to cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear why the nation’s crypto policies are being revisited, though some speculate its to prevent value from escaping the nation’s borders.

Tough Drafts

Harsh new rules making many uses of digital assets punishable with fines or prison might soon become law in Russia. Two draft bills setting out how Russia should regulate cryptocurrencies were sent to the country’s parliament, the State Duma, earlier this week. The first of which would prohibit the issuance and transaction of digital currencies in the nation, while the second would impose new sanctions for the illegal use of digital assets. The draft bills have not been finalized, according a high ranking official at the Duma.

Quarterly Loss

Canaan has reported a net loss of $5.6 million and shrinking cash reserves for the first quarter of 2020. Revenues are up 44% quarter over quarter after the firm slashed prices, but it also incurred $9.3 million and $5.9 million expenses in cost of goods sold and R&D, respectively. Canaan’s next generation miners will hit shelves next quarter, though the firm has not provided a business outlook citing the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-Bitcoin halving.

Libra-like Stablecoin

Top Chinese political advisers have proposed a regional digital currency to facilitate regional trade that would be backed by four major Asian currencies including the Japanese yen, Korean won, Hong Kong dollar and the yuan, with the People’s Bank of China leading the proposed effort. The basket of underlying collateral would be weighted based on its nation’s economy, resembling the original vision for Facebook’s libra.

Next of Kin

The kin cryptocurrency may leave its own fork of Stellar for the Solana blockchain. ""The fork of Stellar enabled Kin to reach millions of consumers, but we knew it would not be a long-term solution,"" a draft Kin Improvement Proposal reads. ""Stellar has five-second block times, so irrespective of network load, a consumer could be seeing five-second latency on their transactions – not what we would deem a great consumer experience."" The draft proposal claims switching to Solana would lead to an 84% reduction in kin's latency.

The Kin Foundation published a transparency report Thursday, laying out its structure and operations, in a partnership with Messari and its disclosure database. Notably, 28 million users have acquired kin in the last three years across more than 50 different apps, and are spending 300 million kin per day, the report claims. The foundation’s tokens are vested at a rate of 20% per year.

Blockchain Bill of Rights

The World Economic Forum revealed a “blockchain bill of rights” to protect a crypto user’s right to “manage consent of data stored in third-party systems, port data between interoperable systems” and “revoke consent for future data collection.” Called the Presidio Principles, the document includes signatories from the Government of Colombia, Deloitte, ConsenSys, Electric Coin Company, CoinShares and the United Nations’ World Food Program, just to name a few.

Breadcrumbs…

Anchorage now has six executives in its C-suite, hiring a head of finance and head of sales with experience in both tech and Wall Street. With the new hires, this will be the first time the custodian has employees with “this deep of a bench” running the sales and finance sides of the business, President Diogo Mónica said. “It’s pretty obvious that Anchorage has larger ambitions than its current set of services,” he said. “I think you can start following the breadcrumbs.”

ADAM Hires Blockinger

ADAM, a 15-member crypto trade group, hired Jeffrey Blockinger, a former hedge fund legal chief, as its first chief executive. The agency write codes of conduct for the industry. “I look forward to expanding our leadership role in shaping the future of the digital assets markets by building consensus for the entire industry,” Blockinger said in a statement.

Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule

The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule,” an attempt to extend prescriptive banking regulations to the crypto market, may lead to a bifurcation of the market. “We are going to see white crypto; we are going to see gray crypto. And those different forms of crypto will most likely trade at different prices,” said Bakkt President Adam White at Consensus: Distributed. Other commenters noted that the rule could lead to increased use of privacy coins and regulatory arbitrage between nations that choose to turn a blind eye on exchanges ignoring this global standard.

Finance and the Real Economy Can’t Stay Out of Sync Forever

Jill Carlson, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, argues the imbalance between stock prices, spurred by Federal stimuli, and record-levels of unemployment will rectify sooner than later. “[W]hen I look at the impacts of COVID-19, I see as much slowing down or creaking to a halt as I see speeding up. Our way of life has slowed. Economic time has stopped. For now, financial time has carried on. But there is good reason to think that may slow soon, too, as we realize our spendthrift habits don’t always serve us well,” she said.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Despite recent price volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, 2020 is a big year for Bitcoin. Although a large number of businesses and private individuals are still apprehensive about adopting cryptocurrencies, the number of blockchain-dependent businesses and Bitcoin users is steadily rising — having more than quadrupled over the past three years.

There are several very good reasons why it’s fair to assume Bitcoin is not only here to stay but about to positively flourish.

Related: Is Cryptocurrency Coming Back or Going Away for Good? 6 Experts Weigh In.

Security

Bitcoin, due to blockchain technology, is decentralized. This means that there is no central authority — like a bank or state apparatus — in charge of the currency. Some argue that there are pros and cons to this, but one thing is certain — decentralization provides a higher level of security for the currency. The fact that Bitcoin is not centralized makes it less vulnerable to security threats and more resilient and efficient.

Additionally, while Bitcoin is more pseudonymous than anonymous, transactions are completed under a pseudonym but can still be linked to a physical user. Many users are uncomfortable entering their banking and personal details online, so Bitcoin offers an alternative that, at the very least, appears safer.

Availability

All that’s required to perform transactions with Bitcoin is a smartphone with internet access. Since no physical banking institutions are involved, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have an advantage, particularly in developing countries where traditional banking is lacking or underdeveloped, like in some areas of Africa. Since it’s easier to set up an internet connection than it is to create a physical banking network, Bitcoin is likely the currency of the future for many areas of the world.

Accessibility and ease of use

As we become increasingly used to apps and software solutions for everyday tasks and problems, we’re beginning to expect that ""there’s an app for that.""

If there’s an easier, more efficient way to conduct business or complete service through the use of technology, most people will take advantage of it. And Bitcoin — although its underlying technology is highly complex — is incredibly easy to use.

Borderless transfers

Anyone who’s ever completed an international bank transfer through traditional means can tell you that it’s not the easiest process — and certainly not the cheapest. Online platforms such as PayPal or TransferWise have made it both easier and cheaper than standard bank operations, but there are still fees and configuration issues involved.

Related: 4 Ways to Smartly Invest in Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin, meanwhile, makes it possible to complete international transfers instantly and, most importantly, without third-party fees. This is particularly important for business owners. As markets become increasingly globalized, more and more customers are taking advantage of services and products provided by companies from abroad.

Inflation-resistant

Let's consider basic economics. Part of the design of Bitcoin involves a limit as to how many coins will ever exist — setting the cap at around 21 million. This was a conscious decision on the part of Satoshi Nakamoto, the entity behind the invention and deployment of Bitcoin.

This limit effectively makes Bitcoin inflation-resistant, giving it a major advantage over traditional currencies, all of which are subject to losing value at certain times. The anti-inflationary measures mean that Bitcoin will always retain its value, and also make it a viable alternative to traditional currencies in countries where hyperinflation is rampant, such as Venezuela.

In addition, the halving will occur this year, which will slow the rate of introduction of new Bitcoin into the ecosystem as the total supply marches ever closer to 21 million.

Compatibility

Using Bitcoin — including its implementation in everyday businesses -— doesn’t require any specific alterations or complex systems to be put into place. The cryptocurrency’s accompanying apps and software are compatible with existing technology — smartphones and computers — meaning that no additional investment is necessary to start using Bitcoin.

Potential for increased investing

Bitcoin is valued not only as a currency but also as an investment — not unlike gold or other precious metals. Since Bitcoin appeared on the market, investors have expressed widely different opinions on the cryptocurrency as a potential investment. Some found it to be an ideal opportunity, many believed it too short-lived and/or volatile, and most knew too little about it to have an opinion.

A 2019 survey by Grayscale is highly illuminating on the subject. A sizeable portion of investors — 36 percent — stated that they would consider an investment in Bitcoin. Crucially, though, of the remaining 64 percent — those who wouldn’t consider investing in Bitcoin — a huge 89 percent said their lack of interest stems from having insufficient knowledge about cryptocurrencies.

It’s a logical prediction, therefore, that as the use of Bitcoin as a currency becomes more widespread and understanding of the nature of cryptocurrency more common, investors will be increasingly comfortable with considering it a worthy investment over the coming years.

Lack of superior competition

Superior is the keyword here because Bitcoin is no longer the only cryptocurrency around. Ethereum, for instance, was one of the first competitors to emerge, imitating the technology behind Bitcoin. However, for the competition to be a threat to Bitcoin, it would need to have some specific and tangible advantages.

Fiat currencies have failed because humans can’t help but print more money. There has never been a time where a deflationary alternative built on code and mathematics is needed. Bitcoin has a compelling use-case as a store of value, particularly in countries experiencing hyperinflation such as Iran, Turkey and Venezuela. Bitcoin also has a compelling use case in remittances, and greater adoption by financial institutions will help provide these services at more competitive rates.

One thing is certain: Bitcoin and digital currencies are here to stay.",2020-05-22 18:00:00+00:00,https://capital.com/ethereum-price-prediction-2020,,,https://cointelegraph.com/news/play-to-earn-crypto-gamers-flip-virtual-properties-for-fiat-rewards,"As the world discovers more ways to implement blockchain technology, the billion-dollar gaming industry is leveraging the technology to bring transparency, trust and ownership of digital assets to players. A new vision for blockchain games is emerging — one that aims to bridge the gap between virtual worlds and reality through user commerce.

This notion is being demonstrated by blockchain game developer Uplandme. On May 21, Uplandme announced a partnership with Linden Lab’s Tilia division for leveraging Tilia Pay to enable fiat payments for virtual properties traded within the Upland game marketplace. Currently, the virtual San Francisco properties listed on Upland are traded and purchased by players using the in-game cryptocurrency UPX. Upland’s co-founder, Dirk Lueth, told Cointelegraph that when Upland was initially built, the goal was to create an ecosystem representing a real-world open economy. He said:

“Upland is a virtual version of Monopoly. It’s a trading game based on the EOS blockchain that features real-world addresses in San Francisco. These addresses are all tokenized as nonfungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded and bought using the in-game cryptocurrency, UPX.”

However, in order for Upland to flourish into a truly open economy, a monetization method that would allow players to earn real-world commerce was required. Upland launched its open beta in January 2020 with the promise to exchange digital goods purchased with in-game tokens for fiat money.

According to Leuth, Upland’s vision of a functioning open economy is now achievable through the partnership with Tilia. Linden Lab initially created Tilia Pay to support commerce for its Second Life virtual world, which conducts 1.5 million transactions per day and has an annual GDP of over half a billion dollars. Upland represents the first third-party customer for Tilia, which serves as a registered money service provider and licensed money transmitter.

Upland’s co-founder, Idan Zuckerman, mentioned that the service from Linden Lab will finally allow players to obtain real-world value from digital goods earned through in-game purchases, adding:

“We strongly believe that the future of games and digital property is true ownership; giving players full control over the digital goods they spend time and money acquiring and allowing those goods to retain value in a fair and open marketplace. This partnership helps us fulfill that true ownership promise.”

Bridging the virtual world with reality

Tilia CEO, Aston Waldman, told Cointelegraph that allowing users to extract real-world value within virtual worlds greatly increases engagement, benefiting both players and game developers. Yet in order for this to be achieved, Waldam explained that regulations and licenses are required to move real-world value:

“Tilia has licenses in every state in the U.S., which gives us a unique advantage since no other company has this currently. This is what allows us to move real-world value, like USD, any type of fiat, or cryptocurrencies, between users on a virtual platform.”

Waldman further noted that these licenses allow for a wallet to be integrated within online games, functioning as “in-game bank accounts” that can hold fiat or cryptocurrencies. He added: “The ultimately allows users to extract USD or any other currency out of their accounts, or convert cryptocurrencies to USD to gain profits from goods on the virtual platforms.” Tilia Pay will be implemented into Upland in the coming weeks, putting the platform one step closer to bridging the gap between a virtual world and reality.

Play-to-Earn is the future of blockchain games?

The partnership with Upland and Tilia is also noteworthy, as it demonstrates another instance where a play-to-earn model is adopted by a blockchain game. This is important, as there are certain features naturally built into blockchain games that cannot be offered by centralized platforms. For instance, blockchain games provide true digital asset ownership through nonfungible tokens. On this matter, President of Blockchain Game Alliance, Sebastien Borget, told Cointelgraph:

“Play-to-earn is possible in fiat, without using cryptocurrency, but blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies are facilitators for the payment part, allowing to trade, exchange in a decentralized manner. The game company is not the custodian of a player’s funds and assets.”

Borget further noted that play-to-earn blockchain games are the future of the industry, predicting that this will become a mainstream business model over the next five years, adding:

“I am positive we are getting closer to this mass-adoption moment, as the unfortunate conditions of current world pandemic are pushing players to look for (new) ways to escape the reality of their closed home and apartments by playing video games. Games allow them to express themselves socially in digital spaces, share and interact together.”

Indeed, play-to-earn blockchain games are becoming more common. For instance, Borget mentioned that the flagship game Axie Infinity is growing an active community through sharing tips on how to earn money from crypto gaming.

Related: Fungible Tokens Turn Monopoly Money Into Cryptocurrency

Moreover, Borget shared that The Sandbox decentralized gaming platform, of which he is a co-founder and the chief operating officer, is moving forward with the vision of building out an ecosystem where creators can truly own and monetize their games and creations.

Is it better to earn fiat or crypto?

Interestingly, while blockchain games like Upland are moving toward play-to-earn models based on fiat, some skepticism remains. Venture capitalist Tim Draper told Cointelegraph that these games may be more successful if they stick with cryptocurrency monetization models:

“Upland looks like an awesome game and Second Life has been around for a long time with very loyal customers. However, they might be even more successful if they didn’t worry about converting back to fiat currency. Bitcoin/crypto is just better, and fairly easy to spend now if anyone wants to spend it.”

While it may be too soon to determine which model will reign supreme, Upland did mention big plans for the future now that Tilia Pay is being leveraged. According to Lueth, Upland aims to create an entirely new genre of gaming, one where people interact in digital worlds to generate commerce that can be used in real life. He mentioned plans to eventually bring businesses onto the platform, saying:

“We are in talks with a car manufacturer now, as we want to tokenize cars so they can be traded and sold virtually. We are also thinking about going global and listing properties in places other than San Francisco. The grand vision is for the entire world to be open and accessible from anywhere.”

There are 1.24 renBTC live on the Ethereum mainnet now, according to Etherscan. Three sources with knowledge of the project have confirmed this is the Ren smart contract, live ahead of its launch announcement.

Kain Warwick of Synthetix tweeted Wednesday he was the first person to hold a full bitcoin in renBTC.

However, there’s no way yet for members of the public to mint additional renBTC, the CEO of the company behind the project told CoinDesk in an email.

“While the smart contracts have been deployed on Ethereum, RenVM itself is not actually on mainnet. This is because RenVM is a distinct network separate to Ethereum. The final mainnet subzero version of RenVM won’t be deployed until later,” Taiyang Zhang wrote. “The minted renBTC so far has been from our own internal testing [and] Kain from Synthetix testing the system. The public hasn’t been able to mint renBTC thus far.”

RenBTC becomes the latest in a rash of products built to expose bitcoin-backed assets to the benefits of Ethereum’s various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

Here’s a succinct description of the system from a Medium post by the company’s CTO, Loong Wang:

""Any asset minted on Ethereum by RenVM is a 1:1 backed ERC-20. This means that if you have 1 renBTC (an ERC-20), you can always redeem it for 1 BTC. It's a direct supply peg. renBTC isn't a synthetic, it doesn't rely on a liquidation mechanism, and it's not the price of Bitcoin on Ethereum. It is a one to one representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum that can be redeemed for BTC at any time, in any amount.""

The contracts for the three new tokens are already published in Ren’s documentation. There are also already 1.12 renZEC minted and a negligible amount of renBCH.

Ren is a project that grew out of the $30 million initial coin offering (ICO) for the Republic Protocol, originally envisioned as a way to run dark pools – privacy-preserving trading venues where the order book is kept secret. According to Crunchbase, its backers included Polychain Capital and FBG Capital.

But in a recent issue of The Defiant newsletter, Wang explained his firm’s pivot away from dark pools.

The big trades were on chains that weren’t Ethereum, he said. “ETH had a lot of liquidity, but it was predominantly Bitcoin and USDT. So we would had to leverage things like atomic swaps, and they’re just too painful,” Wang told The Defiant’s Cami Russo. “And so we kind of turned around to say, well, we need to solve this interoperability problem before large liquidity is actually truly accessible in this space.”",2020-05-22 13:07:43+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/interest-bearing-crypto-accounts-a-gateway-for-new-crypto-users/,"The economic uncertainty brought about by the spread of the coronavirus has been the source of much stress and much systemic reorganization over the past several months. As a result–and perhaps somewhat ironically–this seems to have caused an uptick in public interest in cryptocurrency.

This is evidenced in part by data collected by CoinMarketCap: in early May, the crypto data site published a report showing some significant statistics regarding quarterly growth in the first three months of 2020: there was a 43.24% increase in the number of female users on its website; there was also a 46.04% average increase in users 18 to 24 located across the globe.

Also, Yahoo! Finance reported on May 20th that the price of Bitcoin “is faring very well during the pandemic, up 94% since March 16th.”

However, it seems that not everyone who is getting into the world of cryptocurrency for the first time is jumping in headfirst as a full-on Bitcoin hodler or crypto trader.

Instead, it seems that people entering crypto for the first time ever may be taking advantage of an increasingly common product in the cryptocurrency space: depositor accounts that allow users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, commonly known as “interest-bearing cryptocurrency accounts.”

Interest-bearing cryptocurrency accounts originally appeared on the scene as far back as 2014, but didn’t seem to begin gaining serious transaction until 2019, when Bitcoin.com reported a “Cambrian explosion of crypto interest schemes.”

Are “crypto interest schemes” the future of crypto?

Since then, these “crypto interest schemes” have only continued to grow in popularity. Zac Prince, chief executive and founder of cryptocurrency lending and earning company BlockFi, told Finance Magnates that “we’ve seen incredible growth in BlockFi Interest Accounts over the past year.” According to data from LinkedIn, BlockFi was founded in June of 2017.

“As crypto continues to become more familiar to the general population and more people realize how much they could be earning, we expect to see those numbers continue to climb.”

A significant percentage of this growth seems to have taken place in the post-corona era: “to put some of the recent growth in perspective, after launching our new mobile app in beta in late April, we saw a more than 30% week-over-week growth in funded accounts,” Prince said.

Additionally, Celsius chief executive and founder Alex Mashinsky told Finance Magnates in an email that “we just crossed 100,000 registered users and have over $600m in assets on deposit, [and] since March we have seen a tripling of signups with Celsius.” He attributed part of the growth to the launch of what he described as “the first-ever gold token to pay interest in gold (XAUt) with a 4% yield.” Celsius was founded in February of 2017, according to data from LinkedIn.

COVID-19 could be driving interest in crypto, and interest-bearing accounts may be a gateway to the crypto space

What’s driving this surge of interest in crypto–and interest-bearing crypto accounts in particular?

It may well be that as the Fed and other central banks around the world have continued to figuratively ‘turn on their money-printing machines’, individuals and corporations around the world have begun to wonder in a serious way about the security of their financial futures.

This is for several reasons: for one thing, the across-the-board financial market crashes that caused the world to spiral into economic panic in mid-March revealed the fragility of the global financial system. While markets have recovered to a large extent, people and companies around the world seem to have become perhaps wary of the kinds of investments that they would readily make before.

Another level of financial insecurity has been added by economists and analysts who believe that the quantitative easing and stimulus efforts that governments around the world have launched to combat the financial effects of the coronavirus could lead to high levels of inflation in the relatively near future.

Finally, and perhaps most acutely, there are those of us whose jobs and livelihoods have been lost due to the fallout from the coronavirus.

Therefore, individuals around the globe are beginning to question the status quo of the financial world as they have come to know it, and crypto–with its anti-establishment and arguably anti-inflationary doctrine–may seem more viable as an investment than ever before.

Indeed, Celsius’s Alex Mashinsky said in a recent interview with Finance Magnates that unlike investing straight in Bitcoin–which may seem intimidating and risky to most people, even those who are interested in cryptocurrency–interest-bearing crypto accounts are “a product that applies to 100 percent of the population.”

How do interest-bearing crypto accounts work?

These accounts function as an integral part of the cryptocurrency lending industry, which has famously performed extremely well when the rest of the cryptocurrency space was suffering, including during the cryptocurrency “winter” of 2018. The accounts provide the resources that lending companies use to make loans.

Essentially, the concept of interest-bearing crypto accounts “is based on rehypothecation of the assets to institutions to earn yield from interest and then give that back to depositors,” Alex Mashsinky explained, adding that while “each company is different,” he claims that “Celsius has invented this category, and since, others have tried to copy our model or try other models, like DeFi and Crypto.com.”

Celsius, along with other companies in the space, essentially allows users to earn on cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies they deposit into their accounts. “Celsius paid its community over $13m in BTC and ETH interest since its service was launched in June 2018. We believe we paid more interest than all the competitors put together and are the only ones who publish what we earn and what we pay out each week.”

BlockFi’s Zac Prince told Finance Magnates that “interest-bearing crypto accounts are similar to traditional interest-accruing bank accounts, except that the interest rates tend to be higher,” adding that “at BlockFi, they can be up to 8.6% APY for stablecoins.”

Celsius’s Alex Mashinsky said that his company’s wallet provides users with asked to “a basket of non-dollar-denominated assets with yields up to 11%: thirteen [blockchain-based assets] such as BTC & ETH; a gold token which yields 4% in gold; and stablecoins, including [coins pegged to the] British pound, canadian dollar and others yielding 11%.”

Other companies, such as Crypto.com, offer levels of return around 8%, along with a number of other variations on crypto-lending and interest-bearing account services.

How can crypto lending companies offer such high rates of return on interest-bearing accounts?

To the onlooker, the first question may simply be regarding how these companies are able to offer such high rates of return.

Traditional banks can’t offer such high return rates because of that element of volatility in crypto – sometimes it’s a weakness, and other times it can be a real strength,” Zac Prince explained.

“Since crypto is a more volatile asset class, interest rates for loans in this category are higher than they are for traditional assets. That means we’re able to pass that value along to our interest account holders who are providing the capital.”

Celsius’s Alex Mashinsky, on the other hand, believes that “banks can offer higher rates than Celsius, as they earn 13-17% return on capital (see their SEC quarterly filings), but they choose to take all that profit and pay the shareholders dividends and do stock buybacks, while we focus on returning all of that to the depositors.”

”From a big picture stance…what is the risk you are taking for the interest [being earned]?”

In any case, on its face, the process of signing up for an interest-bearing crypto account may seem quite simple: after going through a KYC check, users simply deposit either crypto or fiat currencies into their accounts, and the earnings begin.

However, Alex Batlin, chief executive officer of cryptoasset custody solution provider Trustology, explained to Finance Magnates that while the onboarding process may only take a few minutes, there is a lot more to take into consideration when it comes to the particular kind of service that a depositor is looking for.

Indeed, the way that these accounts work “depends on what you are going for and your risk profile and appetite,” Batlin said adding that the phrase “interest-bearing accounts” can be “somewhat misleading, as it’s not clear on the risks being taken [in exchange] for the interest.”

In other words, a potential depositor in one of these interest-bearing account services needs to think “from a big picture stance.”

“Here’s what needs to be considered: what is the risk you are taking for the interest [being earned]? Is it collateralized or uncollateralized?,” Batlin explained. “Who are you lending to and for what purpose? What’s the credit rating of the borrower, and what’s the risk of the borrower defaulting or the lending platform collapsing, for that matter? “

Therefore, although it may be “exciting that in our space we’re leading with interest-bearing tokens,” the fact remains that “people shouldn’t be fooled as the same risks in traditional finance still apply”–which is to say, low-risk, low returns; high-risk, potentially higher returns.

Risks and returns for interest-bearing crypto accounts

So, what is the risk profile when it comes to a typical interest-bearing crypto account service?

“For uncollateralized lending, where the lending platforms don’t have enough insight into the borrower profiles, it’s high-risk,” Batlin said.

Celsius’s Alex Mashinsky also told Finance Magnates in an email that indeed, “there are many risks when you give out your keys, some have to do with the wallet security… [as well as] the reputation of the lender and their legal status, who is borrowing and their credit stability or ability to repay the coins,” adding that “Celsius requires collateral while others don’t.”

Mashinsky also pointed out that it is in depositors’ best interest to know whether “the company actually is earning any or all the interest you get paid.”

“We don’t believe any other company in the space is earning the rates they pay, meaning they are all subsidizing these rates from investors money,” he said.

Safety and security matters for depositors in interest-bearing crypto accounts

Therefore, when researching interest-bearing crypto accounts, it’s very important to check the typical borrower profile for the company’s lending business. For example, BlockFi’s Zac Prince told Finance Magnates that “we’re able to provide such strong returns for account holders thanks to our business model, which generates interest on deposited assets by lending them to our trusted institutional and corporate borrower[s].”

Additionally, Prince said that “to ensure asset value is retained and loan performance remains satisfactory, we lend crypto on overcollateralized terms and use a highly-trained automated risk management system to monitor positions at all times. We can also terminate a borrow quickly if needed, saving balances to facilitate client withdrawals from interest accounts.”

However, despite the fact that cryptocurrency lending companies may have high standards for borrower eligibility as well as other security measures in place, potential interest-bearing account depositors may be turned off by a general lack of insurance in the industry. Most, if not all,of these firms are not FDIC insured; some may not be protected by any other large-scale private insurance.

So far, none of these companies has experienced a large-scale hack of funds, but BlockFi did experience a data breach last week that resulted in some users’ personal information being compromised.

However, because of the lack of insurance, many of these companies rely on strong security measures to protect their holdings,. Celsius’s Alex Mashinsky said in a recent interview with Finance Magnates that his company “is not a bank–we don’t have FDIC insurance or anything like that.”

Rather, “we rely on having very robust security to make sure that none of our depositors will be affected [in case of a security breach],” Mashinsky said. “We use companies like Fireblocks, and PrimeTrust, and others, who are the technology providers.”

“Fireblocks, for example, has a $20 million insurance policy on their hot wallet–it’s one of the very few companies that has hot wallet insurance,” he continued. “Most other companies will tell you that they have insurance on their cold storage–but when you’re lending coins out the coins are never in cold storage, so the insurance is meaningless.”

“Celsius partnered with Fireblocks to provide hot wallet insurance, so while coins are transiting–either being deposited or being lent out–they are protected as well.”

Interest-bearing crypto accounts could bring new people into the space

Therefore, in a cryptocurrency lending company that operates with high borrower standards and robust cybersecurity measures, the primary risks associated with becoming an interest-bearing crypto account holder are not necessarily liquidity- or custody-related.

Instead, BlockFi’s Zac Prince explained, “the primary risk in crypto interest accounts is the same risk behind crypto more broadly, in that it can be a volatile asset.”

Still, these interest-bearing accounts may provide an accessible, user-friendly opportunity to bring new investors into the crypto space.

“We believe interest accounts are one of the most important tools for scaling crypto adoption, but the delivery and accessibility of products like these are just as important as the interest you can get from them,” he said, adding that BlockFi’s services include a mobile app, and will soon include a consumer credit card that offers Bitcoin rewards. Other companies, including Crypto.com and Celsius, offer similar products.

“If people don’t feel empowered to take the first step and begin their first crypto investment, the interest means nothing.”

In an earnings report released on Friday, the firm said it made $9.4 million in revenue for the first three months this year with a growth of 44.6% compared to the same period last year. But it also incurred $9.3 million and $5.9 million expenses in cost of goods sold and R&D, respectively.

For that revenue, Canaan sold 0.9 million terahashes per second (TH/s) of bitcoin computing power, which accounts for less than 1% of the network’s current total.

That means Canaan had cut the prices for its mining hardware sold in the first three months by more than 50% to just $10 per TH/s, reflecting an overall slowdown of the buying interest into mining hardware amid bitcoin’s halving event and the COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted global logistics.

For context, Canaan booked a revenue of $66.5 million in 2019 with 2.9 million TH/s of bitcoin computing power sold, meaning the average prices was around $22 per TH/s last year. Other major manufacturers have also taken a similar price cut strategy over the past a few months.

“The overall market situation since December last year until January had not been too good. So the unit price per TH/s was indeed lower,” Zhang Nangeng, CEO and chairman of Canaan, said in an earning call on Friday. “And the logistics in mainland China had basically stopped around the Chinese new year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So even though bitcoin’s price was a higher point in February and early March, the pandemic largely affected our sales.”

The filing also shows that as of March 31, Canaan had cash and cash equivalents of $37 million, compared to $71 million as of the end of last year.

“The decrease was mainly due to higher short-term investments as the Company invested RMB173.4 million (US$24.5 million) in short-term investments as of March 31, 2020,” Canaan said in the report.

Zhang said the firm has partnered China-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation – in addition to its existing supply chain partnership with Samsung and TSMC – to roll out bitcoin mining equipment with 14-nm chips and expects to be able to ship in larger quantity in Q2.",2020-05-22 12:17:54+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/albanian-parliament-signs-new-crypto-law-a-bid-to-become-blockchain-hub/,"On May 21st, the Albanian parliament signed a new bill into law to implement a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, which CoinTelegraph described as “Europe’s most comprehensive crypto law yet.”

The legislation seeks to regulate conditions for licensing all cryptocurrency-related activities that take place on an infrastructural level in the country, and was passed with a heavy majority: 88 votes in favor, 16 votes against, and 3 abstentions.

The new law, which is entitled “On Financial Markets Based on the Technology of Distributed Ledgers,” was originally introduced to Albania’s Committee of Economy all the way back in October of 2019.

Minister of Finance and Economy Anila Denaj presented the draft law earlier this week, saying that “the draft law aims to regulate the conditions for licensing, exercising the activity of operators and stock exchanges and supervising them, as well as preventing abusive practices in the market, where severe fines are stipulated for anyone who violates the provisions of the law,” (translated quote).

Will Albania become a crypto industry hotspot?

With the passage of the legislation, Albania becomes the third on the list of European Union countries that have taken independent steps to regulate digital assets. Malta adopted regulations for digital assets in 2018; France followed in April of 2019.

In signing the digital assets framework into law, Albania could be aiming to establish itself as another cryptocurrency “hotspot” for companies seeking to operate within regulated environments. This seems to have worked particularly well in Malta, which eventually became colloquially known as the “blockchain island” because of the high number of cryptocurrency firms that set up shop there.

Indeed, historically speaking, many new cryptocurrency companies have avoided establishing themselves with murky regulations due to the risk of accidentally violating the law, and being punished as a result. Therefore, a number of blockchain and cryptocurrency associations have been formed across the globe specifically for the purpose of advocating for more regulations.",2020-05-22 08:38:15+00:00,,,

As noted by the firm, its active crypto indices are “non-investable” reference indices that have been designed to be “representative of the overall composition of the crypto and blockchain-focused hedge fund universe.”

The Vision Hill Active Crypto Index (VH-ACI) aims to capture the performance of all “actively managed” crypto assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT)-related hedge funds within the firm’s scope.

The company classifies all crypto asset hedge funds into three major categories, including Fundamental, Quantitative, and Opportunistic.

As explained by the firm:

“The VH-ACI (Composite) aggregates all these strategies into one index at the headline level. Sub-indices for each strategy are also available for anybody wishing to reference specific types of managers and strategies, notably the VH-ACIF, VH-ACIQ, and VH-ACIO for Fundamental, Quantitative, and Opportunistic hedge fund managers, respectively.”

During Q1 2020, on a net basis,

the VH-ACI (Composite) grew +8.8% on average,

the VH-ACIF (Fundamental managers) grew +2.4% on average,

the VH-ACIQ (Quantitative managers) grew +17.3% on average, and

the VH-ACIO (Opportunistic managers) grew +16.9% on average.

Meanwhile, passive, public counterparts such as Bitcoin (BTC) fell -10.5% during Q1 2020. Other passive investments such as the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (BITX) dropped -7.7% during the first quarter of this year.

The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) fell -1.5% on the quarter.

Vision Hill revealed that active digital asset managers out-performed “passively holding” Bitcoin (BTC), if we consider active management performance from the beginning of 2018, which represents more than 2-years of observed performance.

However, the company pointed out that these performance comparisons are only metrics “as of a particular measurement point in time, representing only a limited snapshot and should not be considered as long-term indications of performance.”

Vision Hill notes that the digital asset hedge fund sector was not mature enough to provide any “meaningful performance and statistical analysis until the beginning of 2018.”

The company acknowledges:

“The digital asset industry remains highly volatile and in the early stages of development, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. Additionally, strategy specialization, alpha generation, risk management, valuation, and operational best practices continue to develop in the crypto hedge fund landscape.”",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://nypost.com/2020/05/23/baby-al-capone-ellis-pinsky-pulled-off-a-23-8-million-crypto-heist/,"In January 2018, a team of some half-dozen computer hackers — scattered across Europe and the United States — scammed their way into Michael Terpin’s cryptocurrency account, fleeced it and laundered the funds: some $23.8 million, according to a bombshell lawsuit.

Allegedly at the center of the heist was Westchester teen Ellis Pinsky. According to papers filed May 7 in Manhattan federal court, Pinsky is “an evil mastermind.” The suit asks for $71.4 million.

The wildest part? Ellis was just 15 years old at the time of the theft.

To neighbors and classmates at Irvington HS, he was an ordinary 10th-grader who ran track, played soccer, loved cool sneakers and got good grades. Ellis’ bedroom in the $1.3 million home he shared with his family, including his NYU Langone-physician mother, had three computer monitors for playing his favorite games, Counter-Strike and Call of Duty.

But according to an insider, there was at least one unusual thing about Ellis. As related in the complaint, he once allegedly wrote to an acquaintance, “I could buy you and all your family. I have 100 million dollars.” The complaint also alleges that an accomplice saw, in December 2017, “records indicating that Ellis had $70 million.”

Pals outside the heist apparently viewed Ellis as a virtual-money wunderkind. “His best friend thought he was making money through trading Bitcoin and stock,” the ­insider said.

But the complaint alleges that Ellis was the apparent ringleader in the scheme against Terpin, who is a pioneer in the world of cryptocurrency: “In his early teens, [Ellis] began hacking computers with the mission of accessing his victims’ private accounts where they store their cryptocurrency holdings or private information.”

Ellis’ attorney, Noam Biale, told The Post: “Ellis was a child at the time of the alleged conduct . . . It is deeply unfortunate that Mr. Terpin has chosen to bring [a] lawsuit, full of smears and baseless allegations, for no imaginable purpose other than spite.”

Video games were allegedly the teen’s gateway to crime. “Ellis is a gamer. That was his primary interest,” the insider said, adding that private video-game chatrooms — where Ellis was allegedly a regular — on platforms such as Discord and Skype are often full of people bragging about hacks. “From there he got interested in stealing cool usernames.”

Using a technique known as SIM-swapping, hackers remotely transfer a victim’s digital identity from the SIM card that controls the victim’s phone to a blank SIM card in one of the hackers’ phones. Sometimes this is done to steal a victim’s social-media identity, as “OG handles” — such as @A or @evil — can be sold for big bucks.

Ellis also allegedly used SIM-swapping to steal cryptocurrency. Going from nicking names to pulling off multimillion-dollar heists is not that much of a leap, the insider insists: “Once you are in somebody’s phone, stealing valuable names, taking their Bitcoin seems obvious. Plus, stealing crypto is impersonal. For kids who spend their whole lives staring at screens and playing games, it feels natural.”

According to Terpin’s attorney Pierce O’Donnell, Ellis and his crowd were always on the lookout for vulnerable marks. As alleged in the complaint, one of the teen’s collaborators, Nick Truglia, specialized in that task. Four years older than Ellis and a onetime finance/economics major at Baruch College, Truglia’s “assignments included . . . obtaining [a victim’s] cellphone and passcode numbers, conning the mobile-phone carrier into giving him or another imposter a new SIM card and then handing the scam off to [Ellis] to execute the hack,” the complaint states. Last year, Truglia was arrested and charged with another hack. He is currently out on bail. In a civil case, a default judgment was issued against him for the Terpin robbery and he was slapped by a California court with a record-setting $75.8 million judgment.

The case against Ellis alleges that the teen oversaw the hijacking of Terpin’s BlackBerry — which led to his digital vault, called a “native wallet,” where the $23.8 million was stashed. Forty-eight hours later, said Terpin, the thieves had laundered his virtual cash.

“Your phone goes dead and theirs is alive,” he told The Post last year. “Then they own you.”

As the alleged ringleader, Ellis apparently had a knack for organizing and bullying. “He would tell everyone what to do [during heists],” said the insider. “He bragged about [the Terpin robbery] being his job. He’s a very smart guy and a control freak. If you pissed him off, he would start texting you from weird numbers and threaten you. He’d call your parents and say weird things.”

One such alleged victim was a chat-room pal who lived nearby. According to a 2018 report that the 16-year-old pal filed with Eastchester, NY, police, Ellis “made threats to me about having me or my mom killed” after he accidentally let strangers into their chatroom.

Things apparently escalated when the pal was allegedly enlisted by Ellis to help launder the Terpin money and lost some $700,000 after he sent funds to the wrong person. Crypto being what it is, the funds could not be retrieved.

After the money went missing, the pal told police, “[Ellis] asked me to start getting him some money through selling drugs, shoes or in any way possible. He requested $3,000 to $4,000 a week.” It is unclear what, if any, action was taken by authorities.

I could buy you and all your family. I have 100 million dollars. - Ellis Pinsky, allegedly threatening an acquaintance

It seems that Ellis was spending his money — converted from cryptocurrency to cash — to live a high life. As per a JetSmarter ­order form provided to The Post by a source who asked not to be named, Pinsky maintained an account with the private-air service. Additionally, according to the insider, he drove an Audi R8, scored great Rangers hockey seats and dressed in splashy Louis Vuitton and ­Supreme streetwear.

How a kid explains such conspicuous consumption to his parents remains something of a mystery. Said the insider: “I think he told his parents that he made Bitcoin online through video games and got lucky.”

The complaint maintains, “Whether [Ellis’] parents were recklessly negligent or worse in failing to monitor and control their wayward son remains to be seen.”

Ellis’ fly style helped the teen fit in when carousing with fellow hacker Truglia. A photo viewed by The Post shows ­Ellis at the nightclub Up & Down, brandishing an open bottle of Dom Pérignon while flanked by slinky young women. Still, the insider said, “He showed little interest in being at the club. After posing for pictures with bottles, he’d go outside.”

Even while he was spending, the insider added, Ellis kept an eye on his money.

“He had a designer wallet packed with $100 bills but he never liked to pay for anything,” the insider said. “He was an extreme miser. He anticipated retiring from crime after the Terpin heist.”

Apparently, he didn’t anticipate getting busted by his alleged victim. After Truglia’s 2019 arrest, Ellis allegedly text­ed a mutual friend: “[Truglia] is a dumbass . . . and got caught.”

How Ellis Pinsky allegedly spent his stolen loot:

Things appear to have unraveled for Ellis during an investigation of the missing crypto. As Terpin attorney O’Donnell listened to recordings between collaborators in the crime, the teen’s name came up as a key participant. O’Donnell told The Post that he contacted Ellis’ mother at her office, and a lawyer returned the attorney’s call. Although Ellis did not admit to anything, he allegedly took unusual action.

Soon after, according to the complaint, “Pinsky . . . sent cryptocurrency, cash and a watch to [Terpin] without any condition . . . There was no other reason to repatriate these items — worth nearly $2 million at the time — other than to make a partial repayment of what he had stolen from Terpin.”

According to O’Donnell, among the items was a “Patek Philippe Nautilus [watch], worth over $100,000.”

As the civil suit hangs — O’Donnell and Terpin anticipate a response from Ellis’ attorney within the next 60 days or so — no criminal charges have been filed against the teen.

“I want to know why [prosecutors] have not indicted this kid,” said O’Donnell. “He is caught dead to rights.”

A Department of Justice spokesman would only say that “Ellis Pinsky has not been charged by this office.”

Terpin admitted to The Post that he waited until Ellis’ 18th birthday earlier this year to file suit against the teen as an adult. That way, Terpin said, “It will be easier to sue him [than it would be if he was a minor] and we’re intending to get treble damages” — repayment of three times the sum stolen. “These are crypto gangsters. My nickname . . . for [Ellis] is Baby Al Capone.’”

Ellis, apparently, is still living at his mother’s Irvington home, as a Post photographer spotted him there last week.

“Look at Ellis’ life and there is no reason for him to do what he did,” the insider said. “He’s a standout kid with a dark side.”",2020-05-23 00:00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161839-digital-asset-exchange-ftx-introduces-cryptocurrency-trading-for-us-based-users/,"Digital asset exchangehas introduced a crypto trading platform for US-based users.

Russian lawmakers have proposed new laws that seek to ban the use of bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in the country, local media reported.

According to draft bills submitted by a group of deputies to the Russian parliament recently, individuals may face up to seven years in prison and fines of up to $7,000 for using BTC in financial transactions.

People will also be penalized for buying crypto with cash or transferring to accounts opened with Russian banks.

If signed into law, the bills will punish companies that issue or operate virtual currencies without approval from the Russian central bank, with fines of up to two million rubles or about $28,000.

Furthermore, “for violation of the rules for transactions with cryptocurrencies, if they are used as payment for goods or services,” companies would have to pay the equivalent of one million rubles ($13,900) and individuals at least 200,000 rubles ($2,800).

The draft bills were lodged with Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development earlier this week, says a report published by local news company RBC on May 21. One of the proposed laws plans to completely stop digital assets from being used as a means of payment by citizens or corporations.

People that already hold digital assets will be forced to register them with Russia’s tax agency and explain how they acquired them. Another bill proposes to add new sections to the country’s criminal law for illegal operations with cryptocurrencies.

Companies that issue or circulate digital financial assets “using sites registered in Russia or technical equipment located in Russia” are especially liable under this second draft proposal.

Penalties may be compounded for both individuals and firms “if major or especially large damage was caused to citizens, organizations or the state, or if these actions led to enrichment on a large or especially large scale.”

Local lawyers fear that if these laws are enforced, they will paralyze the Russian cryptocurrency industry. Dmitry Kirillov, a senior tax lawyer at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner and a teacher at Moscow Digital School, told RBC:

People who currently own cryptocurrencies will be forced to get rid of them before the law comes into force or risk ‘going underground.’ Goals that will be achieved this way are the direct opposite of what’s being declared. In general, the idea of ​​dropping a crypto ‘Iron Curtain,’ in my opinion, does not contribute to the development of businesses or Russia’s interaction with the world economy on a digital level.

Most recently, the case against Telegram ended with that company abandoning its planned open network and Gram tokens, which raised $1.7 billion. The question before the crypto community is now: Have we witnessed the death of the ICO?

The answer is yes, in that, with all due fear of predictions, we will never see the likes of 2017’s ICO boom again. That vision of an ICO is indeed dead.

This is not the end for new tokens. But, until laws change comprehensively, the massive capital raise that leads to a token that trades freely seems like a thing of the past.

Bird’s-eye view of SEC registration

The SEC came out of two landmark laws passed at the height of the Great Depression. The commission has substantial power over the sale of securities — a broad category of investments that generally entail either stake in an entity or debt to it. They are distinct from commodities, which will be described later. One of the SEC’s most significant powers is seemingly simple: Anyone offering securities to the U.S. public must register that offering with the SEC.

SEC registration requires a company disclose a great deal of its financial information, as well as decision-making power to the public. Not surprisingly, many companies don’t want to. Not that long ago, the assumption was that SEC registration had nothing to do with crypto. That has changed in the past three years.

Since cryptocurrencies don’t fall more obviously into the rest of the potential definitions of securities, their classification depends on the much-contested term “investment contracts.” What exactly constitutes an investment contract is determined by the Howey Test, a critical result of the ruling in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946) that remains the basis of the definition of a security today:

“For purposes of the Securities Act, an investment contract (undefined by the Act) means a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”

The point is that investment contracts entail an investor handing over their money to another entity and, depending on that entity’s work, to see profits. Commodities, on the other hand, derive their value from the market. Different laws govern their trade.

The assumption is that there is no entity that has an overwhelming control over a commodity like oil, so there is no way to register a responsible entity. Royal Dutch Shell, however, has to register with the SEC to sell stock in the U.S., meaning that critical information about their operations is publicly available to anyone, even non-investors.

The guiding principle is that if a firm is going to raise money from public trading, they have to be more transparent than you can reasonably expect of smaller enterprises. In exchange for that transparency, publicly traded companies get access to a lot more capital. Understandably, the SEC’s interest in crypto expanded along with the bottom lines that ICOs were generating.

Brief history of the SEC’s role in crypto: Early years

In the early years of the Bitcoin network, the SEC was slow to involve itself. It was an arcane region of the internet that remained a novelty. The SEC largely either considered it no threat to investors or didn’t know what to do with it.

The SEC’s first Bitcoin-linked prosecution was in 2013. The commission charged Trendon Shavers with running a ponzi scheme promising huge returns based on a unique BTC investment strategy that didn’t exist. At the same time, the regulator issued a general warning to investors against such schemes using virtual currencies.

Fraud that they are, Ponzi schemes fall to the SEC to prosecute because they entail false promises of work from a third party. Shavers’ scheme was not that new. The point of contention in the Shavers case was whether an investment received in Bitcoin could even be considered “money” per the Howey Test. The court found it could, setting a critical precedent.

A new era of SEC scrutiny after the DAO report

The issue of ICOs remained unsettled for years, however. The DAO’s 2016 meltdown during its ICO, in which users invested ETH in exchange for DAO tokens, changed things. The event, which also gave birth to the Ethereum Classic hard fork, also compelled the SEC to issue the DAO Report of July 25, 2017. This report confirmed that The report confirmed that the SEC would not prosecute Slock.it, the firm largely responsible for the DAO. But, crucially, it also determined that the DAO was indeed an unregistered securities offering and, next time, the SEC would not be so merciful.

""Anybody who had been touting [a new token] before the DAO report was ok,"" said attorney John Berry, who left the SEC’s enforcement division in 2019.

Those ICOs that came before the DAO report benefited from some grandfathering in, remaining unscathed if they are demonstrably decentralized. Most regulators accept Bitcoin as a commodity, and if the current CFTC chairman gets his way, Ether seems set to get the same treatment, despite its ICO.

""No, Ethereum can't happen again today, because the first part of the Ethereum story, the capital raise, was a security,"" Philip Moustakis, a founding member of the Cyber Unit within the SEC’s enforcement division, explained to Cointelegraph.

Since the DAO report, the question has been how a new token can come into being that operates like Bitcoin or even Ether. Despite the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto, both of those networks owe their early years to core groups of developers who, were they to operate in the same fashion in 2020, might well face the wrath of the SEC.

On the flip side, Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coin Center told Cointelegraph that:

""I think you could still do Bitcoin. From the beginning of our advocacy in this space, we usually have at least one sentence saying, if you really want to build good decentralized networks, Satoshi was able to build one without a pre-sale.""

He did, however, agree that a project like Ethereum, which held an ICO, would be more problematic were that ICO to happen today.

As an example of a pre-DAO token that is still having trouble with the SEC, Ripple Labs remains busy denying that they were responsible for XRP, a token they retain an overwhelming stake in. One Ripple executive compared the relationship with Chevron’s to oil — a clear attempt to paint XRP as a commodity rather than an investment in Ripple Labs.

But what about the aftermath? Let’s examine some high-profile encounters between new tokens and the SEC.

Block.one and EOS — $4 billion netted relatively peacefully

An interesting case study is that of block.one and EOS. Block.one, a firm that produces open-source software, was the driving force behind the EOS ICO. Netting $4 billion in total, it remains the largest ever. In addition, it is an interesting case study both because the year-long ICO began just a month before the SEC issued the DAO report, and the firm included an advisory on the site for its ICO against U.S.-based investors participating.

The SEC went on to investigate the EOS ICO, but would end up settling with block.one for $24 million. Whether it was just timing with the DAO report, or that the EOS Tokens were non-transferrable after the purchase period, or the fact that the purchase agreement’s explicit prohibitions on investors from the U.S. or China, the SEC didn’t seem to think it had a strong case.

""The fact that the SEC settled for $24 million — I think that indicates that the SEC saw some risk in their position,"" said John Berry. Relative to the capital raised during the ICO, $24 million is peanuts, the kind of expense that a company would gladly chalk up as an opportunity cost. However, it doesn’t provide any security to current projects. Block.one came away from the encounter relatively unscathed, but the SEC did not commit to a public reason.

""I would caution those in the industry against modeling their ICOs after Block.one's,"" said Philip Moustakis. ""To me there's no clear message to take away from Block.one. At best, we're reading tea leaves.""

Moreover, the settlement with the SEC is not the end of block.one’s potential liability for securities law violations. Starting in April, multiple class action lawsuits alleging that block.one violated both federal and state securities law in their ICO. These are still in their early stages, but show that the firm is not entirely out of the woods.

In the same vein as EOS, the ICO for Tezos (XTZ) predated the DAO Report. At $200 million, it was, at the time, the largest in history. Though the SEC never filed any formal action against the firm, a class action representing U.S.-based investors in the project accused the Tezos Foundation and affiliate Dynamic Ledger Solutions of violations of securities laws. The class is currently finalizing a settlement for some $25 million. The same case brought to light that the SEC is investigating the project on the same charges, and the class-action settlement would not necessarily protect the foundation from further SEC pursuit.

The SAFT Framework to appease the SEC

Over the course of 2017, lawyers in the space worked to conceptualize a new framework, a “Simple Agreement for Future Tokens,” or SAFT. Several heavy hitters in the industry released a white paper in October. As the EOS project had done, the SAFT Framework conceptualized a distinction between the initial sale of rights to tokens and the distributions of the tokens themselves.

The first leg would be securities, sold only to “Accredited Investors” using the SEC’s Regulation D to exempt the firm from full registration as a publicly traded company — a step EOS had not taken. That money would go to a registered centralized entity, who could use it to build out the network on which the tokens would operate in a manner free of that central entity. The early accredited buyers would be able to sell their tokens to the general public, even in America, as freely as they can Bitcoin. In theory.

The SEC never formally endorsed the SAFT Framework. However, statements from Chairman Jay Clayton near the end of 2018 indicated support for the concept that virtual currencies can go from being securities to not being securities. In June of the same year, William Hinman, head of the SEC’s fintech office FinHub, made similar comments.

However, the SAFT framework has seen mixed results, and recent events suggest that the SEC is capricious when it comes to firms making the switch from initial funding round to token issuance.

Canadian messaging app Kik got in trouble for using a SAFT in an ICO in September 2017 and remains locked in a deathmatch with the SEC. However, part of their issue was that the app itself was failing, so its Kin token struck many as a lifeboat on a sinking ship rather than an earnest project. Kik had also already had issues with the SEC’s Canadian equivalent.

Often held up as the great success story of the SAFT era, Protocol Labs managed to raise $257 million in an ICO for Filecoin shortly after the DAO report. The firm touted its eagerness to comply with the SEC and decentralize so that Filecoin’s network can operate independently, as a mechanism to provide peer-to-peer file storage. Though by all accounts the SEC is content with Protocol Labs, the firm has yet to launch its network, the most recent estimate being for Q3.

The launch of a mainnet will be the critical test, as Telegram found out. Telegram, the most high-profile project to use the SAFT Framework, is also the most spectacular failure and will very possibly be the last.

Telegram and the failure of the SAFT framework

Last week, Telegram announced that it was backing out of its planned Telegram Open Network. As mentioned earlier, the ICO for TON’s native Gram tokens raised $1.7 billion before the SEC filed an emergency action stopping their distribution in October.

The Telegram case has been brief and heated. The firm tried to follow the SAFT Framework by registering its purchase agreements — NOT the Gram tokens — under a Reg. D exemption. This was effectively a promise to sell those contracts exclusively to accredited investors. The disagreement really starts here.

Per the SAFT Framework, Telegram was hoping that the SEC would accept that the Gram itself was not a security. For its part, Telegram agrees that they had made every effort to keep the SEC involved so as to avoid exactly this sort of action. The SEC’s counterargument was that the Grams were still securities, largely because Telegram had no luck convincing either the commission or the judge that the network, TON, was actually complete.

The state of TON is critical for the “third party” prong of the Howey Test. If the network is still dependent on Telegram’s development, the argument goes, the Gram tokens still constituted an investment in the company’s work.

The issue is that Telegram was verifiably working with regulators throughout the process. It’s spooky for potential future companies looking to raise capital to fund projects that a project with the technical and financial backing of TON wasn’t able to appease regulators and will have to give back a sum of money that puts Telegram itself in jeopardy.

""The Judge basically presumes there would be a crime before there was a crime and is therefore intervening in a way that sends a bad signal to other projects,"" said Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, which wrote multiple amicus curiae briefs defending Telegram in the case. ""From our perspective at the Blockchain Association, this is why we need to have an additional regulator and/or legislative solution that provides a legal pathway.""

What Telegram represents is the collapse of a project backed by the Pavel and Nikolai Durov, two brothers who had already launched two massive online platforms (in addition to Telegram, the Russian social media platform, VKontakte). Moreover, TON seemed well-intentioned and it was clearly well-funded, though Telegram has only offered to return some of the funds invested. The fact that the SEC stopped it in its tracks will be ominous to all future prospective issuers. It’s a new era, and the case is still in court.

In his letter announcing the end of Telegram’s involvement in TON, Pavel Durov concluded by wishing future projects luck:

“You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.”

Right now, nobody is sure how to take up that mantle. In a fascinating development, TON’s open-source version launched shortly before Telegram withdrew its involvement. While Telegram may be hard-pressed to reimburse investors, the functioning of the independent network without Telegram could very well play to their advantage in the court case. The SEC’s argument presumes that the network is dependent on Telegram’s work as a third party. The commission might still maintain that the network was not functional enough to be considered independent as of its original launch date. But if TON works now without Telegram’s active involvement, that certainly strengthens their argument that they were building a project that would leave the confines of the Howey Test.

On the other hand, if the open-source network falls apart, it could prove the SEC’s argument that Grams were indeed investments into Telegram and needed to be treated as securities independent of the initial purchase agreements all along.

Is everything a security by default?

A critical question that still stands is what new projects would be immune to classification as securities.

Speaking with Cointelegraph back in October, U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (R-OH) commented wryly on the position that the SEC has put new projects in:

“They’re literally told if you want to launch a token, whatever you think you want to do with it, come check with the SEC first. [...] And you can grovel. If you grovel well enough, then we’ll give you a no-action letter. You have hundreds of companies waiting on no-action letters. They’ve approved two. You can’t raise capital while you’re waiting for that.”

Philip Moustakis explained that the SAFT framework had underestimated the scrutiny that the SEC would apply to tokens the firms hoped to issue as non-securities:

""Just because there's some distance in time between the sale of SAFT and the sale of a token doesn't mean that the SEC isn't going to consider that token separately as a security. [...] All of what I just said is based on the model of ICOs from 2017, 2018, in which each token represents a share in the issuer’s principal asset, the network on which the token would operate, and that is the original sin that needs to be addressed.""

For their part, the SEC’s fintech wing, FinHub, declined to comment on whether it's possible to hold an ICO within the US without assuming it classifies as a security and also declined to direct Cointelegraph to anyone internally willing to go on the record about recent actions, instead deferring to the same two no-action letters that Davidson referenced back in October — TurnKey Jet and Pocketful of Quarters.

Two utility tokens in closed circuits have passed the Howie Test as non-securities

Respectively from April and July of 2019, TurnKey Jet and Pocketful of Quarters are the only two to have made the cut of no-action recommendations to the commission.

In TurnKey Jet’s case, the commission noted that it is selling tokens so that buyers can buy plane tickets for the same price outside of bank hours — no expectation of profits, and no wallets outside of TurnKey’s system, so the tokens are fairly locked into their value of $1 and occupy a specific role of convenience for a single airline.

Similarly, Pocketful of Quarters operates a gaming platform that offered users unlimited access to tokens at fixed prices. Those tokens, however, had no usage outside of the dedicated platform Pocketful of Quarters had the platform built out without funds from the sale of tokens.

Neither of these ICOs presents any sort of functional cryptocurrency. Instead, they are relatively pedestrian tokens, solving issues of convenience within closed and fairly limited systems.

Utility tokens like these fit more cleanly into Jay Clayton’s analogy of the Broadway ticket that people can trade but which gives you access to just a single show. A classic cryptocurrency that people use as payment for services that do not derive directly from the issuer is a more threatening endeavor. Moreover, the SEC didn’t issue any formal feedback on the matter, so they can retract or reverse any tentative guidance to be derived from these no-action letters.

What about staying out of the U.S.?

One tricky element of digital assets is their ability to cross borders freely. The U.S. SEC plays a major role in global financial regulations due to the size of the country’s economy and investment market.

When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the SEC has claimed potential jurisdiction over any token that could make its way to U.S. investors — given the technological savvy of many in the crypto world, difficult to avoid. EOS, in fact, tried. Many of the people most interested in these investment opportunities are those most capable of operating via VPNs and other technology that fudges geographical origins.

Telegram, in its response to the court’s preliminary injunction barring distribution of Grams, argued that only $424.5 million of the $1.7 billion they had raised was from U.S. investors. They wanted to distribute the remaining Grams, even offering the safeguard of “configuring the TON digital wallet to preclude U.S.-based addresses.”

The court may have reasoned that this was too little, too late. They may also have been sceptical of Telegram’s claims, given that they never believed TON to be complete anyway.

Arguably the most famous example of regulators shutting down a nascent cryptocurrency was Libra, which Congress attacked directly, without the SEC needing to file anything. Much to the annoyance of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Libra set up shop in Switzerland rather than the U.S. And despite the elaborate schema of the Libra Association — which sought to distribute responsibility for the authority through an international union of companies and away from U.S.-registered company Facebook — Congress seemed pretty well-equipped to put the clamp on the project by treating it as a Facebook project and bringing CEO Mark Zuckerberg in to testify. Despite recent updates to the white paper, many still want to label Libra a security.

Why not just register as security tokens?

Not surprisingly, Security Token Offerings, or STOs, have taken on a more visible role. Functioning as professed securities, they use technologies learned from crypto including blockchain to provide quicker, reliable global trading of assets that fall cleanly within the SEC’s basket of what constitutes a security.

Blockstack, for example, sold $23 million worth of its STX tokens after filing a Reg. A+ exemption, a process that reportedly cost the firm millions. No SAFT. STX are functional tokens and remain securities.

To all appearances, Blockstack’s approach seems to be working, in the sense that the SEC has not taken any action against the firm. However, registration as a security limits a token’s trading options.

Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack, weighed in on the challenge STX faces.:

“Internationally in several jurisdictions, it is clearly treated as a utility token — it already trades on Binance, for example. And we got legal opinions from those jurisdictions because the regulations are different and currently there's no U.S. exchange for us. But the fact that U.S. exchanges — either a regulated exchange needs to exist, no license has been given out from the SEC yet for such regulated ATSs [Alternative Trading Systems] or an exchange — or you achieve sufficient decentralization to the point that even in the U.S., it is clearly a utility and not a security.”

Blockstack’s clear aim is to continue decentralizing its token so that it metamorphizes out of the cocoon of security status. Unfortunately, there’s no clear template for doing so within the SEC’s current framework. This presents curious hypotheticals.

""Imagine if the company, say Blockstack, decided to dissolve, but the network continued to run, because it's open-source,"" Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh theorized on the current state of security tokens. ""At that point it's sort of ridiculous. Who is there to file disclosures?""

Many at the SEC are interested in such transitions. In 2018, William Hinman of the SEC’s FinHub commented:

“If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized — where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts — the assets may not represent an investment contract.”

Earlier this year, after the Telegram case had begun, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce began championing a safe harbor for projects looking to decentralize, but the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have completely wiped that proposal off the commission’s radar for now.

Given, however, that the conversation surrounding COVID-19 response has shifted from emergency action to longer-term financial action, we may be about to witness new motions to encourage companies to build and seek capital. For example, the SEC recently loosened its crowdfunding requirements.

""After the last financial crisis, there was the JOBS Act,"" said Kristin Smith, regarding Peirce’s safe harbor. ""A couple of months from now, I think that's going to be a very live and active conversation.""

The Death of the ICO?

Projects will continue to form, and if they don’t ask for money they don’t have to worry about this question. As Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh told Cointelegraph recently:

“Since the beginning of our advocacy in this space, we usually have at least one sentence saying, ‘if you really want to build good decentralized networks, Satoshi was able to build one without a pre-sale.’""

Projects looking for funding, however, are looking at a rough path ahead. Institutional financial players have been examining blockchain technology more intently for private usages, but we’re looking at a new era.

We’ll have to watch out for whether Blockstack can turn its STX into non-securities, or Filecoin can launch its network without an SEC run-in, or even what happens to Telegram and Libra. Without a major change in laws, it’s hard to envision a new major project coming about and transfiguring an ICO into an accepted public currency like Bitcoin, given regulatory hawkishness.

Though this isn’t the end of new crypto projects, the window of time when you could ask for funds to start a new coin and watch it leave your stable seems to be closed. But that’s not to say it won’t open again.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-president-calls-for-launching-a-cryptocurrency-mining-strategy/,"Iranian President Calls for Launching a Cryptocurrency Mining Strategy

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called for a mining strategy throughout the oil-rich nation. The latest statements from the Iranian President follows Iran’s moves to restrict specific crypto trading platforms over “currency smuggling” mandates.

On May 20, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani told the press that the country needs to spur a cryptocurrency mining strategy, in order for the country to prosper economically amid U.S. sanctions. Reports stemming from the regional news outlet Arzdigital which claims Rouhani has told his administration to start drafting a crypto mining strategy for Iran as soon as possible.

Rouhani said that the energy department, the country’s central bank, and the finance minister need to devise a new scheme that welcomes bitcoin miners. This includes Iranian regulatory policy toward mining farms located in the country and taxes.

Iran recently recognized cryptocurrency mining operations as an official industry last year. Iranian officials have already been issuing licenses to farms that are willing to cooperate with the Iranian governments.

In January 2020 it was reported that the Iranian lawmakers licensed over 1,000 mining operations in the country. In the summer months of 2019, Iran represented 2% of the Bitcoin network’s entire global hashrate. Since then however, recent migration has made it so Iran now has 4% of the total hashrate according to statistics.

Rouhani’s statements are a bit confusing after the Iranian government made it harder for international crypto exchanges to operate in collaboration with the country. This week the Iranian parliament released a proposal that aims to curb “currency smuggling” by heightening regulations for international crypto exchanges. Essentially, the Iranian parliament wants the exchanges that are based in Iran licensed and they are required to follow currency smuggling mandates.

Speculators assume that Iran is trying to keep funds from being spent abroad and wants to squash capital outflow by putting pressure on Iranian crypto exchanges for working with international operations. Iran, despite the fact that it is heavily sanctioned by the U.S. is prospering because of cryptocurrency innovation and encouraging the mining industry to migrate to the region.

Data shows that mining farms in Iran are paying as little as $0.01 to 0.05 for hourly kilowatt rates. However, during certain times of the year, the Iranian government has said that electrical rates could shift for mining operations when electricity demand is high.

What do you think about President Hassan Rouhani’s statements about encouraging an Iranian mining strategy? Let us know in the comments below.

Coinbase Custody was reportedly the first digital asset custodian to provide staking and “active governance” for cryptocurrencies residing in cold wallets (offline storage). As explained by the exchange operator, this means that its customers will be able to earn rewards via staking activities and voting without having to risk (potentially) losing their funds.

Cosmos is a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain network that has been developed specifically to enhance interoperability between independent or separate distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks.

PoS assets, such as Cosmos’ ATOM tokens, reward participants that are committing resources to help secure DLT networks by staking (or locking in) their crypto assets to a validator that operates open-source blockchain software in exchange for sharing in the rewards received for mining new blocks.

The Coinbase team noted:

“Staking is an important ecosystem trend and we are committed to helping our clients get the most out of these types of assets.”

At present, Coinbase Custody also offers staking support for Tezos (XTZ) and Algorand (ALGO).

The Coinbase team notes that digital assets staked to a PoS network could be exposed to “the risk of a ‘slashing’ event, where if a validator breaks the rules users have to forfeit a portion of their staked tokens.”

This can happen if the validator goes down or if the validator double-signs a block.

The exchange claims:

“If Coinbase Custody fails to meet certain network standards and slashing occurs, Coinbase Custody will cover this risk and clients will not be impacted by any potential slashing event.”

Coinbase also added support (on May 21, 2020) for OmiseGO (OMG) at Coinbase.com and also for Coinbase Android and iOS apps. Coinbase users may purchase, sell, convert, send, receive, or store OMG tokens.

OMG will be offered to all exchange customers, with the exception of New York (due mainly to strict regulatory requirements and challenges).

OMG is an Ethereum-based token that’s used to run the OmiseGo-based smart contracts platform, which aims to offer users more financial freedom through financial services and investments. OmiseGo plans to help move assets between different payment systems and blockchains, however, the project has been criticized for not moving forward fast enough with its development goals.

On May 21, 2020, Coinbase announced that crypto exchange FTX had chosen the San Francisco-based company as its primary custodian.

The US-based firm confirmed:

“Coinbase Custody will be responsible for the storage of its ERC-20 exchange token, $FTT.”

It further noted:",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/29969/reddit-co-founder-crypto-holdings,"In brief Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian discussed crypto in a new interview.

He said the increased developer interest around blockchains signals a “crypto spring.”

Ohanian also spoke of the role of crypto in his own investments.

Reddit co-founder and executive chairman Alexis Ohanian has long been an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency. But how much crypto does Ohanian, whose personal fortune is estimated at $70 million, hold?

While Ohanian has not specified the extent of his holdings, he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance, published yesterday, that he’s confident with the crypto makeup of his portfolio.

“I’ve had a percentage of my wealth in crypto for quite some time now and I still feel pretty good about it,” he said. “I don’t want to change too much of it, because I do think it’s a prudent hedge.”

Through his venture capital firm, Initialized Capital, Ohanian has invested in crypto startups—most notably as an early investor in Coinbase. More recently, the firm led a $5 million investment round in Horizon Blockchain Games, which develops the card battler, SkyWeaver.

“It’s interesting to see OGs of Wall Street now getting into crypto and buying Bitcoin and the like,” he added, perhaps referencing the recent Bitcoin advocacy by legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones. “It’s increasingly showing that it’s here to stay.”

He characterized all of the recent momenta around blockchain and the industry as a “crypto spring.”

“We really do see a crypto spring right now in terms of top-tier engineers, product developers, designers, building real solutions on top of the blockchain,” said Ohanian. “We’re seeing really top-tier talent building on this infrastructure, and that to me is the best signal of long-term value creation.”

Reddit may help create millions of crypto traders itself thanks to its newly-introduced Community Points, which are rewarded for quality posting on the site.

The Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens can be spent on features on the site or transferred between Ethereum wallets. Only two of Reddit’s subreddits (or communities) have implemented the initiative thus far, comprising about two million total potential users—and Reddit keeps 20% of the doled-out tokens.

Just imagine the potential benefits for both Reddit and Ohanian once the Community Point tokens are rolled out across the site’s entire 400-million-strong user base.",2020-05-23 16:42:24,https://cointelegraph.com/news/moving-coins-data-breaches-and-magical-authors-bad-crypto-news-of-the-week,"It’s been a good week for Bitcoin. The halving doesn’t seem to have done the top cryptocurrency any harm at all, with the dollar value up more than 8 percent over the previous week. Ethereum is up more than 10 percent which just shows that the opportunity for blockchain-based solutions are still red-hot. If you’re taking that opportunity to issue tokens or digitized assets and seeking legal counsel with respect to securities and regulation then you should speak to Josh Lawler at law firm Zuber Lawler. They sponsor the Bad Crypto podcast and they’re specialists in developing technology, including the blockchain.

One person who understands the blockchain better even than Josh Lawler is Satoshi Nakamoto, and it looks like the mystery inventor has been busy. Fifty Bitcoins mined as early as a month after the launch of the Bitcoin mainnet have just moved to two different Bitcoin wallets. It’s not certain that the coins are Nakamoto’s stash but few people were mining with the original Bitcoin client eleven years ago. Craig Wright said that he didn’t move the coins, which is a problem because he also told a US court that the address belongs to him. Oops.

In another mystery move, about $6 million worth of STEEM has been “rescued” in an anonymous transaction on the Bittrex exchange. The tokens, from 64 Steem accounts, were supposed to move to an account called “community321” as part of a hard fork designed to stop “malicious attacks” on the network. The account has asked Bittrex to give them back.

And in an even stranger move Crypto YouTuber Vin Armani has packed his family off to the Northern Mariana Islands. He’s preparing for the zombie coronavirus apocalypse.

With all of that strange movement, it’s refreshing to read a move that didn’t happen. Crypto lender BlockFi has reported a data breach. But no customer funds were lost, it says, which is more than Steem’s hard fork can say. And it turns out that ISIS isn’t really moving Bitcoin around to fund its evil ways. It doesn’t even have $300 million in a secret crypto war chest.

In Congress, the “Advancing Blockchain Act” is asking for a survey of the technology’s uses and its adoption in the US. Representative Brett Guthrie (R-KY) who introduced the bill, says that he’s worried about China taking a lead in the new technology.

Congress isn’t the only place where the blockchain is getting political. The World Economic Forum Global Blockchain Council has launched its Presidio Principles, a kind of Bill of Rights for the blockchain. The sixteen principles include ensuring that participants can understand the risks and benefits of blockchain technology; that they can create, manage, and independently store cryptographic secret keys; and that they can be certain that their data is protected. It would certainly be nice to see China adopt a Bill of Rights.

The principles might just help to protect buyers and sellers on Shopify. The ecommerce platform now accepts cryptocurrency transactions using CoinPayments.

In other news, Ben Mezrich, the author of Bitcoin Billionaires, a book about the Winklevoss twins, has written an episode of the show Billions. The episode focuses on a mining farm in a boarding school. That boarding school, though, is not Hogwarts. J.K. Rowling still doesn’t get Bitcoin, though she has been trying.

And finally, Philip Euphrates Roqueforte (we’re pretty sure that’s not his real name), the Principal Operating Officer, or POO of Coinstool (and we’re pretty sure that’s not his real title), has announced the first part of the Coinstool 50. It’s just a start so it looks like Roqueforte will be pushing them out for a while.

Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has said that he holds a percentage of his wealth in crypto and he does not want to change it. Ohanian believes that Bitcoin is a hedge due to the fact that several “OGs of Wall Street” have now entered the crypto space.

The long-term fundamentals for cryptocurrencies have been improving but the price is yet to catch up. Can the up move resume this week? Let’s study the charts of five major cryptocurrencies that could offer trading opportunities this week.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the medium-term trend is up. However, the short-term has stalled as the price has dipped below both moving averages.

BTC-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The BTC/USD pair has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The 10-day exponential moving average is sloping gradually and the relative strength index is just above the 50 levels, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.

While the best way to trade a symmetrical triangle is to wait for the price to breakout or breakdown from it, another possible strategy is to buy close to the support line of the triangle as this helps in keeping a close stop-loss.

If the bears sink the price below the support line of the triangle, it will be a first sign that the uptrend might be in danger. A break below the channel will confirm a change in trend. However, the end of an uptrend does not mean a downtrend has started as the prices might remain range-bound. The downtrend might start on a break below $8,130.58.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dip to the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This is a positive sign as it confirms demand at lower levels. The bulls might now attempt to carry the price to the resistance line of the triangle, which is close to $9,850. This is the first target objective.

A break above $9,350 could indicate the resumption of the up move. This can offer a buying opportunity to the traders with a stop-loss of $8,950, which is just below the support line of the triangle.

As the pair moves up, the stops can be trailed higher. Traders can book partial profits close to $9,850 and give some wiggle room to the remaining position because a breakout of the triangle will give it a pattern target of $11,778.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows the path of least resistance to the upside. However, the bulls have been facing stiff resistance at the downtrend line.

XTZ-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

This suggests that the bears are attempting to change the trend. If the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels and plunges below the support line of the channel, it will signal a change in trend.

Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend. The 10-day EMA has been gradually sloping up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests that bulls have a slight advantage.

Above the downtrend line, a rally to $3.0603 is likely. If the momentum can carry the price above this level, the uptrend can reach the resistance line of the channel, close to $3.60 in the medium-term.

XTZ-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. However a minor positive is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past two days (marked via ellipse on the chart).

If the bulls can drive the XTZ/USD pair above the downtrend line, the momentum is likely to pick up. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line.

The first target objective on the upside is $3.06. Although there is a minor resistance at $2.963, this is likely to be crossed. On the downside, traders can keep a stop-loss at $2.65. As the price moves up, the stops can be trailed higher. A break above $3.06 can result in a rally to $3.20.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) continues to be in an uptrend. The altcoin resumed its up move following a breakout of the recent highs at $0.0543484 on May 19. However, the sharp drop on May 21 dragged the price back below the breakout level.

ADA-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-day simple moving average on May 22 and pushed the price back above $0.0543484. This move suggested strong demand at lower levels.

Currently, the 11th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has again dropped below the critical level at $0.0543484. However, the positive sign is that the bulls are attempting to defend the 10-day EMA.

If the price bounces off the current levels, the bulls are likely to make one more attempt to scale the price above $0.057555. If successful, the uptrend is likely to continue. The first target on the upside is a rally to the resistance line of the channel.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the price back below $0.050, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A break below the channel will indicate a change in trend. The bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls might be losing momentum.

ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The failure of the bulls to carry the price higher has attracted profit booking. As a result, the ADA/USD pair has again broken below $0.0543484. If the price sustains below this level, a drop to $0.0504050 is likely.

Conversely, if the pair turns around from the current levels and climbs back above $0.0543484, the bulls will again try to scale the price above $0.057555. Aggressive traders can buy 50% of the desired position above the downtrend line and the rest above $0.057555.

The target objective of this trade is a rally to the $0.0615-$0.063 resistance zone. This trade can be protected on the downside by keeping the stop-loss below $0.053.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) has largely been range-bound for the past few days. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between demand and supply.

LINK-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

On May 21, the bulls attempted to resume the uptrend but they could not scale the price above the critical resistance at $4.2129. The bears again aggressively defended this resistance on May 22.

Currently, the 12th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has formed a symmetrical triangle. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the triangle will resume the up move that has a target objective of $4.9127.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the triangle, a drop to $3.4602-$3.2865 support zone is possible. A break below the zone could result in a drop to $3.0473 which is the pattern target of the breakdown from the triangle.

LINK-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation. Although this setup largely works as a continuation pattern, it sometimes can also act as a reversal pattern. Therefore, it is best to wait for a breakout of the triangle before buying.

A breakout and close (UTC time) above the triangle will be the first sign that the bulls have overpowered the bears. Traders can wait for the LINK/USD pair to breakout above $4.2129 before initiating long positions.

The stop-loss for the trade can be kept below $3.7292 because if the bears sink the price below this level, a drop to $3.4602 is possible. Traders can avoid buying if the pair sustains below the triangle.

ETC/USD

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is currently consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the 50 level, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.

ETC-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

However, the balance will shift in favor of the bulls if they can push and close (UTC time) the price above the resistance line of the triangle. Above the triangle, the first target to watch out for is $7.62717 and then $8.4117.

Conversely, if the 19th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A breakdown of this support will signal the start of a new downtrend.

ETC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

Today, the bulls had pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. However, they could not sustain the price above the triangle, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.

Currently, the ETC/USD pair has again dipped back into the triangle but the 10-EMA is acting as a support. If the pair turns around from the current levels and rallies above $6.80, the up move is likely to resume.

Therefore, traders can buy above $6.80 and keep a stop-loss at $6.38. If the bears sink the pair below $6.38, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A break below the triangle could start a new downtrend.

His comments, published on May 22, focused primarily on development rather than markets, remarking that: ""I try not to track prices, I can't predict any of that stuff.""

""What I can say is we really do see a crypto spring right now in terms of top-tier engineers, product developers, designers, building real solutions on top of the blockchain. And that to me is the most interesting part,"" Ohanian, an early VC investor in Coinbase, told the outlet.

""We're seeing really top-tier talent building on the infrastructure,"" he went on to say.

Ohanian's comments come as Reddit is in the midst of testing an Ethereum-based solution for rewarding content creation on its social media platform. As The Block reported earlier this month, two subreddits – one for the popular game Fortnite and another focused on cryptocurrency – are testing token-based ""Community Points."" These points are managed through a user's Vault, which effectively serves as an Ethereum wallet for the rewards tokens.

The tokens are currently in beta and will be in testing mode through summer 2020. Reddit wrote on its Vault explainer page that ""the smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.""

""We continuously run experiments to explore features that engage our users and communities. With Community Points, we're working exclusively with two communities to test this feature and gather feedback from our users,"" a Reddit spokesperson told The Block at the time.

A recent report by Arcane Research and Luno found that Uganda, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Kenya are frequently among the top 10 countries by Google searches for the word “Bitcoin.”

The report describes the continent as “one of, if not the most promising region for the adoption of cryptocurrencies,” emphasizing Africa’s combination of low existing crypto adoption alongside an “enormous” domain possibility.

The firms emphasize that Africa exhibits a young population, frequent monetary crises and currency failures, large unbanked or underbanked populations, and expensive means of payment.

South Africa emerges as crypto hub

While Nigeria has long dominated the continent’s trade volume, the report found that South Africa has the highest percent of cryptocurrency ownership or use among internet users in Africa with 13%, followed by Nigeria with 11%.

Worldwide, South Africa ranks fifth for crypto adoption among connected citizens.

This past week saw South Africa post its second-strongest weekly volume on peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace Localbitcoins, with nearly $1.65 million worth of BTC changing hands.

Weekly Localbitcoins trade volume: Coin.dance

The surge in trade activity saw total P2P volume for South African trade edge out Kenya last week with $1.95 million in trade across Localbitcoins and Paxful.

Last month, South Africa’s financial regulator issued a policy document asserting that crypto assets and activities relating to virtual currencies “can no longer remain outside of the regulatory perimeter.”

P2P volumes surge across Africa

Nigerian P2P trade is rallying to record highs, producing $9.2 million in combined weekly trade.

Kenyan trade has also seen a recent spike, with Localbitcoins trade between BTC and the Kenyan shilling producing its second-strongest week on record for the third consecutive time.

Morocco and Egypt have also posted record trade activity in recent weeks.

The increase in volume across the continent has also seen P2P volume from Sub Saharan Africa beat out Latin America for the first time.",,https://www.coindesk.com/spiritual-reflections-on-the-bitcoin-halving,"Allen Farrington writes at Quillette, Areo and Merion West as well as extensively on Medium, where he has several much longer essays on bitcoin, finance, economics and related topics. His collected writings can be found here. He lives in Edinburgh.

At approximately 8:23 p.m. GMT on Monday, May 11, the 630,000th bitcoin block was mined, the first to offer the reward to its successful miner of 6.25 bitcoin rather than 12.5, as has been the case for the past four years. You may have caught wind of this, what with #BitcoinHalving briefly trending on Twitter, an uptick in coverage of bitcoin in the media over the past few days, or for some other reason.

There are good ways and bad ways to describe “the halving.” Or rather, there are ways that are factually true and then there are ways that are spiritually true. Whatever mainstream coverage you read on this – if you found any at all – I would bet took the factually true route. They will have told you something like the following:

Miners secure the network by wasting electricity solving useless mathematical puzzles. Whoever solves the puzzle first gets a reward and all the pending transactions get logged. The reward just halved, meaning the supply to the market will likely contract, leading many to suspect the price will go up, while others disagree. So far markets have done…

Then whatever markets did in the following hours, which I really don’t think is important at all. It is factually important, for sure. But it is not spiritually important. And to ignore the spiritual importance is to misunderstand the halving entirely, just as it is to misunderstand Bitcoin. It is only spiritually important what happens to the price of Bitcoin over years, decades, and centuries.

The halving was not just the mining of the 630,000th block. It was a social event perhaps unlike any other in history, and perhaps even never to be repeated. Previous halvings (this was the third) were celebrated in bars, beaches, and barbecues, as I am sure this one would have been in normal times. But given the lockdown, the celebrations were migrated to Zoom, YouTube and Twitter, for the most part.

Many thought this a shame, reminisced spending previous halvings – or previous get-togethers of any kind – in person, and looked forward to being able to do so once again whenever normality returns. But I think the circumstances forced their own beauty, their own poignancy. Not everybody can afford to go to New York on a random Monday in May, but everybody can afford to turn on YouTube. The lockdown meant everybody in the world celebrated the halving in the same place: on the internet. In Bitcoin’s home.

And so rather than take planes, trains, and automobiles to the bars, beaches, and barbecues, tens of thousands of individuals tuned in live from all over the world for what – factually – was little more than a countdown. Many likened it to New Year’s Eve, but it was different for at least two reasons, one factual and one spiritual.

Factually, the event itself can only be said to exist on the Internet. It was not “in a place,” except insofar as it was in every place. Unlike New Year’s, therefore, it happened for everybody at the same time.

But spiritually, the importance of this universality really cannot be overstated. The halving happened at the same time for everybody because the Bitcoin protocol is the same thing for everybody. It knows no borders and no nationalities. It knows no time zones. One might say it is its own reference time. The halving didn’t happen at 8:23 p.m. GMT – 8:23 p.m. GMT happened at block 630,000.

Similarly, the halving didn’t happen at ~$8,500 BTC:USD, it happened at 1 BTC:BTC. There will be a time when no “exchange rates” matter or are even meaningful. In anticipation of this, I would encourage the adoption of a different, more consistent metric – perhaps bitcoin’s share of the aggregate global capitalization of currency? Bitcoin is its own reference value.

Bitcoin’s reference time is the same for everybody, as is its reference value, as is its reference software, as indeed are its engendered social celebrations. Provided you have an internet connection you can use bitcoin to tell the time, to transfer value, to inspect its code and to join the party.

Moreover, these must be the same for everybody, because they exist as references in the first place because Bitcoin, the ecosystem, strongly encourages nonviolent agreement. Bitcoin has elevated the importance of the word “consensus” in the English language, and its translations in every language, for that matter. Bitcoin is written in C++. This is the factual reason that everybody can read it. The spiritual reason is that it is open source, and that it must be open source for consensus to form and be maintained.

Every block has a field called coinbase, which the lucky miner may fill with a limited string of text that has no strictly functional purpose in terms of the code, but, due to the open source nature of the blockchain, anybody can read, and hence can be used as a kind of meta-tool for signaling purposes. The very first block ever mined by Satoshi Nakamoto was given the following text as its coinbase:

The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

Factually, this served as a timestamp. Spiritually, it served as a statement of purpose: a call to arms that cheekily elucidated why this radical experiment was even being attempted. It was soon discovered after the halving that the coinbase of the 629,999th block, the last to reward 12.5 BTC, was filled by mining pool f2pool with the text:

NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue

I won’t insult this astonishing gesture by explaining its content. I wish merely to draw attention to its beautiful duality; factually, this achieves nothing. It is a throwback: an impressively well-executed meme.

But spiritually, this is a battle cry. Because here we are again, twelve years and goodness knows however many trillions of unbounded dollars later. Bitcoin is no longer an experiment. It is a nonviolent revolution against financial tyranny, led by nobody, fought by anybody and everybody. And it is literally trolling its way to victory.",2020-05-24 13:00:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/market-outlook-golden-cross-invalidated-andreessen-horowitz-predicts-fourth-crypto-cycle/,"Market Outlook: Golden Cross Invalidated, Andreessen Horowitz Predicts ‘Fourth Crypto Cycle’

The price of bitcoin and a number of other popular cryptocurrencies have been collectively holding a market valuation of around $255 billion. The fiat value of these cryptocurrencies has slipped downwards during the last four days. Despite the weekly losses of around 3-6%, many digital currency proponents are still very optimistic. Mainly because of how well crypto markets have performed during the coronavirus outbreak and the global economy’s current hardships.

Entire Crypto Market Cap Still Hovers Above a Quarter of a Trillion US Dollars

Digital currency supporters can safely say that so far, crypto assets have performed extremely well since the March 12, 2020 market carnage, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday.’ The entire crypto economy of over 5,000 cryptocurrencies is currently worth $255 billion using today’s exchange rates. Today, BTC is trading for $9,156 per coin and has around $4.8 billion in 24-hour global trades.

Ethereum (ETH) is swapping for $207 per unit and there’s just under $2 billion worth of ETH trade volume on Sunday. The digital currency XRP is still commanding the third-largest position by market cap as each coin is trading for $0.19. The stablecoin tether (USDT) is the fourth largest market valuation today and the USDT market is worth $5.74 billion.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) lost its footing price wise, as well on Wednesday, May 20, 2020. At that time, BCH was trading for $247 per unit, but today each coin is swapping for $233. The BCH market cap is worth $4.3 billion today and tether recently eclipsed the coin’s market share. In fact, close to 100 million USDT was created on May 23, 2020 according to Whale alert data.

On Sunday morning, 70% of BCH trades are in tether, which is followed by 17.4% worth of BCH/BTC swaps. Additionally the top trading pairs with bitcoin cash include the USD (3.06%), KRW (2.35%), ETH (2.32%), GBP (1.50%), and the stablecoin USDC (0.59%). Bitcoin cash has around $99 million in total global trades on Sunday.

Andreessen Horowitz Predicts a ‘Fourth Crypto Cycle’

Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz executives have recently published a blog post called “The Crypto Price-Innovation Cycle.” Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin say that a “fourth crypto cycle” is on the horizon. “Even though crypto cycles look chaotic, over the long term they’ve generated steady growth of new ideas, code, projects, and startups— the fundamental drivers of software innovation,” Dixon and Lazzarin wrote in the post.

“The 2017 cycle spawned dozens of exciting projects in a wide range of areas including payments, finance, games, infrastructure, and web apps— Many of these projects are launching in the near future, possibly driving a fourth crypto cycle.” Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on how Andreessen Horowitz raised over $515 million for a cryptocurrency-focused fund.

Golden Cross Decline

Despite the recent “golden cross formation,” BTC prices saw a 3% loss since May 20, 2020. This particular golden cross predicted a bullish scenario for BTC. Essentially, the 50-day moving average (MA) and 200-day MA initiated the golden cross, but the price never followed the traditional northbound outcome. Even though the golden cross came to fruition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has not shown any bullish signals whatsoever.

Although, it is hard to measure the market with divergence, especially when weighing the options of a reversal. While the 50-day and 200-day MA had shown a definitive golden cross, the market trade volume just hasn’t been enough to push prices forward. Various traders were hoping for some kind of indication from the golden cross event just as they do for the death cross. Unfortunately, the BTC chart indicating the formation of a golden cross, was meaningless this time around.

Sponsored by state rep Mark Wright, the legislation – filed earlier this year – seeks to create a process by which companies that focus on cryptocurrencies can seek and obtain licensure in Louisiana. Wright has previously pushed for a crypto-focused regulatory regime in the state.

The legislation would also create definitional language for crypto exchanges and a range of terms related to ""virtual currency."" As noted by CoinDesk, the bill echoes a past proposal from the Uniform Law Commission's Virtual Currency Business Act, which grew out of a multi-year effort that dates back to 2015.

The Louisiana House of Representatives approved Wright's measure on May 20 unanimously, receiving 92 'yeas' via roll call.

The three pillars that we’ve had faith in all our lives — institutions, government entities and the media — have all failed us. From trusting financial institutions to guard our assets to expecting politicians to enact smart policies to hoping the media informs us on issues truthfully, we’ve entrusted these institutions to have the public’s best interest in mind and to provide crucial guidance in times of crisis. Instead of witnessing any of that, we have seen politicians, government agencies and the media fail catastrophically in the critical, early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the few reasonable voices offering practical advice coming from Silicon Valley — insiders sounding “five-alarm fires” from their personal social media accounts.

As they say, history has a way of repeating itself, and if we’ve learned anything from the financial crisis of 2008 — which bailed out the wealthy banks and left a large swath of the population struggling and jobless — it’s that the centralized institutions put their own interests in front of ours.

The 2008 crisis destroyed the public’s trust in the banks and eventually led to the birth and proliferation of cryptocurrency. This genesis moment for cryptocurrency occurred, as it became evident that banks, and associated third parties, were unable to safeguard people’s assets. People wanted to permanently remove, on a structural level, any financial middlemen masquerading as “goodwill” actors and to control their own money and their own destiny.

There are similar patterns that we can identify between the fallout from the financial crisis of 2008 and the current crisis we’re living through — and how trust in all three pillars has all but disappeared nowadays. During this pandemic, we’ve realized that:

Institutions have completely failed us. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention was not ready to react on any level. The World Health Organization was primarily concerned with China’s complacency rather than offering real help and guidance. The Food and Drug Administration’s policies were outright harmful to the American public, ranging from forbidding at-home testing to forcing local “COVID meetups” at hospitals. The government and, in particular, politicians have failed. The federal government was clearly confused. At first, it tried to save pennies for airlines (keeping air travel to China open) that ended up costing trillions of dollars. It spread confusing and contradictory information; defunded agencies; and had no plans, no equipment, no strategy and no reliance on science or hard data. The completely non-partisan nature of this crisis made it especially damaging for politicians. The American public received a stark reminder that while politicians on both sides were busy with a ritualized Kabuki theater performance of mock political battles over the past few months, they paid absolutely no attention to the matters that became life and death factors for millions of people just a few weeks later. The media has failed. Mainstream media completely missed the crisis and played it down in the first few months, fueling the storyline that the virus was “just the flu” and disseminating outright false and dangerous misinformation. The rapid and exponential growth of the pandemic offered a reality check far faster than the media is accustomed to, and authors of dangerously incompetent stories were faced with harsh accountability for the results of their “research” and “fact-checking” in a timeframe they never experienced in their professional careers. This resulted in the widespread mistrust of the media with its clear inability to inform the public, or even just having the discipline to research the correct answers in the first place.

Stemming back to its early days, the crypto industry has always had a hint of doomsday gloom around its narrative. After all, why would anyone need this marvel of a cryptographic peer-to-peer decentralized financial network if we can simply trust governments, media and institutions to just do their jobs well? As it turns out, our current reality is uncomfortably close to what cryptocurrency enthusiasts always feared they must prepare for in a dystopian future that is now our present day.

The need to replace legacy social systems based on blind trust with decentralized alternatives that are based on fundamental mathematics to empower the individual is now extremely clear. We can expect the natural reaction of the tech-savvy public to be similar to the last crisis: For every centralized institution that claims “we know what’s good for you so just trust us,” we’ll begin to see the emergence of a decentralized alternative that people will actually trust — not because they blindly delegate that trust, but because the “source code” of that distributed network and its rules of operations (oftentimes as the literal source code) will be visible to everyone in the network to review and improve upon.

The intertwined roles of fundamental cryptography and decentralization will quickly grow in our society once we get out of the immediate needs of dealing with this current crisis. After the dust settles, the outcome will be a second genesis moment for fundamental cryptography to power up many verticals shifting to distributed and decentralized alternatives. What will be the most interesting industries to put on the watchlist?

Education: The shift to online education and homeschooling will go from a light drizzle to a torrential downpour. As a side note, it will be an interesting moment in California politics when the teachers union’s interests for political self-preservation will come in direct confrontation with every parent’s desire for physical self-preservation. That will mean that teachers — who fully embrace the online-first experience and make internet classrooms work 10 times (if not a hundred times) better than their less tech-savvy peers — will need reputation and compensation rails to be built outside traditional educational structures. “Blockchains eat online education” might be the best answer for that challenge.

Media: The importance of independent media that can ring the alarm bell or shine a light on developing issues is now more apparent than ever. Unfortunately, such media exists only in our imaginations as fantasy heroes of the Pentagon papers style movies and books. The real media is a fading empire of failed corporations with a decaying business model that is trying to compete (and losing badly) with tech corporations for the same advertising dollars. Their employees are not heroes of the past but are, instead, an overworked and under-compensated workforce with a narrow short-term focus of content production for for-profit corporations. These legacy media organizations are allowing employees to produce a depth of coverage and attention span akin to that of a goldfish rather than prioritizing news in the public’s best interests. These organizations’ ability to be alerted, to research and to provide smart and timely science and data-based guidance is, frankly, zero at this moment.

We’re now entering a new era of self-reliance that incorporates finding our own trusted sources of information, compensating them outside of for-profit media models and bringing about a grassroots style of citizen-journalists that fully own their own broadcasting power. Instead of a few dozen major media outlets, we will follow thousands of experts who can provide deep and extremely specific coverage for any domain. Substack, Twitter lists and YouTube podcast stars are already filling that void. Adding cryptographic artifacts for reputation and compensation will only accelerate that trend.

On-demand workforce: With COVID-19 likely becoming a seasonal malady alongside the regular cold and flu, remote work will become the default setting with a highly flexible workforce — not bound to any geographic locale — that will be instantly available for any specialized task. The “on-demand” workforce will become just the “workforce” in exactly the same way the “mobile phone” became just a “phone.” As always, distributed and decentralized trustless network corporations will want to see unforgeable proof of professional capabilities and past performances while professionals will want to receive guaranteed payment in undiluted assets (that might be radically different from colored paper printed by the host country). Both of these challenges flow natively into blockchain-based solutions. After a few years of adjusting to this new normal, we might see the modern workforce becoming similar to the vision laid out in classic cult hit Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson. Knowledge work will become simply something anyone can “log in” to from any place on the planet and at any time for as long as they are willing to contribute. This COVID-19 crisis might be just the forcing function that will make the sci-fi novel entirely real.

We have already started seeing the green shoots of progress that will define how society learns and evolves from this crisis. The biggest winner of all might be the philosophy of libertarianism that shuns large institutional solutions and prefers to bestow all the power on the technologically educated and empowered individual. This might be the catalyst we needed to shift public opinion toward libertarian solutions after seeing such an abject failure of legacy models.

This will usher in an age of reason based on science, research and, most of all, data and facts. Individuals joined in myriad reputational, professional and financial networks will be able to reach an online consensus and enact policies with speed and intellectual depth unseen by any previous generation. And that, perhaps, will be the most lasting positive change in the post-COVID-19 world.

Everyone has heard of Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and other big exchanges, but few of us could name any or many of the so-called ‘second-tier’ exchanges. These are smaller exchanges that don’t grab the headlines and don’t trade massive volumes, and given the fact that they largely fail to distinguish themselves, it’s hard to imagine that most of them will survive in the future.

However, traders and experts working within the industry believe that there is a place for smaller, second-tier exchanges, and that the best of them do offer things bigger exchanges don’t. So while many smaller exchanges may fall away in the coming years, there will be a harder core of other second-tier exchanges which do survive and which help make the exchange sector more competitive.

What are they?

Right now, CoinMarketCap lists 341 cryptocurrency exchanges, although more than 500 are listed on other directories.

That’s a lot, and even with the more successful second-tier exchanges, there’s the suspicion that they don’t really do anything to distinguish themselves from larger rivals. As Multicoin Capital’s Mable Jiang wrote in a recent tweet:

I've been thinking: if there's no product differentiation, why some of the second-tier exchange still exist today?… https://t.co/wGEakQJPxm — Mable Jiang (@Mable_Jiang)

Yes, it may be hard to see why a smaller exchange that does nothing differently or better should survive among bigger rivals. Nonetheless, most analysts and traders affirm that the better second-tier exchanges do offer services you can’t easily find elsewhere.

“Some second-tier exchanges have found opportunities in OTC (over the counter) and other services that provide some differentiation,” says Simon Dingle, the founder of Inves Capital and author of In Math We Trust.

In particular, Dingle tells Cryptonews.com that second-tier exchanges often provide trading opportunities in a wider pool of coins, and/or in coins that other exchanges don’t list.

“Offering boutique and niche services, such as arbitrage in markets where such opportunities exist, has been very lucrative for some of the smaller exchanges out there that know what they're doing, like Ovex.”

On top of this, Dingle notes that many of the best second-tier exchanges are local exchanges, offering services only in particular nations that are more tailored to local needs and requirements.

Likewise, Multicoin’s Mable Jiang tells Cryptonews.com herself that, while it’s hard for second-tier exchanges to compete with big platforms in terms of mature products such as spot trading, there’s “more than enough room for new product innovation.”

“For example, we have observed the traction that FTX gained when it first launched leverage tokens and some ETFs,” she explains.

“Similarly, a second-tier exchange in China called Pionex.com offered bot-trading products to its users to hedge their risk against the market volatility; similarly, they too gained significant organic growth despite zero marketing efforts.”

Jiang also affirms that the opportunities for second-tier exchanges can be found in derivatives, options, and products with sophisticated trading strategies.

Ethics, transparency, simplicity

More simply, certain analysts and commentators believe that second-tier exchanges differentiate themselves from the big boys simply by offering a more transparent and ethical service.

“Honestly, the main thing is to not be so scammy,” says Jimmy Song, a venture partner at Blockchain Capital and a Bitcoin developer/educator. “Most top level exchanges do very shady things like fee for listing, which I think hurt the industry quite a bit.”

In addition, some make things simpler by focusing on only one or two cryptocurrencies, or by introducing a simpler fee structure.

“I've seen a bunch of exchange startups do different things that differentiate them, like being Bitcoin-only (Swan, Cash App) or having a different fee structure (Level),” Song tells Cryptonews.com.

On the other hand, some experts also take something like the opposite view. That is, some second-tier exchanges attract custom because their small size and under-regulated nature means coins can rise in price dramatically.

“The only advantage they have compared to the big brothers is they are too small to be on the radar so they can be more ‘wild,’” says Anndy Lian, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency and blockchain advisor and author.

“You seldom see a coin goes 100x on big exchanges but it’s still happening on second-tier and small exchanges.”

Of course, wild price swings and a lack of liquidity (or transparency) may not be a good longer-term strategy for survival. In fact, Jimmy Song suspects that regulation may be the undoing of many second-tier exchanges going forward.

“The biggest problem right now is that the incumbents, especially in the US use their regulatory moats to their advantage. They're not ahead on technical innovation, they're ahead on regulatory compliance. This is a sad state of affairs as the best innovations don't win.”

The future: consolidation?

Given that the likes of Binance and Coinbase are expanding internationally, analysts believe that some degree of consolidation in the exchange sector is inevitable.

“If there are a handful of them and they fail to differentiate in terms of product offering, there will likely be some consolidation among them,” says Mable Jiang.

Also, according to her, it is less flexible for large exchanges to try out new products given the size of their customers, but second exchanges can be more agile in terms of testing out different innovative products.

Jiang believes that the best second-tier exchanges will find a niche for themselves for some time to come. This is mainly for two reasons:

providing local on/off-ramp services, listing small-cap cryptocurrencies that the bigger exchanges may have missed.

Prices fell by 9.8% last week to register bitcoin’s biggest weekly decline since the second week of March, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. A two-week low of $8,630 was registered early on Monday, with prices last seen at $8,730 – down over 11% from the post-halving high of $9,960 registered on May 18.

Despite the price drop – or perhaps because of it – the number of addresses holding smaller amounts of bitcoin has continued to rise.

The number of unique addresses holding at least 0.01 BTC (around $87 at press time) rose to a new high of 8,478,746 on Sunday, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC (roughly $870) also rose to a lifetime high, reaching 3,053,004 on Friday. Both metrics regained their upward trajectory following the May 11 mining reward halving.

“Retail investors are likely in an accumulation phase,” said Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.

The dip demand may be associated with the bullish narrative that bitcoin could repeat history by charting a solid price rally over the next 12 months. The cryptocurrency witnessed a 30% pullback in the four weeks following its second reward halving on July 9, 2016. However, the decline was erased in the subsequent months and prices rallied to record highs by March 2016.

Prominent trading firms are also retaining a constructive outlook on the cryptocurrency. “The price pullback was expected and the long-term bias remains bullish. We would accumulate if prices drop to the $6,000-$8,000 range,” said Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP capital.

That said, the growth in the number of small addresses does not necessarily all represent new individual investors. This is because a single user can hold cryptocurrency in multiple addresses.

Exchanges and custodial services also tend to hold bitcoins in multiple addresses. “Wallet management systems of virtual asset service providers have become more complex and granular. Their wallet clusters include more small wallets for security, etc.,” said Ju.

As such, it is difficult to gauge exactly how much of the small address growth has been driven by new investor participation.

Even if small investor participation is increasing, it is unlikely to have a big impact on prices because the market is still dominated by large players, popularly known as “whales.” The number of addresses holding at least 10,000 BTC and 1,000 BTC have declined over the last two weeks, according to Glassnode data.

Moreover, options market activity suggests a deeper price drop could be in the offing in the near-term. “Traders are buying out-of-the-money puts,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.

A put option represents a bearish bet on the cryptocurrency, while a call option represents a bullish bet. An out-of-the-money put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset.

Thomas expects bitcoin to move toward the $8,000–$8,200 range in the short term. That looks likely, as per the charts, as the cryptocurrency has breached a trendline rising from March lows.

Daily chart

Bitcoin fell by 5% on Monday, violating the support of the 2.5-month-long bullish trendline marked. The breakdown is backed by deeper bars on the MACD histogram, a sign of strengthening bearish momentum.

“However, the relative strength index is neutral (going sideways),” Yuriy Mazur, head of data analytics at cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, told CoinDesk, while adding that “there is no clear understanding where BTC will go currently. It may either retrace back to $6,500 or reach $10,000. We may get a clear indication of the further direction in the nearest days.”

The immediate bearish case would weaken if prices rise above Sunday’s high of $9,310 on the back of strong volumes. That said, a convincing move above $10,000 may be needed to restore the bullish trend.",2020-05-25 11:54:46+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-miners-in-sichuan-province-ordered-to-shut-down-in-orderly-manner/,"Regulators in China’s Sichuan region have sent a notice to all cryptocurrency businesses within their jurisdiction to call for a swift end to all mining and mining-related activities. Municipal administrators and subordinate offices in Sichuan have also been directed to “guide” miners to shut down their operations “in an orderly manner.”

The mandate is particularly significant because of the sheer amount of Bitcoin hash power (computing power) that is generated from the regions–according to PANews, which covers the Asian blockchain industry, it’s estimated that 9.66 percent of the Bitcoin hash rate is generated in Sichuan.

Miners in Sichuan have been targeted before

Home to branch offices of Bitmain, AntPool, and other major mining corporations, Sichuan has long been recognized as one of the regions of the world with the most conducive conditions for Bitcoin mining. The region is known for its cheap electricity (much of which is sustainably generated during the rainy season) and naturally cool climate–factors that the Bitcoin mining industry finds very attractive.

Therefore, it may not come as much of a surprise that this isn’t the first time that local authorities in Sichuan have gone after miners in the region. In late December of last year, Chinese news outlet 8btc reported that the local government in Sichuan’s Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has recently demanded a cleanup in the region’s mining sector.

2) Just a while ago, local governments of some marginal poor areas of the province encouraged crypto mining to digest excess hydro-electric power. The order is expected to negate these supportive measures of these local governments. #crypto #BTC pic.twitter.com/UPiIzZpAX7 — PANews (@PANewsOfficial) May 22, 2020

While a total shutdown of all mining operations in Sichuan will certainly change the global Bitcoin hash power landscape, the shift won’t necessarily bring in more mining power from outside of China: other regions in the country, including Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Yunnan, are also home to large percentages of the global Bitcoin hash power supply. Like Sichuan, these regions also have access to cheap electricity and inexpensive labor.

Sichuan’s anti-Bitcoin-mining ordinance was implemented on a regional level, so it won’t affect these other provinces. However, it’s unclear whether other provinces in China may eventually follow suit with ordinances of their own. After all, the federal Chinese government has taken a rather anti-cryptocurrency attitude.

Still, pro-blockchain policies and remarks by Chinese President Xi Jinping have paved the way for the blockchain industry in China to continue to grow. In fact, the National People’s Congress is currently in the process of reviewing a bill that would create a national blockchain fund.",2020-05-25 09:00:54+00:00,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-altcoin-btc-dominance-bitcoin/,"BTC dominance – a metric that weighs the entire Bitcoin market cap against other crypto assets – has been falling in recent weeks, giving many small-cap altcoins a chance in the limelight.

The short-lived altcoin season could come to an abrupt end, however, according to a highly reliable indicator.

BTC Dominance To Grow, Putting Sudden End To Crypto Alt Season

Bitcoin is the first-ever cryptocurrency, and everything else across the market ranging sans stablecoins, from Ethereum to Dogecoin is considered an altcoin.

Though these assets are very closely related, their relationship in terms of price action is incredibly unusual.

Oftentimes, when Bitcoin is pumping, altcoins will grow right alongside it in terms of USD value. On other occasions, altcoin capital has directly flowed into Bitcoin further fueling its parabolic rise.

When Bitcoin crashes, altcoins are usually obliviated. The prime environment for altcoins to shine tends to be when Bitcoin is trading sideways.

And because each unique altcoin has its own price chart in terms of USD and BTC pairs, oftentimes crypto analysts look toward an aggregated metric such as BTC dominance to shed some light on what may happen between Bitcoin and altcoins.

Prior to Bitcoin’s 2016 halving, BTC dominance had not fallen below 97%. As soon as it did, it was a catalyst for the crypto hype bubble and dominance falling to an unprecedented 35%.

Since then, BTC dominance recovered to a high of 73% before falling to current levels. However, a reversal to retest highs above may be next, according to a highly accurate signal.

TD Sequential Signals Bitcoin Overperformance Compared to Altcoins In Short Term

The TD Sequential indicator has presented a buy setup on BTC.D price charts, depicting Bitcoin‘s weight against the rest of the crypto market.

While its arguable as to how effective using BTC dominance charts are for analyzing crypto assets, the signal itself has proven highly accurate again and again across the crypto space.

The tool, created by market timing wizard Thomas Demark, called Bitcoin’s top at $20,000, bottom at $3,200, and another bottom at $6,400 late last year.

It even signaled a sell set up just ahead of the historic Black Thursday market collapse that sent Bitcoin price tumbling back to lows around $4,000.

Altcoins have been suffering against Bitcoin for over two years, and are well overdue for a recovery. This recovery may need to wait a bit longer if this signal plays out on BTC.D charts and altcoins take an unexpected hit.

As interest in cryptocurrency grows among institutional investors, global investment banks, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are reexamining their views about bitcoin. Goldman Sachs is hosting a call for its clients to learn about the implications of current policies for bitcoin, gold, and inflation.

Goldman Sachs’ Bitcoin Call for Clients

New York City-headquartered investment bank Goldman Sachs is hosting a call for clients on May 27 entitled “US Economic Outlook & Implications of Current Policies for Inflation, Gold and Bitcoin.” Goldman Sachs’ Investment Strategy Group, part of the firm’s Consumer and Investment Management Division, has issued a notice inviting clients to the call where they can learn about bitcoin.

Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Goldman Sachs’ head of Investment Strategy Group and chief investment officer for Wealth Management, will host the event. She is responsible for the firm’s overall strategic asset allocation and tactical investment strategy.

Two other economists will join her for the call. One is Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and professor at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). The other is Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist and head of Global Economics and Markets Research. According to the firm, Hatzius is also a two-time winner of the Lawrence R. Klein Award for the most accurate U.S. economic forecast, including during the global financial crisis.

Goldman Sachs Schedules Bitcoin Call Amid Rising Institutional Demand for Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, have been gaining interest among institutional investors. A recent report by PWC and Elwood Asset Management shows that cryptocurrency hedge funds’ assets under management have been growing steadily, rising more than $2 billion at the end of last year. “I expect the crypto hedge fund industry to grow significantly over the coming years,” PWC partner and global crypto leader Henri Arslanian said.

Institutional investors have been gaining exposure to bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies via Grayscale Investments’ products. The company revealed that the majority of its record-high investment in the first quarter (88%) came from institutional investors, dominated by hedge funds. Most went into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). It was further revealed that the company bought a third of all bitcoin mined in three months. The average weekly investment in the first quarter was $29.9 million in Q1 2020, a substantial increase from $3.2 million in the same time period last year. Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert hinted that the purchase in the second quarter will be even higher. “Just wait until you see Q2,” he tweeted.

An increasing number of billionaire investors are also increasing their investment portfolios’ exposure to bitcoin or recommending bitcoin as a hedging strategy. Among them are Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya, Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, and famous hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Several economists and analysts have predicted that more institutional investors will be investing in cryptocurrency post the covid-19 crisis, such as this Japanese analyst and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce.

Investment firms, like JPMorgan Chase, that were previously skeptical about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are coming around and beginning to embrace them. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon used to call bitcoin a fraud but later regretted making the statement about the cryptocurrency. In addition, JPMorgan Chase is recently said to have accepted two bitcoin exchanges, Coinbase and Gemini, as banking clients.

Many people in the cryptocurrency community view Goldman Sachs’ bitcoin call as a bullish move for the industry. “Bitcoin is inevitable, all who have gone against it are now being forced to kneel, first JPMorgan, now Goldman Sachs,” one Twitter user wrote. “Even banks realize fiat money is losing value … The race is on,” another tweeted. A different Twitter user chimed in: “After having criticized bitcoin so much, calling it a scam, Goldman Sachs is now feeling the wind shift. Many opponents will do the same by changing their opinions in the months and years to come. The bitcoin revolution will take place with or without their support.”

Goldman Sachs has not released the details of what aspect of bitcoin it will discuss during the call, drawing an array of speculation on social media. While some are optimistic, others believe the hype may be premature. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the worst recession for India and believes that a deep and prolonged recession would warrant negative interest rates in the U.S. despite Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dismissing the strategy.

Banks, credit card companies, exchanges, and other institutions have been asked to be on high alert and report ""suspicious"" activity.

The move comes as the government battles the flight of devalued pesos from its economy, as Argentines seek dollars and other more stable currencies.

Argentina's government is cracking down on crypto trading in the country in order to stamp out money laundering and other illegal activity. But the country’s latest measures against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may, in fact, have more to do with an attempt to prevent further devaluation of its national currency, the peso, according to observers.

According to a report from Argentine newspaper El Cronista, the country’s Financial Information Unit (FIU), a government agency that monitors compliance with anti-money laundering laws, is seeking tighter controls on cryptocurrency trading.

""Recently, we have seen an increase in operations carried out through virtual assets,"" FIU President Carlos Alberto Cruz said in a statement last week. These transactions “could be carried out by people who intend to circumvent international standards and avoid the [anti-money laundering] framework,” he said.

The FIU said it aims to gather more information on individuals and entities involved in crypto trading and ordered a large swath of institutions, ranging from banks and credit card companies to exchanges and mutual funds, to report suspicious activity. Other entities, such as mail and shipping companies, stock brokers, NGOs, and even art galleries and sport leagues, will be under greater scrutiny by the FIU.

But the timing of the move is telling. As El Cronista noted, the FIU order comes at a time when the government is in the midst of battling “parallel exchange markets” that see Argentine citizens dumping pesos for more stable, foreign currencies.

As Franco Amati, founder of the Buenos Aires Bitcoin Center, explained on Twitter, the Argentine government is essentially trying to prevent the practice of citizens buying Bitcoin with Argentine pesos, and converting those Bitcoins to US dollars on foreign exchanges.

Argentine government wants to stop the ""bitcoin dollar"" (buying BTC with ARS inside Argentina and converting those BTC to USD abroad). 🤦‍♂️😂 Let's see how that works: https://t.co/ikrkB3OwD1 — Franco Amati 🦔🌎⚡ (@franamati) May 21, 2020

This while Bitcoin trading volume in Argentina is on the rise, increasing at almost the same speed at which its economy has been declining. Argentina, in fact, began 2020 with a significant spike in Bitcoin trading on peer-to-peer exchanges, and BTC has at various times during the year traded at a premium within the country. (Curiously, the same was also briefly true of the DAI stablecoin, which is also very popular in Argentina.)

Other observers similarly took to Twitter to voice their concerns. Prominent Venezuela-based crypto trader and analyst David Battaglia condemned the measure as a ploy designed to ""confiscate the little wealth that Argentines have left.""

Ellis Pinsky was 15 when he allegedly began his scheme, through which he has stolen more than $100 million in cryptocurrency as ""the ringleader"" of what a federal lawsuit calls ""a sophisticated cybercrime spree,"" court papers show.

""I could buy you and all your family… I have 100 million dollars."" - Ellis Pinsky (Lawsuit, page 5 of 27)

But the teen's habits and mysterious wealth apparently never raised alarm bells at his high school or even at home in Westchester County.

""His best friend thought he was making money through trading Bitcoin and stock,"" an ­insider told the Post, under the condition of anonymity, later adding: ""I think he told his parents that he made Bitcoin online through video games and got lucky.""

But Pinsky could only stay out of the spotlight for so long.

Cryptocurrency bigwig Michael Terpin sued Pinsky, now 18, and several other unidentified people on May 7 alleging the teenager bilked $23,808,125 from him, and stole tens of millions from others who are not named in the complaint, court papers show.

""On the surface, Pinsky is an 'All American Boy.' The son of privilege, he is active in extracurricular activities and lives a suburban life with a doting mother who is a prominent doctor,"" the lawsuit states. ""Despite their wholesome appearances, Pinsky and his other cohorts are in fact evil computer geniuses with sociopathic traits who heartlessly ruin their innocent victims' lives and gleefully boast of their multi-million-dollar heists.""

Terpin is seeking treble damages – three times the amount of the actual money lost – or more than $71 million, in addition to attorney fees and related costs.

""These are crypto gangsters,"" Terpin told the outlet, adding that his nickname for Pinsky is ""Baby Al Capone.""

Pinsky's attorney, Noam Biale, emphasized to the Post that he was just a kid at the time.

""It is deeply unfortunate that Mr. Terpin has chosen to bring [a] lawsuit, full of smears and baseless allegations, for no imaginable purpose other than spite,"" Biale said, according to the report.

Biale did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request seeking comment.

Pinsky and his accomplices, the lawsuit alleges, hacked into victims' computers and their cryptocurrency accounts and stole the holdings, which they then laundered. In some cases, they would also allegedly steal personal information to get access to the accounts.

""Look at Ellis' life and there is no reason for him to do what he did,"" the insider told the Post. ""He's a standout kid with a dark side.""

The lawsuit describes how Pinsky's text messages paint a picture of a “wannabe Master of the Universe,” who thought himself invincible and boasted about his wealth.

""I'm well off I'm good I don't need extra money I'm set for life,"" he allegedly wrote to one person.

He allegedly spent millions on pricey watches and nights out at New York City clubs, and was ""constantly reaching out for the support of equally callous offenders who think nothing of stealing millions from their victims to live a life of conspicuous consumption,"" the lawsuit states.

The foundation in Pinsky's scheme began to crack after an accomplice, Nicholas Truglia, was busted following a separate cryptocurrency theft from 2018, according to the suit. Truglia, whom Terpin sued separately, ultimately identified Pinsky and a number of people ""as his confederates in cryptocurrency thefts.""

Truglia, court papers allege, ""described Pinsky's integral role in the theft"" of Terpin's funds. ""Along with other highly incriminating evidence, Truglia's detailed account of Pinsky's penetration of Plaintiff's accounts and how he unlocked the unique secret to the passcodes for his crypto-wallets conclusively demonstrates that Pinsky was one of the hackers,"" court papers further show.

No law enforcement charges have been filed against Pinsky.

As world governments push through legislation to levy taxes on capital gains from bitcoin (BTC) transactions, seeking to earn more from an asset class that frowns on regulatory oversight, there are still a few countries that remain pro-crypto, allowing investors to buy, sell or hold digital assets at zero taxes.

Circumstances vary, but the real motivation leans more toward facilitating increased investment within the respective jurisdiction’s cryptocurrency industries, perhaps as a base for future taxation. For now, that has not happened yet. Here’s a list of eight countries – in no order of importance – which may be considered as bitcoin tax havens, states that don’t want your BTC investment gains.

Portugal

In Portugal, tax authorities waived all tax on cryptocurrency trading and transacting – meaning that individuals do not have to pay capital gains tax or value added tax (VAT), when buying or selling BTC and other digital assets. The Portugal Tax Authority (PTA) said “an exchange of cryptocurrency for ‘real’ currency constitutes an on-demand, VAT-free exercise of services.”

While citizens are under no obligation to pay income tax when exchanging crypto for fiat, the PTA, however, indicated that businesses which accept digital currencies as payment for goods and services are liable to paying taxes such as VAT and income tax. The income tax relief makes Portugal’s laws some of the most favourable throughout the world, given how income tax is a huge expense on the accounts of most crypto traders.

Germany

If you hold bitcoin for one year or more in Germany, you won’t have to pay any taxes. Regardless of how much money you make selling your BTC, you do not pay capital gains as long as you have held your coins for a period exceeding 12 months.

Europe’s biggest economy regards BTC as private money, contrary to the widespread view in most developed countries, which look at crypto as currency, commodity or equity. In Germany, private sales that do not exceed 600 euros ($654) are tax-free. Businesses, however, are still obliged to pay taxes on gains emanating from bitcoin through corporate income taxes.

Singapore

Both individuals and corporates who hold BTC or other digital assets as a long-term investment are not taxed in Singapore – simply because capital gains tax does not exist in the city-state itself.

However, enterprises based in Singapore are liable to income tax, should they be involved in cryptocurrency trading as a core business. Those that opt for bitcoin as payment for services rendered, or revenue, are subject to normal income tax rules. Companies are taxed on the profit generated within Singapore.

Malaysia

As with neighboring Singapore, there are no capital gains tax in Malaysia. Cryptocurrency trades involving cash or another digital asset are not taxed in the Southeast Asian country. However, this will likely change if BTC is recognized as legal tender in Malaysia, as has been rumoured in the local press in recent months.

Belarus

In the Eastern European country of Belarus, a new law that came into effect in March 2018 legalized cryptocurrency, exempting individuals and businesses from any form of taxation for dealing in or with digital financial assets in whatever way, at least until 2023.

Individual activities such as mining or buying and selling of crypto, are considered personal investments, and therefore, are not subject to tax. Similarly, registered businesses operating in the special economic zone of High Technologies Park near the capital Minsk, involved in mining, trading, initial coin offerings or other crypto-related operations are not taxed.

Slovenia

For Slovenia, the tax system for individuals and companies involved with BTC is rather different. While no capital gains is levied on citizens for the sale of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they are still expected to pay income tax regardless of the currency being exchanged. However, companies that receive payment in BTC or from crypto mining are required to pay tax at the corporate tax rate.

The taxation of corporations “depend on the circumstances of a particular case and the information provided in the declaration: income recipient status; type of income. If profits are recognized as capital gains, then the tax is 19%,” say experts.

Malta

The famed “blockchain island” of Malta does not tax long-held digital currencies, either for capital gains or VAT. However, crypto trades executed within the day are considered similar to day trading in stocks or foreign exchange, attracting tax as business income at the rate of 35%.

Malta is perhaps one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, initiating legislation that has legalized a variety of crypto operations in the country. The government recognizes bitcoin “as a unit of account, medium of exchange, or a store of value.”

Switzerland

In Switzerland, one of Europe’s crypto havens, qualified individuals that buy, sell or hold cryptocurrencies for personal benefit are not required to pay tax on their capital gains. However, income from mining, considered self-employment income, is taxed through income tax. Profitable crypto trading by qualified professionals is subject to corporate tax while wages paid in bitcoin must be declared for income tax purposes.

The company is targeting the users in the United Kingdom and Europe with its debit card and thus will add support for pound and euro.

Along with the two cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Ethereum – Eidoo’s card will allow the storage of fiat funds.

Commenting on the development, Thomas Bertani, CEO of Eidoo, said: “Everyone is anticipating the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, yet there are few solutions which make these digital currencies practical or useful in our daily lives. We know the key is to bring together the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance; the Eidoo Card is that bridge between these two worlds.”

The company told Finance Magnates that support for Visa gateway will be added to its previously added debit card, which is the final milestone of the company’s roadmap.

Bringing the trust of decentralized platforms

Unlike other crypto debit card issuers, Eidoo is following a decentralized approach to gain the trust of its customers. The platform is connecting its cards to its non-custodial Eidoo crypto wallet, giving full control to the users.

The Eidoo Card will also utilize smart contract-based atomic swaps and stablecoins issued by UK financial firm Moneyfold for transaction monitoring.

“There are many crypto cards, but very few DeFi cards. Cards like Monolith and Plutus – the only other truly DeFi, non-custodial cards – are also powered by the VISA network but (as far as I know) are not backed by regulated financial services firms,” Bertani told Finance Magnates.

“Eidoo Card is non-custodial and designed so users maintain full control over their crypto at all times. It’s designed for the DeFi economy and with financial autonomy built-in. We also want to ensure Eidoo Card offers an unparalleled crypto experience, making it even more accessible, enjoyable, and global.”

The company is planning to ship the cards in a phased manner based on the tiers and will start the shipping as early as this summer.

Meanwhile, the demand for crypto debit cards is increasing and many established companies are now offering such services.

Earlier this year, Binance launched its own debit card directly liking its crypto wallet to it. Other exchanges like BTSE also offer such crypto-fiat cards.

South Korean electronics maker Samsung recently partnered with Swipe to add its crypto debit card support on Samsung Pay.

“Our backend uses regulated stablecoins and atomic swaps, an important technical difference. I can’t comment on whether Binance Card will offer the same decentralized approach,” Bertani added.",2020-05-25 13:00:12+00:00

“As on date, no such prohibition exists,” the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on May 22. The statement came in response to a query filed by BV Harish, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

As reported by The Economic Times on Tuesday, the RTI was filed on April 25, seeking clarification on whether banks were still prohibited from providing services to cryptocurrency traders and service providers despite a recent ruling by the Supreme Court to the contrary.

On March 4, India’s Supreme Court quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order dating back to April, 2018, which restricted banks from providing services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.

The RBI had initially planned to file a review petition challenging the Supreme Court’s verdict, as it reportedly believed that trading in virtual currencies would put the country’s banking system at risk. In the end, the central bank did not file the petition, however, neither did it clear the air on crypto trading and taxation. As a result, both banks and the crypto industry have been left in some confusion.

“Since the Supreme Court’s decision, many crypto companies have started resuming their operations by opening up banking channels. However, many banks are still in a dilemma whether to offer their services to crypto companies or individuals since there has been no circular from the RBI ordering the lifting of the ban,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co, told CoinDesk.

Meanwhile, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, said, “while the Supreme Court ruling had made it very clear that there are no curbs on banking for crypto businesses, the RBI reply to [the] RTI filing is very much welcome. There has been confusion amongst many banks despite the Supreme Court ruling because these banks have been waiting for information from RBI.”

CoinDesk reached out to a number of prominent Indian banks in March for information on whether they would allow their customers to use credit or debit cards to fund cryptocurrency purchases. We still haven’t received any reply.

Still, exchanges seem confident that the RBI’s clarification will accelerate the growth of the cryptocurrency space in India. “Hopefully, this response can clear up the confusion for the banks and bring clarity to the crypto community in India, which has shown consistent growth since March,” said Singhal.

Shetty said he expects all banks to start servicing crypto businesses without any restrictions. “This marks yet another positive way forward for the crypto ecosystem in India,” he said.

The Ethereum network now has more bitcoin held in reserves than the Lightning Network, according to onchain statistics. At the time of publication, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has close to 4,000 BTC ($34.7M) held in reserves, while the Lightning Network has only 925 BTC ($8.3M).

Wrapped Bitcoin Project’s Total Value Locked Climbs to 3.9k Bitcoin

Just recently a number of people on Twitter congratulated the Ethereum network for becoming Bitcoin’s (BTC) largest second layer or unofficial side-chain. This is because the Total Value Locked (TVL) for BTC-pegged ETH tokens has surpassed both Lightning Network and Blockstream’s Liquid platform combined. According to statistics on the web portal Defi Pulse, the Lightning Network (LN) has a TVL of around 925 BTC today. This means the LN reserves hold around 0.01% of all BTC in circulation. The TVL on the LN platform has held around $8 to $9 million since May 7, 2020. Prior to that, the LN had about a million dollars less than the current TVL on April 28, 2020.

The BTC-pegged ETH tokens called Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) have seen massive demand lately, and at the moment there is 3.9k BTC held in the WBTC reserves. Using today’s exchange rates there is around $34.7 million worth of BTC held and the demand spiked significantly during the last week and a half. For instance, on May 11, 2020, WBTC’s TVL only held $11 million worth of BTC. After that date, the TVL for the BTC-pegged ETH token jumped significantly and now captures 4X more than the LN platform.

Despite Sidechain Trust Models, Ethereum Is the Largest Bitcoin Sidechain by TVL

In addition to WBTC, the Ethereum network also has a number of other BTC-pegged ETH tokens and the protocol also has more tether (USDT) than the Omni Layer network. Besides tether, a great majority of the crypto economy’s stablecoins like TUSD, USDC, DAI, and PAX all leverage the ETH network as well. Despite, the massive interest in people using ETH for stablecoins and BTC-pegged ETH tokens using the ERC20 standard, Ethereum cofounder has some concerns. On Twitter, someone commented on how there is 2.5X more BTC on Ethereum than Blockstream’s Liquid project. In response, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin said:

I’m worried about the trust models of some of these tokens. It would be sad if there ends up being $5B of BTC on ethereum and the keys are held by a single institution.

Buterin did not disclose which project he was talking about, but many assume he may have been referring to WBTC. The project WBTC does have a custodian, and reserves are kept secure by the company Bitgo. The company offers a transparent web portal that allows people to verify custodied bitcoin addresses against the TVL within WBTC’s coffers. Besides the LN platform taking a fair share of criticism over the years, Blockstream’s Liquid has been criticized by the community as well. The founder of Blockchair, Nikita Zhavoronkov, recently took issue with Blockstream’s Liquid project on May 24 in a tweet.

“Ziya Sadr asks if an Iranian company may become a Liquid Functionary,” Zhavoronkov tweeted. “[Blockstream CEO Adam Back] tries to dodge the question. While the Terms of Service on their website gives a clear answer: NO.”

The discussion concerning Ethereum holding more BTC than the LN and Liquid combined, has been a trending conversation on social media and cryptocurrency forums. Lots of people debating on the custodial reserves held by Bitgo, but people also dislike the 15 company model that holds custodial powers within the Liquid federation. The community may still have to wait for Paul Sztorc’s drivechain, for a more decentralized BTC sidechain or second layer. Despite the custodial controversy, the Ethereum network, as far as Total Value Locked concerned is currently BTC’s largest sidechain and the ETH chain moves an enormous amount of value every day.

The solution consists of a Secure Element (SE) chip S3FV9RR and “enhanced” software. It is designed to secure the booting process, isolated storage and mobile-based payments.

The new SE chip is certified with Common Criteria (CC) EAL 6+ security standard, which is used in applications with the most rigorous security requirements, namely e-passports and cryptocurrency hardware wallets. It can thereby be used in any mobile device, and will work independently from the device's main processor.

Notably, the announcement mentions cryptocurrency transactions as one of the primary purposes of the S3FV9RR chip, which is expected to be available in Q3 2020. Dongho Shin, senior vice president of System LSI marketing at Samsung Electronics, said:

“In this era of mobility and contact-less interactions, we expect our connected devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to be highly secure so as to protect personal data and enable fintech activities such as mobile banking, stock trading and cryptocurrency transactions.”

Samsung’s latest crypto-related developments

Samsung’s interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain is well known, as the corporation has invested in numerous DLT startups, and has integrated the technology in its own products.

Earlier this month, Samsung Pay teamed up with cryptocurrency Visa card platform Swipe, allowing users to make crypto payments with their Samsung Pay-enabled devices.

In February, Samsung presented its latest smartphone series, the Galaxy S20, which reportedly improved on the integrated blockchain security features introduced a year ago on the Galaxy S10.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/swiss-government-rejects-103-million-bailout-for-crypto-companies-battered-by-coronavirus/,"Swiss Government Rejects $103 Million Bailout for Crypto Companies Battered by Coronavirus

Switzerland’s government has rejected a 100 million franc ($103 million) bailout for local cryptocurrency companies battered by the coronavirus economy, local media reported.

Zug finance director Heinz Taennler requested the special funding package in April. He planned to issue out loans to startups, which could be converted into shares.

The central government had already unveiled a $158.6 million credit facility for all fintech startups, but Taennler felt that won’t be enough for the cryptocurrency sector’s ambitious financing needs.

Zug is the heartbeat of Switzerland’s famed crypto industry, commonly known as the “Crypto Valley.”

Now, members of the Zug local government last week turned down Taennler’s funding request, the only such request to be rejected from over 24 different applications for coronavirus emergency funding, according to a report by local newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.

The majority of the government officials were reportedly not too enthused about the future of the crypto industry.

However, the Zug finance director announced a loan facility of about $15.4 million on May 25, which is now expected to provide temporary relief to emerging businesses in Crypto Valley. The report said more than 66% of cryptocurrency and blockchain companies that applied for broader central government loan guarantees failed to get them.

“Taennler wanted to help blockchain start-ups shaken by the corona crisis with a sovereign wealth fund. But his government colleagues reject this,” said the newspaper report.

The once-flourishing Swiss cryptocurrency industry is struggling to survive following the withdrawal of private equity investors.

About 80% of 203 firms surveyed by the Swiss Blockchain Federation recently warned of imminent bankruptcy. Only half of the 50 biggest companies in Crypto Valley expect to last a year in business.

While startups are generally threatened by the Covid-19 impact on the economy, Cypto Valley’s loss of venture capital constitutes an underlying condition.

A mid-2019 analysis of the 50 top companies valued them at $40 billion, which was two times their value at the beginning of the year. The report also listed six unicorns. As a whole, the “Crypto Valley” had more than 800 companies with over 4,000 employees.

Many gold investors are not endorsing Bitcoin as an investment option. Nevertheless, digital asset manager CoinShares launched an index that tracks gold and five crypto assets.

CoinShares’ CGCI is EU BMR Compliant

Earlier on Tuesday, CoinShares launched CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index (CGCI). It is promoted as the first EU Benchmark Regulations (EU BMR) compliant index for the crypto industry that merges gold and crypto assets.

The index can be monitored on Bloomberg Terminals and Refinitiv.

The goal of the new index is to offer exposure to digital assets while boosting average returns and smooth volatility. The CGCI combines the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, the low volatility of the precious metal, and the almost inexistent correlation between the two.

However, during global crises, both gold and Bitcoin might be regarded as reliable safe-havens, which makes a case for a temporary correlation.

Still, the index aims to give institutional investors access to more effective risk control to crypto assets by leveraging the stability of gold. While there are several crypto-oriented indexes that offer exposure to multiple crypto assets via capitalization weighting, most of them cannot boast genuine risk diversification given that there is a high correlation among cryptocurrencies.

As of the beginning of May, crypto assets comprise 31.75% of the CGCI in five equally-weighted components, and gold comprises the remaining 68.25%.

CGCI Might Boost Crypto Adoption Among Institutional Investors

Institutional investors have always been welcomed to the crypto industry, as they have the potential to push the market to new levels. However, Chainalysis found out that whales had driven the Bitcoin crash in mid-March. Thus, there is much room for institutions to come back, especially when COVID-related restrictions are lifted.

CoinShares hopes that its index bodes well for the image of the cryptocurrency market and will bring more professional investors.

The company’s executive chairman, Daniel Masters, commented:

“Robustly researched and documented index products were the catalyst for institutional adoption of commodities in the late ’90’s through the advent of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index. This crypto and gold index aims to do the same, by using academic research and its benchmark regulated status to pass muster with even the most stringent investment committees.”

CoinShares has conducted academic research in collaboration with Imperial College London to figure out how gold and crypto assets would work together in terms of risk distribution.

Professor Will Knottenbelt, who leads the Imperial College Centre’s Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering unit, explained:

“The CGCI is the product of nearly 2 years of research, development and experimentation conducted by Imperial in close collaboration with CoinShares.”

CoinShares is now thinking about turning the index into an investable benchmark as part of its passive products business.

In another update, Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange aggregator CoinDCX raised $2.5 Mn in funding led by existing investor Polychain Capital, alongside San Francisco-based Coinbase Ventures. The company will be using the fund to scale up its tech, business operations and increase crypto adoption in the country.

The percentage of miner revenue from fees has also pulled back to 9.4% from the 28-month high of 21% registered on May 20.

“The fall back in transaction fees are related to a normalized transaction activity and recent mining difficulty adjustment, which occurs around every two weeks,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve.

Users pay fees to miners for processing transactions on the blockchain. Miners also receive a fixed amount of BTC per block mined. That number halves every four years, most recently on May 11 of this year.

Transaction fees are determined by the state of the network (how congested it is) and the size of the transaction.

Bitcoin’s block size is 1 MB, which means miners can process only 1 MB worth of transactions per block mined roughly every 10 minutes. If the number of transactions exceeds 1 MB, the network gets congested and miners prioritize transactions with higher fees.

Source: Bitcoin Visuals

Network congestion, as represented by bitcoin’s memory pool or its collection of unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain, has been on a declining trend since topping out at the 28-month high of 267,608 on May 18 with a total block size of 78.5 MB, as per data source Bitcoin Visuals. As a result, transaction fees have come off highs seen on May 21.

The memory pool exploded at the end of April and remained congested for a few days after halving as the programmed supply cut revved up investor interest, leading to an increase in the number of transactions. “This forced users to increase their mining fee, so they can jump ahead in line to have their transactions confirmed quicker,” said Chen.

Block interval time drops

The recent decline in fees could also be associated with the downward adjustment in the mining difficulty and the resulting drop in block interval time.

The mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to mine blocks, was adjusted lower by 6% to 15.14 terahashes per second on May 20, as the hashrate, or the mining power dedicated to mine blocks fell following the halving.

The seven-day rolling average of bitcoin’s hashrate fell from 120 exahashes per second (EH/s) on May 11 to 90 EH/s to May 23. Moreover, halving doubled the cost of mining, forcing inefficient miners to shut down operations.

When that happens, the time taken to mine blocks and confirm transactions rises, putting upward pressure on prices. Hence, the difficulty is decreased, enticing miners back to the blockchain.

Swiss crypto financial firm Bitcoin Suisse has added gold, silver, and platinum to its platform, allowing users to trade the precious metals against both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), as well as five other major fiat currencies.

The precious metal trades are available for 24/7 trading with immediate cash settlement, the company announced on May 26. The offering is not physically settled, it said, and claims are limited only to crypto and fiat.

Users can invest a minimum of 100 Swiss francs ($103) without custody fees for holdings up to $103,000. Bitcoin Suisse notes that with precious metals, the firm is adding “assets which have been part of long-term investment strategies.”

The three metals can also be traded against the Swiss franc, the United States dollar, the British pound, the euro, and the Danish krone.

“By offering seamless precious metals trading, we go beyond the crypto asset class for the first time,” said Stefan Lütolf, head training, and liquidity management at Bitcoin Suisse.

“It’s an excellent way to move between the two assets with the click of a button,” he added, claiming the new product is in response to rising demand for “scarce, highly valuable assets such as gold and bitcoin.”

Lütolf is not sold to the idea that Bitcoin may be Gold 2.0 just as yet, but the company is preparing for a time when that becomes a reality. The Zug-based firm says “all precious metals on offer are stored by a trusted banking partner. Purchases are backed 100% by the Bitcoin Suisse bank guarantee.”

Bitcoin is increasingly drawing comparisons with gold, an asset so often referred to as the original “safe haven”. Bloomberg recently stated that BTC will mature into a gold-like store of value in 2020, citing coronavirus-induced trillion-dollar stimulus and mainstream adoption as key drivers.

However, tradable products that connect BTC and gold or other precious metals remain few and far between. That is beginning to change, as platforms offering the asset class have started to emerge, including the announcement by peer-to-peer exchange Paxful in April, allowing trades between bitcoin and gold.

The latest Bitcoin analysis from JPMorgan is circulating on Twitter, dated May 22nd. The report from research analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou looks at the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by treating it as a commodity and basing the price on the marginal cost of producing BTC.

According to the report, Bitcoin is trading “25% below what the intrinsic price would be” following the halving event, which reduced block rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

Based on Bitcoin’s price when the report was published, JPMorgan placed BTC’s intrinsic value at $11,593.

JPMorgan has been historically bearish on the top cryptocurrency. Last year, analysts at the investment bank said Bitcoin had topped its intrinsic value after the price rose above marginal cost. Earlier this year, analysts at JPMorgan believed that Bitcoin had some downside risks, as reported by Bloomberg.

In September of 2017, chief executive Jamie Dimon said he would fire any employees who was caught trading BTC because it was both stupid and against the company rules.

JPMorgan’s new report and apparent shift in Bitcoin sentiment comes after the bank onboarded crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as customers, marking a potential end to the bank’s anti-crypto era.

The big takeaway? The stalwart investment bank is still no fan of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

A slideshow released before the call cited hacks and other losses related to cryptocurrencies as well as their use to “abet illicit activities” as some potential liabilities.

Seven of Goldman’s 35 slides mention bitcoin, but the people on the call only discussed bitcoin for roughly five minutes at the end, with no questions taken after.

In the call materials, Goldman notes that while cryptocurrencies like bitcoin “have received enormous attention,” they “are not an asset class.”

Why? The reasons include bitcoin’s inherent lack of cash flow, unlike bonds, and its inability to generate earnings through exposure to global economic growth, according to the presentation. Goldman also notes bitcoin’s volatility, citing the recent drop to 12-month lows in early March. The price spiked nearly 5% to $9,200 a few hours before the call.

Some professional cryptocurrency analysts were less than impressed by Goldman’s analysis. “The criticisms were very cookie cutter, the type you’d expect if someone just read mainstream headlines,” said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari and former investment banking analyst at Moelis & Company. “It’s like they didn’t fully diligence the asset.”

Goldman’s cash flow argument was particularly odd to Tom Masojada, co-founder of OVEX Digital Asset Exchange.

“Many investments that Goldman labels as ‘suitable for clients’ do not generate cash flows and are primarily dependent on whether someone is willing to pay a higher price at a later date,” he said on Twitter.

“One could argue bitcoin isn’t backed by anything, but to liken it to a game of hot potato ignores the subjective value such a novel asset provides,” said Kevin Kelly, former equity analyst at Bloomberg and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm that recently published a comprehensive report on bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s current value, according to Kelly, is backed by “the demand for an apolitical speculative asset that may or may not turn out to be one of the world’s most valuable safe havens.”

The two Goldman speakers on the call, its head of research and a Harvard economics professor, said several bitcoin forks, which they refer to as “nearly identical clones,” occupy three of the six largest cryptocurrencies by market value. With this, Goldman inferred that cryptocurrencies as a whole “are not a scarce resource,” according to the presentation.

This critique is “particularly eye roll worthy,” Watkins told CoinDesk. “Forks are their own assets and have nothing to do with bitcoin.”

In its conclusion, Goldman does not recommend investing in bitcoin “on a strategic or tactical basis for clients’ investment portfolios even though its volatility might lend itself to momentum-oriented traders.”",2020-05-27 18:22:38+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-of-digital-assets-stepping-into-the-world-of-mainstream-crypto,"Over the last decade, we have witnessed the massive development of crypto. Formerly a geeky trend, crypto was once a questionable and not easily understandable invention that was used for pizza payments. Since those early days, cryptocurrencies have been transformed into a store and measure of value for many people.

Those who were at the forefront of the industry profited greatly, and a new wave of millionaires was born, along with new social groups. Crypto anarchists and Bitcoin (BTC) advocates formed an army, and despite the sharp fall during the crypto winter of 2019, we’ve certainly since gained ground.

After the ashes of investor despair, the advent of stable crypto — stablecoins — began. 2017 and 2018 were both “the year of Bitcoin.” 2019 was the year of decentralized finance, and 2020 already looks like the year of the stablecoin. What’s coming next? Let’s try to unravel the future with possible use case predictions.

Exploring digital currency perspectives

1. Personal enrichment

The primary drivers for crypto popularity up to 2017 had been the basic and understandable desire of many to get rich. The ones who bought Bitcoin during the early years made real fortunes; investors who risked and leveraged an opportunity in early initial coin offerings such as Tezos (XTZ), EOS and Ether (ETH) have seen up to 1,400% increases in incomes. Right now, in the wake of the halving that just passed, speculation on prices is still on the rise.

An example is the controversial John McAfee, who predicted a very bold thought about Bitcoin hitting $1 million per coin by the end of the year. McAfee believes that once Bitcoin takes over the global economy, demand will increase and traditional dollars will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, the owner of Snapchat, Jeremy Liew, and Blockchain co-founder Peter Smith predict that the number one crypto asset’s price will reach $500,000 per Bitcoin by 2030.

At the same time, the CEO of Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, examined the year-to-date performance of Bitcoin before the May 12 halving in his letter to investors and predicted that Bitcoin will reach a $100,000 valuation by August 2021.

Then there’s Warren Buffett, who has no intention of spending Berkshire’s $137 billion cash pile, and if stocks plummet, Bitcoin may see another significant correction. Speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett said that $137 billion is not a large cash pile if bad things start to pile up in the market. Berkshire has significant stakes in leading conglomerates such as Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. If the market begins to go in the opposite direction than analysts anticipate, the cash pile can be used to assist Berkshire’s portfolio companies.

2. Reshaped payments

Many people in the world are still not aware of the existence and potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Many regard Bitcoin as being in another bubble. The market capitalization is still not strictly comparable to the asset value of stocks or even the value of tech company Apple. However, major players such as JPMorgan Chase and other banks have already recognized distributed ledger technology as the main driver for system enhancement. There is a lot of ground to cover, as numerous processes strive to reshape this field.

First of all, many companies, thriving businesses and even global brands may start using cryptocurrencies to pay for their services. Doing so will make it possible to remove middlemen from the equation, reducing final costs and securing cheaper, more accessible services for end users.

There are already people who earn income in crypto working in a related field, but mainstream adoption is yet to come. Bitcoin has become a store of value for many people, making it a more convenient investment option than any other, outpacing even gold.

Of course, the digital analogs of United States dollars and euros already serve that role, and with the massive increase in mobile use, estimates suggest that 50% of the world’s population will switch to noncash transactions by the year 2030. In the digital payments segment, the number of users is expected to reach 4.4 billion by the year 2023.

3. Replacement of fiat currencies

Many crypto adopters in traditional venture capital, such as Tim Draper, believe that fiat currencies will disappear over time as more and more people start using various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and others. The primary reason for this adoption is ever more people believing that cryptocurrencies are a reliable store of value across national borders and political systems.

Taking into account the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect an even faster rate of adoption.

Stablecoins represent the latest link of digital asset evolution. Using these assets can be a powerful instrument to ensure stability on volatile cryptocurrency ground. Governments will have more to do with stablecoins than with other crypto assets. Eventually, stablecoins may even replace traditional fiat currency, but that future remains a long way off.

4. Integration with IoT

More than two decades ago, back in 1999, British technologist Kevin Ashton coined the term “Internet of Things” to define a network that connects not only people but also the objects around them. Back in the day, many considered this something worthy of a science fiction film. Today however, IoT is a huge, yet still rapidly growing, network of smart objects that work together in collecting and analyzing data and autonomously performing actions. It has become a reality thanks to the development of incredible wireless communication technologies and data analytics.

By the end of 2019, consumer spending on smart home systems reached more than $100 billion. Spending is expected to continue rising through 2023 to an astonishing level of $157 billion!

From 2015 to 2019, the number of publicly known IoT platforms doubled, reaching 620. Big players such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have also entered the space in an attempt to capture part of the market.

Global spending on IoT is expected to reach $1.1 trillion in 2022, with new technologies such as 5G driving future market growth.

The fusion of two futuristic technologies that are already here seems quite an exciting development. IoT is growing fast, as reported by International Data Corporation, and it is expected that blockchain and IoT technologies will join forces soon.

This integration will set a new standard for scalability and security frameworks for interaction in the IoT devices sector. Moreover, cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins can really provide a decent and efficient way of conducting investments for smart devices.

5. The new age of gaming

Crypto casinos and gaming have already been using crypto for some years now. Quite contrary to regulatory bodies, crypto and blockchain are considered to be a much-needed evolution for gaming concepts, providing numerous benefits. With the esports sector on the rise, more and more companies will ultimately adopt blockchain technologies. The global esports market was valued at nearly $865 million in 2018, and it’s estimated to reach $1.79 billion in 2022.

Esports and gaming usually involve people that are quite advanced in technology, making it a perfect testing ground for the latest developments in the blockchain field.

Over the next few years, different online systems may enjoy DLT-led advancements, as leading video gaming brands have already started work in the field. Epic Games, the studio behind Fortnite, is researching new ways to incorporate blockchain into gaming experiences. While others talk about the future of blockchain, the gaming industry is already living it.

Opening the box of crypto use cases

At the moment, the world is still at the earliest stages of financial technology development, and the forthcoming impact of blockchain on many fields including cloud computing, IoT and artificial intelligence cannot truly be estimated yet, with the potential so rich and vast — and already in development.

Nevertheless, it is exciting to witness new fusions with existing technologies and rollouts of even newer technologies as blockchain opens up ever more options in the future. Taking into regard high demand in both technology use cases and digital assets, blockchain technology is the future. And even though we’ve had over a decade of development, the best is yet to come.

The new network, called RenVM, will start off by connecting Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash to Ethereum. The company says this will be a boost for decentralized finance (DeFi). “By removing liquidity silos that have long hindered DeFi’s growth potential, RenVM will serve as a robust and permissionless tool for all of DeFi to utilize,” it said in a statement.

Essentially, RenVM takes custody of users’ non-Ethereum assets and then mints corresponding ERC-20 tokens for those assets. The first three — called renBTC, renBCH and renZEC — are now live on the Ethereum network.

DeFi projects can use RenVM as a plug-in and add it to their existing smart contracts. This creates an interface on their own applications for users to deposit and withdraw renBTC, renBCH and renZEC. Ren says the protocol differs from similar projects like WBTC and imBTC since it does not rely on a centralized custodian.

In 2018, the project raised 35,000 ether (approximately $30.5 million at the time) in an initial coin offering. Big names including Polychain Capital, FBG and Huobi Capital participated in the round.

In a statement, Ren CTO and co-founder Loong Wang said the team also wants to support other assets, including stablecoins like Libra and China’s digital yuan.",,https://qz.com/india/1853847/indias-wazirx-coinswitch-see-rise-in-cryptocurrency-investors/,"Indian investors are back in the cryptocurrency game and how.

There has been a sharp increase in trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges in India since March 5, when India’s supreme court quashed a Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) circular that barred banks and other financial entities from providing services to virtual currency dealings.

Trading volume on Mumbai-based WazirX, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges, rose 400% and 270% month-on-month in March and April, respectively. Now, the exchange is facilitating around 60 million trades per day as compared to 20 million before March.

WazirX, which was acquired by global exchange Binance in November last year, is also seeing an uptick in new sign-ups and active users, said founder and CEO Nischal Shetty.

For Bengaluru-based global exchange aggregator CoinSwitch, April was the best month since inception in 2017. “Our Indian user base went up by 158% in April,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO of CoinSwitch. “Trading volumes in Indian rupees have shot up to 12-15 million each day from around 5-7 million prior to the supreme court order.” The company, which currently gets around 10% of its users from India, expects this number to rise in the coming months.

Rising like the phoenix

The past two years were a nightmare for crypto exchanges in India. After the RBI’s decision in April 2018, the virtual currency ecosystem in the country nearly choked, leading to several exchanges, including prominent ones like Koinex and Zebpay, shutting shop. A few others shifted outside the country to survive the onslaught.

But those who weathered the storm are now back in full swing. The high demand over the past couple of months has proved that Indians have an appetite for cryptocurrencies, and exchanges are planning to tap the market more efficiently.

For instance, CoinSwitch is creating a tailor-made mobile app called “CoinSwitch Kuber,” which will be exclusive for Indian users. “People can buy and sell over 100 cryptocurrencies easily using Indian rupees. Earlier, users could trade only by using base currencies like Bitcoin,” said Singhal.

Reflecting its commitment to the country, Malta-based global exchange Binance, in tie-up with WazirX, announced on March 17 a $50 million fund to promote the adoption of blockchain technologies in India.

Increased activity in the Indian crypto market has also drawn the attention of global venture capitalists (VCs) who are trying to understand how they can participate in the boom, Shetty of WazirX said. “They have realised that a lot of startups are mushrooming and they want to be the early movers,” he said. “In the US, there are huge investments taking place (in crypto startups) since 2010, which will also happen in India.”

All this attention is great, but experts warn that there are still obstacles for cryptocurrencies in India.

Hurdles Remain

Despite the supreme court’s order, some Indian banks continue to be reluctant to support virtual currencies. “Some banks are co-operating with us, while some are still hesitant,” Singhal of Coinswitch said.

The reason for this resistance could be due to a lack of clear norms from the RBI as well as the anonymous and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. “Banks are concerned about the relative anonymity of cryptocurrencies and how they could be a safe harbour for illicit activities,” Anirudh Rastogi, founder of Ikigai Law, a technology-focused law firm. “By providing services to crypto exchanges and traders, banks think they are opening themselves to a risk of regulatory scrutiny.”

The records of virtual currencies are kept on an open-ledger but the anonymity of owners can create problems. This means cryptocurrencies could be misused to transfer illegal money or evade taxes.

The RBI must intervene to reassure banks and clarify that they can support crypto businesses and trade, he added.

Another hurdle for crypto exchanges to operate smoothly in India is the central government’s hesitancy, including the draft “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill” (2019), which was floated in July 22, 2019 and suggests a ban on all virtual currencies in India.

Until the RBI and the government have a change of heart, the path for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India will remain difficult.",,,,,,,

""I see Bitcoin replacing gold as the hardest money for savers with long time horizons,"" CEO Mike Alfred told Cointelegraph. ""Young people are far more interested in Bitcoin in a world where the economy becomes increasingly online and virtual,"" he added.

Bitcoin has gained significant status since inception

Since its launch over a decade ago, Bitcoin has travelled a price path from less than a dollar, all the way up to nearly $20,000. In that time period, the asset has changed roles several times, from a transactional currency to a financial asset, and everything in between, according to analysis from crypto Twitter analyst PlanB.

""The most compelling use cases continue to be in emerging markets where monetary instability and inflation makes it extremely risky to save in the local currency,"" Alfred said.

Venezuela, for example, was hit hard by inflation in recent years, finding itself drowning in 10,000,000% inflation by the latter half of 2019. Bitcoin, however, found greater popularity in the middle of such cash troubles.

""As Bitcoin becomes more accepted, it will be used in more financial transactions and accepted by an increasing number of tax authorities,"" Alfred posited. ""Eventually Bitcoin could be completely interwoven into the fabric of the global economy.""

Others prefer gold

Not everyone sees Bitcoin in a positive light. Economist and BTC sceptic Peter Schiff has tweeted a number of comments against Bitcoin, preferring gold as an investment.

Bitcoin posted astronomical price gains over the last decade, as crypto space participants often point out. Noting such statistics, Schiff predicted the coming years as gold's time to shine as Bitcoin loses value.

""Over the past several years Bitcoin hodlers poked fun at gold investors because Bitcoin gained so much more than gold,"" Schiff tweeted. ""Over the next several years those roles will reverse, but not because gold rises more than Bitcoin, but because gold moons as Bitcoin crashes back to earth,"" the gold bug added.

Banking giant, Goldman Sachs, also recently said it does not view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset category.

Plenty of crypto industry participants have countered various arguments against BTC over the years, however, including Anthony Pompliano's Bitcoin hedge argument.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/162026-goldman-sachs-bitcoin-btc-and-other-cryptocurrencies-are-not-an-appropriate-asset-class/,"Research analysts at NYSE: GS ), a New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company with around $1 trillion in assets, is still not convinced that Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies would be a worthwhile investment for its clients.

The Wall Street investment bank has argued that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may not be considered a viable investment vehicle, given the current economic uncertainty created by the global COVID-19 outbreak.

Goldman Sachs analysts stated:

“Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are not appropriate as an asset class.”

The research team at the bank was critical of the highly volatile nature of BTC and other crypto assets. The giant banking institution also pointed out that digital currencies exhibited unstable correlations with other major asset classes. Goldman also claims there’s generally a lack of evidence that Bitcoin can serve as an effective hedge against inflation.

The institution further noted:

“We believe that a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients.”

Goldman Sachs’ recent call acknowledged that certain hedge funds were trading BTC, because of its high levels of volatility. However, the bank’s investment team said it would not recommend the cryptocurrency as a reliable asset to its clients.

Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the CIO for wealth management at Goldman Sachs, remarked:

“We also believe that while hedge funds may find trading cryptocurrencies appealing because of their high volatility, that allure does not constitute a viable investment rationale.”

The institution’s event was hosted by its investment strategy team, which operates under Goldman’s wealth management arm.

Multi-billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones recently advised that a 1-2% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin (BTC) would be reasonable for most investors.

However, Goldman Sachs confirmed:

“We do not recommend Bitcoin on a strategic or tactical basis for clients’ investment portfolios even though its volatility might lend itself to momentum-oriented traders.”

The bank’s views appear to be consistent with its statements issued in 2018:

“Our view that cryptocurrencies would not retain value … remains intact and, in fact, has borne out much sooner than we expected.”",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-goldman-lists-reasons-why-not-asset-class-suitable-investment-2020-5-1029248469,"Reuters / Dado Ruvic

Goldman Sachs gave five reasons why it thinks bitcoin is ""not an asset class"" nor ""a suitable investment"" in a presentation Wednesday morning.

Goldman observed that the cryptocurrency infrastructure is still young and susceptible to hacking or inadvertent loss, and that it is primarily used as a conduit for illicit activity.

The bank said that it believes a security ""whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment.""

Goldman noted that the crypto bubble dwarfs all other bubbles, including historic manias like the tulip and dot-com bubbles.

Goldman Sachs, led by Jason Furman and Jan Hatzius, said in a presentation on Wednesday that bitcoin ""is not an asset class,"" nor is it ""a suitable investment.""

The bank gave five reasons why investors should shy away from the cryptocurrency:

1. Bitcoin does not generate cash flow like bonds.

2. Bitcoin does not generate any earnings through exposure to global economic growth.

3. Bitcoin does not provide consistent diversification benefits given its unstable correlations.

4. Bitcoin does not dampen volatility given historical volatility of 76%. Goldman points to March 12 when bitcoin fell 37% in a single day as evidence that bitcoin's volatility is through the roof.

5. Bitcoin does not show evidence of hedging against inflation.

Goldman said that ""a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment...""

Additionally, although hedge funds may find trading cryptocurrencies appealing because of their high volatility, that alone does not constitute a viable investment rationale, the bank said.

Paul Tudor Jones is the latest hedge fund manager to add bitcoin to his portfolio.

Bitcoin bulls often point to the fact that bitcoin is scarce, as in, like gold, there is a limited supply of it (21 million coins once all of them are mined).

But Goldman countered the scarcity argument by pointing out that cryptocurrencies as a whole are not a scarce resource.

There are several thousand cryptocurrencies, with a combined market cap of around $250 billion. And three of the largest six cryptocurrencies are forks, or nearly identical clones - bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin SV according to Goldman.

Other issues with bitcoin include that it's primarily used as a conduit for illicit activity. It's been used in ransomware attacks, money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and dark net market places for illicit goods.

On top of that, the infrastructure of cryptocurrency is still relatively young and is susceptible to hacking or inadvertent losses, Goldman said.

Lastly, Goldman said that cryptocurrency was the biggest bubble or mania ever. The meteoric rise of bitcoin and ether, another cryptocurrency, in late 2017 dwarfs that of the tulip bubble in the 1630s and the dot-com tech bubble of 2000.

Goldman Sachs

Whereas tulip prices rocketed 485% in the year before reaching its peak, bitcoin jumped 2,292% and ether jumped 14,193% in the years running up to their respective peaks.

Technically, bitcoin is struggling with the $10,000 resistance level, and what it does at this make-or-break level could determine where bitcoin goes next.

The one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, is currently at 6.6%, down from its multi-month high of 22% on May 22, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

The metric fell sharply from 15% to 5% on Wednesday as prices rose from $9,000. This confirms a bullish breakout on technical charts. Essentially, the demand for put options, or bearish bets, has dropped as prices rise.

“The decline in skew is related to higher perceived halving risk since mid-May, causing elevated skews,” said Luuk Strijers, COO at cryptocurrency derivative exchange Deribit. “Now the market seems to be less worried about further downward moves reducing the demand for puts.”

Put options drew greater demand after the May 11 reward halving, pushing the one-month skew higher to 20% from 12%. This was possibly due to fears that the cryptocurrency would witness a price pullback similar to the 30% decline seen in the four weeks following the second halving, which took place on July 9, 2016.

A 9% correction happened last week with prices falling from $9,950 to $8,660. The cryptocurrency defended levels below $8,700 multiple times earlier this week before jumping back above $9,000.

Dip demand

As bitcoin fell from $10,000 to $8,630 in the seven days to May 25, the number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC rose from five-year lows, according to data provided by Glassnode.

“Once again, the big players seem to be accumulating into the dip,” analysts at blockchain intelligence firm Santiment noted in a blogpost.

The number of addresses rose from 16,010 to 16,089 during the price decline, a sign of dip demand and investor belief in the long-term bullish story, The number of addresses holding at least 0.01 BTC and 0.1 BTC also reached record highs during the recent price drop.

Technical charts now indicate a scope for a rally toward resistances lined up near $9,850 and $10,000.

4-hour and daily charts

Bitcoin has invalidated the bearish lower highs pattern on the four-hour chart with a convincing move above $9,310 (horizontal line). With that, the positive view put forward by Wednesday’s falling wedge breakout has gained credence.

The cryptocurrency could rise further to resistance located at $9,875, the upper end of the narrowing price range seen on the daily chart. A close above that level would signal a resumption of the rally from the low of $3,867 observed in March.",2020-05-28 14:36:54+00:00,https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/28/africas-drive-cryptocurrency-adoption/,"In response to the global challenges in various financial markets, recent trends suggest that Africa’s youth is leaning towards cryptocurrency as an alternative. Despite the obvious attraction, a number of questions persist on how cryptocurrency will shape the future of finance.

A study conducted by Arcane Crypto — a Norway-based crypto researcher — in collaboration with Luno, a leading crypto exchange provider, maintains that Africa is ideal for rapid crypto adoption due to current high inflation rates, volatile currencies, and a dearth of banking infrastructure, as well as a young digital-driven population.

According to CoinMarketCap’s Q1 2020 report on cryptocurrency adoption, Africa had the second-highest adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide. The continent had a percentage youth growth of 91.47%, owing much to Nigeria’s 210.6% growth in young crypto users.

At 210.6%, Nigerian youth led the rest of the world in percentage growth of cryptocurrency adoption, far ahead of Australia (+158.07%), Spain (+120.71%), Canada (+112.45%), and Mexico (+97.33%) that make up the top five.

These numbers might seem impressive considering that the global crypto market was not spared from the pandemic in Q1 2020 when its market cap fell by 57% to $150 billion in March 2020.

However, as shown by Arcane’s research, African countries lag behind others in infrastructure that will support the use of cryptocurrency. There is no meaningful mining activity, and it still has the lowest number of merchants that accept cryptos as a means of payments.

Africa also has relatively low numbers for non-P2P trading but has a higher focus on P2P trading. This means the main drive for most African users is buying cryptos when they are cheap and selling to others for a profit.

While cryptos are neither legal nor illegal, Arcane believes the hesitance of most African governments to take a stance is linked to the low adoption levels. It would then seem that several Africans are still not sure what to make of this currency.

“Cryptocurrencies are the talk of the Internet these days, but you don’t see where to spend them when purchasing an item because they’re not yet legal. Our best option is to buy them, sell, and make money,” says Kevin* a crypto trader in Nigeria.

According to Kevin, without this option, several Nigerian youth will not see the value of cryptos or take it seriously as a possible currency for the future.

A closer look at cryptocurrency

Arcane reports that the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies is being fueled by the volatility of traditional currencies, an unstable political and economic terrain, and a large population that is underserved by banking services.

However, the cryptocurrency market is also subject to volatility which constantly shoots the price up or crashes it within a short time. Between January and May, Bitcoin has gone as high $10,000 and as low as $3,900. A difference of $6,100.

While this might be linked to the pandemic, that has always been the case for most cryptocurrencies. From December 17, 2017, to that same date in 2018, Bitcoin fell in value from $19,870 to $3,391.

An analysis by Investopedia reveals that just like the regular stock market, market forces still affect the price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

News reports speculating that Bitcoin is about to be regulated, experts speculating the directions the price will go in, or just plain bad news regarding the sector has greatly caused a lot of volatility.

When the values of normal currencies are about to drop, governments can intervene to limit the impact, but as an unregulated market, the fluctuations are uncontrollable and subject to the activities of big influencers of the market.

What then is responsible for this growing adoption?

For Kevin, Bitcoins represent another means to make money, but no one is certain as to what the future holds for it.

“I started trading Bitcoins in 2015, and then you would hear things like ‘Bitcoin was just $2 in 2011, if you had bought it then, you will have $504 now.’ Today, at roughly $9,000, the same message is still being preached,” he recounts.

Rather than let their money sit in the bank where it will accumulate charges, Kevin insists most youth would prefer to brave the uncertain waters of Bitcoin like they do in the forex market or with US stocks.

Why crypto might turn out to be something different than you think

No one holds a patent for cryptocurrencies, so anyone can create them. While the market is uncertain for unregulated digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, recent trends are showing that world governments and the corporate world are not entirely averse to cryptocurrencies.

In a rumour that was later denied, with the country stating it remains open to experiments, Tunisia was said to have issued a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Senegal has piloted an eCFA, while Ghana and Rwanda are exploring the development of their own CBDCs.

Companies like Facebook, IBM, and JPMorgan Chase are developing their own internal cryptocurrencies.

While Arcane believes that this might influence the adoption of cryptos, the creation of digital currencies by governments or corporations might change how it is used and monitored.

Cryptos developed by juggernauts like JPMorgan Chase will only be used internally within the company and will be tightly controlled and closely monitored.

Kevin believes that once governments start creating their own cryptos, they will be eerily similar to fiat money since they will be regulated and protected against the fluctuations normally seen in the unregulated and decentralised crypto market.

During the month of April, the blockchain project Onfo initiated an experiment to see how fast crypto assets can gain popularity in four different countries. The team’s findings discovered that cryptocurrencies spread four times faster in developing nations as opposed to developed countries.

Crypto Asset Network Effect Grows Stronger in Undeveloped Countries

Last month, the blockchain team from the project Onfo, decided to run a social mining experiment in a number of different countries to see how crypto assets gain recognition and popularity. The researchers chose four different countries which include the U.S., Germany, Indonesia, and Russia. The U.S. and Germany represented the developed countries, while Russia and Indonesia are developing nations. Free crypto assets were sent to 100 individuals from each country and every person got ten coins each.

The individuals would also get more coins if they attracted other users to try the crypto asset and results had shown the spread was far larger in developing countries. According to the results, the network effect spread was four times faster in Russia and Indonesia than it was in the U.S. and Germany. Onfo detailed that in the United States, 100 people attracted 1,112 people. In Germany the 100 individuals told 763 new people and the 100 Russian participants attracted 2,304 new users. Indonesia’s spread rates were monumental, as the 100 Indoneisan users attracted a whopping 4,350 people.

“The spread index turned out to be almost 4 times higher than in the US, given that the two countries have similar population sizes,” explains Onfo’s report.

The founder of Onfo, J.R. Forsyth, believes the spread was faster in developing countries because small amounts of money are valued more in these regions. Forsyth noted that Indonesia shows an opportunity for “massive growth” and there are various factors that bolster the spread. “The absence of a national credit lending system, coupled with increasing smartphone penetration and the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, are also making Indonesia a ripe market for cryptocurrency disruption,” the report highlights.

“Indonesia possesses the unique conditions that make it well-poised for Bitcoin adoption. As the world’s fourth most populous country, it’s home to a largely cash-based community, and huge swaths of the population — up to 80% — remain unbanked,” Forsyth stressed in the report.

Southeast Asia and South Africa Are Ripe for Blockchain Growth and a Crypto Renaissance

The U.S. and Indonesia have close to the same population, and Onfo’s findings show 14% of the American population are cryptocurrency users. In Indonesia, with around 270 million residents, the number of crypto users is around 11%.

“In-depth analysis of the statistical data shows that Indonesians started getting involved in the crypto market 1-2 years ago, while Americans delved into the industry in 2008-2010. The results of the experiment conducted by Onfo demonstrate a rapidly expanding adoption level in Indonesia, meaning that the country can soon face its crypto renaissance,” the report details.

The report’s authors also note that Southeast Asia is ripe for crypto asset adoption, and there are also other developing nations that are seeing the beginnings of a “crypto renaissance.” For instance, the Onfo report shows that South Africa is currently experiencing the renaissance period and reports from Luno and Arcane Research highlight these findings.

“South Africa has the highest percent of cryptocurrency ownership or use among internet users in Africa, standing at 13%, followed by Nigeria with 11%,” Onfo’s report concludes. “The increase in volumes of cryptocurrencies across the continent has also seen P2P volumes from Sub-Saharan Africa overtake Latin America for the first time.”

The whale’s Bitcoin wallet just received 6,000 BTC worth $56 million. As noted by a prominent crypto analyst who goes by the name Capo, the wallet has received large amounts of BTC right before major market pullbacks at least six times in the past.

“These are the times that the BTC wallet (3PzdbAwvDJ1MiE87J468MQHtK1CjBbhi8y) received supply. Last time was today. Draw your own conclusions.”

“He receives BTC, he sells BTC. [There’s a] correlation between incoming transfers and price. I don’t think it’s an exchange. Exchange wallets have many more transfers.”

The research, which has not yet been subjected to peer review, focused on several Ethereum-specific features that overall make the network easier to track than competitors like Bitcoin (BTC).

The researchers noted that Ethereum’s account model, contrasted with Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, already makes it less private due to the practice of wallet reuse:

“The account-based model reinforces address-reuse on the protocol level. This behavior practically makes the account-based cryptocurrencies inferior to UTXO-based currencies from a privacy point of view.”

The Ethereum name service

A unique feature of Ethereum is its name service, which ties addresses to human-readable “.eth” domains. The researchers were able to scrape 890 domains located on public Twitter profiles.

This was already enough to discover potentially compromising activity, as about 10% of those wallets interacted with gambling platforms, while 5% used adult services.

The researchers then used the ENS addresses as starting points to discover if they could tie other addresses to the person’s public identifier.

They proposed several methods to identify specific account owners across multiple addresses, which include time zone signatures, gas prices and shared activity among multiple addresses.

De-anonymizing mixer services

The methods were applied to a well-known trustless mixer, Tornado Cash, which lets users “clean” their funds by sending them to a fresh address.

However, researchers found out that 7.5% of them withdrew their money to the exact same account that made the deposit, which rendered their mixing efforts completely futile.

Using custom gas values across multiple transactions and making direct transfers between the deposit and withdrawal wallets also makes identification easy. Overall, up to 17% of transactions can be de-anonymized through these simple techniques.

Furthermore, the majority of these linked users do not hold their funds in the contract for more than a few days, which can be used to reduce the overall anonymity set. Many will also use the same wallets to receive multiple 0.1 ETH withdrawals, which makes it easy to compare them with incoming wallet transactions.

While the researchers focused on Ethereum’s weaknesses, they cautioned that the same techniques could also be used on UTXO-based currencies — just not as easily. They concluded:",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/maicapital-launches-bitcoin-based-quant-fund/,"SFC-licensed blockchain and crypto-related asset manager, MaiCapital announced this week the launch of its second crypto-themed quantitative hedge fund, Bitcoin+ Investment Fund1, which aims to track and potentially outperform Bitcoin’s performance in various market conditions.

Russian lawmakers introduced a set of draft bills regulating digital assets earlier this month, which would effectively ban any transactions using crypto within the country’s borders. In response, the crypto community has filed a number of protest letters.

If the proposed regulation is passed, the Russian economy could lose up to $10 billion in taxes annually, which the crypto industry would otherwise be able to pay if it could operate legally, says a letter by crypto lobbying group RAKIB to the bills’ sponsor, Anatoly Aksakov. A copy of the letter was also sent to Maxim Reshetnikov, head of the Ministry of Economic Development.

Aksakov, a member of the Russian parliament (the State Duma), previously told news agency Interfax that Russians would be able to purchase cryptocurrencies on exchanges registered abroad but not in Russia, and they will have to report their crypto for tax purposes at home.

RAKIB’s letter says one of the bills introduced prohibits the issuance of cryptocurrencies using servers located in Russia and web domains registered in the country, which means local crypto businesses will have to leave for other jurisdictions.

In addition, Russia will lose the opportunity to maintain technological leadership and “build a new Iron Curtain” cutting it off from the global tech infrastructure and force young tech talent to work abroad.

The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an advocacy group for companies in various industries in Russia, sent its own letter to the parliament. This letter was referenced in the Telegram channel of Elina Sidorenko, the head of the Working Group on Estimated Risk of Cryptocurrency Turnover in the Duma.

The letter points out the ban on any economic activities with crypto contradicts Russia’s policy on the digitization of the economy, which was announced by President Vladimir Putin in 2017. Plus, the suggested regulation “contradicts the main international rules for regulating the digital assets,” the letter says.

The Duma’s own expert council for digital economy and blockchain, in turn, sent a letter to Putin’s counsel for protecting the rights of entrepreneurs, Boris Titov. The group warned the new regulation would endanger the constitutional rights of Russians and provoke abuse of power by law enforcement agencies. This letter has been also shared by Sidorenko.

The draconian sanctions for merely facilitating crypto transactions and providing information about them, including in the mass media, will freeze digital economy growth in Russia and scare away potential foreign investors, this letter says.

“In the crisis time in particular, such measures are inappropriate,” the document reads.

Another crypto advocacy group, the International Digital Economy Organization, sent a letter to the parliament suggesting that instead of a ban, crypto-related enterprises should be recognized as a legitimate kind of business and the government should only ban transactions related to money laundering and the financing of crimes, with the threshold for suspicious transactions above 200 million rubles (about $283,000). Mining and exchanging crypto for fiat should be taxed at a 4% rate, the letter says.

Sidorenko believes the reactions reflect thinking in the industry at the moment the proposed regulation is not yet ready to be adopted. One of the issues with the draft package is the ban on crypto has been introduced to the parliament as an addition to an earlier bill on digital securities, which has already passed through a first hearing in Duma.

This means all the new bills will go straight to a second hearing, speeding up the legislative process. If the lawmakers agree with the feedback provided by the Russian crypto community, they will have to push the entire legislative package back a step to a first hearing, Sidorenko said. In that event, the new regulation would not be considered before autumn because the Duma is about to break for the summer.

Markets look to have become cautious ahead of President Trump’s response to China’s decision to implement a national security law in Hong Kong, putting the jurisdiction’s autonomy in doubt.

“We’ll be announcing what we’re doing tomorrow (Friday) with respect to China. And we are not happy with China. We are not happy with what’s happened,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. Trump warned earlier this week it would impose sanctions on China if the law is introduced.

The expectation is Trump will announce some symbolic sanctions against individuals and companies. That said, with the presidential elections due in November, a bigger action cannot be ruled out. The resulting geopolitical tensions could bode well for bitcoin as many analysts and investors consider it a safe haven asset.

“I expect serious anti-Chinese rhetoric in the coming days/weeks/months as Trump tries to use nationalism/protectionism and anger towards China/COVID as a major catalyst for support,” Phillip Gillespie, CEO of B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk in an email. “I am personally bullish [on bitcoin] due to a combination of excess stimulus from all the major central banks (ample liquidity in the system) and pick-up in geopolitical risks.”

Meanwhile, analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, believe the geopolitical tensions have created a “perfect storm” for the cryptocurrency.

In fact, they suggested in a weekly report on Thursday that the cryptocurrency’s week-to-date gains are the result of increased haven demand fueled by the U.S.-China tensions and the slide in the yuan.

“Previously back in 2019, similar fears have driven Chinese investors to move their onshore RMB (China’s yuan) out of the country, where speculators reckon a part of that has trickled into Bitcoin given the increased demand over the same period,” according to the report. “We are observing similar price action currently as Bitcoin has rallied 6.2% since, from $8,700 to $9,250 level, once again breaking out from its 2019-2020 daily trendline.“

It remains to be seen if the geopolitical tensions escalate and lead increased haven flows into bitcoin. The cryptocurrency did rise by over 30% in the first half of January when Iran and the U.S. conducted airstrikes on their respective bases in Iraq, injecting geopolitical uncertainty into the financial markets.

Some might argue that bitcoin failed to perform as a haven asset during the height of the coronavirus crisis in March. While that is true, almost every asset, including classic safe haven asset gold, took a beating back then as investors fled for cash.

Aside from President Trump’s China speech, bitcoin analysts are also keeping an eye on the May expiry of cash-settled futures and options contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

“23k bitcoin equivalent futures and 10k bitcoin options are set to expire this Friday on CME. Approx 50% of open interest for each product,” crypto derivatives research firm Skew tweeted earlier this week.

Price volatility tends to pick up around the time of expiry of futures and options activity due to increased trading activity.

However, CME’s contribution to total futures open interest listed across the globe is only 11%, according to Skew data. Similarly, the Chicago exchange’s contribution to total options open interest is also quite low, so the expiry – due Friday at 15:00 UTC – may not have a major influence on prices.",2020-05-29 12:17:15+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-and-ethereum-price-surge-alongside-bitcoin-will-xlm-follow,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a defined range over the past weeks as the halving hype has passed. Bitcoin’s price action also led to increased volatility in altcoins and some of the smaller altcoins have been showing impressive strength. So far, Theta Token (THETA) and Band Protocol (BAND) have been heavy movers.

However, in the previous days, the larger cap altcoins have started to move up, with Cardano (ADA) and Ether (ETH) as the primary movers. As Bitcoin attempts to find a way back to $10,000, traders will closely watch to see if there is more to follow from these large cap altcoins.

The daily chart is showing an evident compression between $195 and $215, which finally broke to the upside. Alongside that, the chart is also showing some critical metrics for further upward momentum.

Key indicators for bull or bear markets are the support above or below the 100-day and 200-day moving average. As long as the price of a certain asset continues to move above the moving averages the asset is in bull territory.

Why is that important? Throughout the entire previous bull cycle, the price of Ethereum remained above these indicators, leading to a peak of $1,400 in January 2018.

Notably, the volume is also massively increasing in recent periods, showing signs of accumulation as volume precedes price. A similar sign is shown on the altcoin market capitalization chart.

Altcoin market capitalization prepares to shift toward $110-$140 billion

Altcoin market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

The total market capitalization for altcoins is showing an impressive increase in volume, while the capitalization is also flipping the 100-day and 200-day MA for support.

As the chart is showing, the support is found at these MAs in which $68-$72 billion is an essential support.

Furthermore, the resistance is established at $113 and $136 billion. This is a vital resistance as the $113 billion level can be compared with the $6,000 floor of Bitcoin in 2018. The price of Bitcoin is now far above the $6,000 barrier, as it’s currently hovering between $9,100 and $10,000.

Therefore, it’s time for altcoins to start pacing up, and the next resistance levels are found at the $113 and $136 billion level. If the total market capitalization rallies towards the $136 billion level, that would mean a surge of 60% for the entire altcoin market capitalization.

What’s happening with Cardano?

ADA USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

The strongest large-cap altcoin in the past week has been Cardano which has moved 30% in recent days. This last push made the cryptocurrency rally towards the levels from February 2020, through which all the losses of the March 12 market crash have vanished.

What’s behind this push? From a fundamental perspective, a new roadmap for the release of Shelley is complete, triggering a further rally on the price.

However, on the technical side, the price has been holding the 100-day and 200-day MA as support earlier. After that, the green area around $0.05 became support, which fueled the continuation of the upwards momentum.

Right now, the next resistance of this pair is found at $0.07, with a potentially exciting support level at $0.057-$0.06.

If the $0.057-$0.06 confirms as support, a potential continuation rally towards $0.07 and $0.09 as the next targets are on the tables.

Confluent with previous statements, Cardano’s trading volume is also increasing this week. A possible explanation is that investors are jumping from Bitcoin towards altcoins as various projects are finally starting to release their products and platforms.

Will Stellar Lumens follow Cardano?

XLM USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

Meanwhile, other large-caps are starting to show signals of potential upwards continuation as well. Cardano has been rallying in the previous days, Ether broke through $213-$215 as a key resistance level. Stellar Lumens (XLM) is also showing signals of potential continuation as well.

The green zone at $0.06-$0.0625 has to remain a support, but overall the structure is beginning to form a bullish pennant. This is due to the fact the price of Stellar Lumens continues to make higher lows, leading to a potential continuation to the upside.

The next primary target for Stellar Lumens is the resistance at $0.085-$0.087.

What to expect from the ADA/BTC and ETH/BTC

The ETH/BTC pair has been trading inside a range structure since the August-September of 2019. However, since it’s low in September 2019, the price has been making structural higher lows.

ETH BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

Through that, the trend for ETH/BTC can be classified as an uptrend. What are the next significant hurdles for Ether?

First of all, a breakthrough above the 0.024 sats level should be beneficial for continuation. The 0.024 sats level is confluent with the 200-day MA and needs to be broken for a sustainable extension. As discussed, finding support above the 200-day MA is a vital indicator for further bullish momentum.

Once the price of Ether is above the resistance level (whether or not a retest of the 0.021 sats level occurs), a new higher high should be made.

By creating a new higher high, the price of Ether will finally break out of this range. If the 0.027 sats level is broken to the upside, the next target lies at 0.034 sats.

Where Ether is still fighting the moving averages, is ADA/BTC is already leading the pack and acting above them.

ADA BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

The Cardano chart in the BTC pair is showing an apparent breakthrough in the resistance at 0.00000625 sats, after which the price rallied towards the next resistance at 0.00000680-0.00000700 sats.

This is the last hurdle before a further surge. Preferably, the price should come down for a retest of the 0.00000625-0.00000640 sats level for support.

However, once the price of ADA/BTC breaks through the 0.00000690 sats level, a further, mpre sustainable rally towards 0.00001000 - 0.00001070 sats level is on the table. Such a rally would mean a new surge of 60%-70%.

Key Takeaways Derivatives have seen an insurgence in liquidity over the last year, giving the instruments an important role in analyzing BTC and ETH price action.

Spot markets are still the dominant force, and most trend reversals are preceded by a change in capital inflow to exchanges.

The rally between December 2019 and February 2020 was the first derivative-induced price movement.

Using data from both markets to draw actionable insights will offer a clearer picture than just looking at either one exclusively.

Share this article

Analysts cannot evaluate Bitcoin like a stock, so sentiment plays an essential role in determining price trends. A sure shot way to improve one’s market analysis is to look at both the spot and derivative markets simultaneously.

The Rise of Crypto Derivatives

Bitcoin’s liquidity is predominantly derived from the spot market. This means most activity related to the cryptocurrency is the exchange of coins on exchanges like Binance or OTC desks like Cumberland.

Crypto derivatives, however, have been one of the leading growth stories of the last two years. In just a year, BTC and ETH derivatives have seen immense growth in liquidity and trading volumes.

A clear cut sign of this is BitMEX, which was previously unchallenged, losing market share to competitors as they battle for derivatives market share.

This growth stems from the arrival of hedge funds and large traders to the crypto market. Derivatives offer an efficient way for traders to increase or limit their exposure to an asset. As a result, derivatives are the preferred instrument of those who trade large sums.

In 2020, Bitcoin options have witnessed vigorous growth. However, the size of the options market is considerably smaller than futures.

Hence, the prime focus of derivatives analysis rests in the futures market.

This is important because retail investors tend to shun derivatives activity when examining sentiment. Over the last year, the liquidity from derivative markets has started to manifest into price discovery for BTC and ETH.

Using data to gauge investor sentiment in the spot and derivatives markets are two sides of the same coin.

Predicting Bitcoin’s Trend With Spot Metrics

In hindsight, the 2017 top was imminent. The sheer amount of BTC flowing into exchanges during December 2017 and January 2018 was staggering.

Over 250,000 BTC was deposited in a single day in January 2018. Considering the average deposit was roughly 50,000 BTC per day, this was an extremely bearish sign.

Many missed this point due to bull market euphoria and a lack of accessible data at the time.

In general, a rising number of BTC deposits on exchanges is a pessimistic sign, as it signals investors intend to sell soon. Conversely, withdrawals, a proxy for buyers, also rise as they attempt to buy the sell orders on an exchange.

A lesser amount of BTC is withdrawn, however, which indicates that buyers are unable to soak up all the incoming supply from sellers.

It’s important to note that when analyzing sentiment, deposits tend to have precedence over withdrawals. This means when deposits for a particular day are higher than the average, it is a bearish signal even if withdrawals are up by a similar amount.

Fast forward to January 2019: BTC finally bottomed after a painful end to 2018. But as its price started to rebound, BTC finally began to leave exchanges after over a year.

In May 2019, BTC began flowing back to exchanges. This meant that investors who bought the dip earlier in the year started to take profits.

Alas, a little over a month later, BTC’s price topped, but the amount of BTC held on exchanges continued to rise. In what we now know was a sign of continuation in bearish sentiment, the top in June 2019 was the start of a six-month downtrend.

All of this was made clear to those who were looking at spot market data.

Futures Market Kicks In

Derivatives influence price discovery in traditional markets like stocks, gold, and bonds as liquidity tends to be higher than their corresponding spot markets.

However, since only BTC and ETH futures/options are liquid, they are the only two cryptocurrencies where derivatives have a meaningful effect.

Between June 2019 and December 2019, BTC made a series of lower highs and lower lows, which was confirmation that sellers were in control of the market.

This almost changed in February 2020 as BTC made a run for $10,500. During this rally, there was continuous selling pressure in the spot market. Futures, on the other hand, were going wild with bullish sentiment.

From the bottom in December to the top in February, BTC rallied around 65%, and open interest for futures increased by 210%. This was the first significant rally where sentiment from derivatives was able to get the better of the spot market.

Even the latest sell-off in BTC seems to be driven by derivatives, but it is too early to confirm this. BTC has lost roughly 12% since it crossed the $10,000 threshold two weeks ago. But BTC deposits and balance on exchanges continue to dwindle.

At the same time, open interest on BitMEX measured in BTC has increased, indicating that more contracts are being opened as BitMEX only accepts deposits in BTC.

Using Information to Your Advantage

An individual who was only watching the Bitcoin futures market would have missed most of the signs that the short-term trend for BTC was reversing. But if they were watching the spot markets, they would have seen the signs for most rallies but missed others.

While the latter seems like a favorable scenario, keeping tabs on both markets would result in a much higher hit rate for investors.

The emergence of derivatives as a way to trade BTC should not be ignored. These instruments are essential to price discovery, and this phenomenon will only get stronger as BTC futures and options grow.

China has passed the country’s long-awaited civil code which expands the scope of inheritance rights to include cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin. Inherited cryptocurrencies will be protected under the new law. Meanwhile, several Chinese courts have recently ruled that bitcoin and ethereum are properties protected by law.

Inherited Cryptocurrencies Protected by Law

The third session of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s top legislature, voted on and passed the “Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China” on Thursday. In addition to general and supplementary provisions, the civil code ”includes six parts on real rights, contracts, personality rights, marriage and family, inheritance, and tort liabilities,” Xinhua News Agency reported.

Noting that the decision to draft a civil code was announced in October 2014 and the legislative process started in June 2016, the news outlet detailed:

[The new civil code] states that the property rights of individuals are equally safeguarded to those of the State and collective, and online virtual assets are protected, too.

Wang Chen, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, told the session that “The compilation of the civil code is an important component of the plans of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core for developing the rule of law,” the publication conveyed. This new civil code will enter into force on Jan. 1, 2021.

The scope of inheritance has been expanded from the existing law. Under the new civil code, “virtual assets, such as bitcoins, [can] be inherited,” as are all property legally acquired by a natural person, the news outlet emphasized.

Wang Liming, executive vice president of the Renmin University of China and a law professor, was quoted as saying: “The civil code is the first law to carry the title ‘code’ for the People’s Republic of China. It lays down the fundamental principles and regulations regarding civil activities and relations. It reflects the will of the people and protects their rights and interests.”

Several Chinese courts have also ruled that cryptocurrencies are property that should be protected by law. For example, the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People’s Court ruled that bitcoin is an asset protected by law while the Shenzhen Futian District People’s Court ruled that ethereum is legal property with economic value.

Meanwhile, China is working on issuing its own central bank digital currency but there is currently no timetable for the launch, Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), told reporters this week. Internal pilot tests have been conducted in various cities “to check the theoretical reliability, system stability, conveniency, applicability and risk controllability of the digital currency,” the governor confirmed.

The price ends the week down but a late rally has pushed it back over $9,000. Technical analysts expect Bitcoin to continue rising based on the liquidation range of short positions, a discussion of cryptocurrency in Goldman Sachs’s client call, and a lack of funding in the futures market. On the other hand, if ratings agency Weiss is right, more than 21 million Bitcoins may now be in circulation. The agency, known for controversial opinions, blames leverage in agencies.

The entry of Google into the blockchain space might help soak up some that extra supply though, if it exists. Blockchain company Theta Labs has partnered with Google Cloud to let users deploy and run nodes. Google Cloud will also act as a validator serving Europe. On the other hand, Google’s Chrome is facing strong competition from crypto-powered Brave. The browser now offers video calls, even as the Telegram messaging service seals its departure from the Telegram Open Network. TON will now stand for “The Open Network.”

While Google prepares to validate, other Bitcoin owners have been in-validating. They’ve used 145 addresses to call Satoshi pretender Craig Wright “a liar and a fraud.” Wright had claimed that he controlled the addresses. Maybe they should have just asked Wright if he owned a Mac. Laszlo Hanyecz, the “Bitcoin pizza guy” who worked with Satoshi to develop Bitcoin, has said that Satoshi only worked on Windows. Kenneth Blanco, Director of the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), warned in an interview with Chainalysis against bad actors as well as rogue nations hijacking blockchain technology.

A crypto-enthusiast could soon control the Fed though. President Trump’s nominee for the US Federal Reserve board of governors, Judy Shelton, has talked of a return to a gold standard, with a side of cryptocurrency. Other national banks appear to be moving the same way. The Bank of Lithuania has completed research into its blockchain project, LBChain. Antigua and Barbuda’s House of Representatives has passed a bill that will start to make the region a friendly place for digital assets. China, too, looks set to promote its DCEP digital currency, which is backed by the country’s central bank, as a rival to the US dollar.

Private industry also continues to warm to the blockchain. Household goods manufacturer LG has joined the governing council of Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera wants to build an enterprise-grade blockchain platform to benefit businesses and consumers. Coinbase is buying brokerage Tagomi in order to cash in on the rise of hedge fund and macro investors in cryptocurrencies. In the world of online entertainment, Dapper Labs, the maker of CryptoKitties, is swapping cute digital cats for collectible digital basketball cards in a deal with the NBA.

Key Takeaways Coinbase is running an OmiseGo airdrop for its customers

The airdrop delivers funds distributed by OmiseGo in 2017.

Share this article

Coinbase gave some of its users free OmiseGo tokens this week, following its decision to list the cryptocurrency on its exchange. This news comes almost three years after OmiseGo carried out its original airdrop, which ran the summer of 2017.

The OmiseGo Airdrop

In July 2017, OmiseGo took a snapshot of all Ethereum addresses. Addresses that held more than 0.1 ETH were eligible for the airdrop. The airdropped tokens were then distributed over September. In total, 5% of the OmiseGo supply was distributed this way, and over 460,000 users received rewards in their Ethereum wallets. Users received 0.075 OMG for every 1 ETH held.

Since Coinbase did not support OMG balances until now, there was no way to give users those funds at the time. As such, Coinbase’s new airdrop simply delivers those overdue rewards.

Other crypto exchanges, such as Poloniex and Bitfinex, have run similar retroactive OMG airdrops—though those occurred much closer to the actual airdrop date than Coinbase’s did.

Too Little Too Late?

Coinbase’s decision may not be as generous as it seems. The market value of OMG has declined significantly over the past few years. Once a top-twelve token, it now ranks #38 by market cap.

During its September 2017 airdrop, OMG was worth $9.40. By January 2018, it was worth $25.00. Now, the token is worth about $1.60.

Presumably, Coinbase had access to the airdropped tokens at the peak of their value but did not share that value with its customers.

Recent Price Surge

On a more positive note, Coinbase’s decision to list OmiseGo has generated a short-term price surge for the cryptocurrency.

The value of OMG increased by 200% over one week, starting at $0.76 on May 14 and reaching $2.04 on May 22.

Even if these relatively high prices do not last, they give airdrop recipients greater profits than they may otherwise experience. Binance.US, which went live last year, is also listing OmiseGo today. That could have further positive effects on the token’s market price.

Chase Bank NA, the sixth-largest bank worldwide and a subsidiary of banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co, will pay approximately $2.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that it overcharged customers for buying cryptocurrency using its credit cards.

The sum was reported by Reuters following a court filing on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. JPMorgan Chase admits no wrongdoing in the settlement, and customers who are part of the class will receive approximately 95% of the previously-paid fees back.

Plaintiffs Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton, and Stanton Smith originally filed suit in 2018 after being hit with exorbitant fees for crypto purchases, alleging that there was no advance warning of Chase’s policy change.

Key Takeaways Justin Sun's early years in school paint a picture of a loud rebel, constantly going against the grain.

Before founding Tron, he was an early employee at Ripple Labs and helped the company's influence in China.

Many of his controversies are linked to outlandish claims on Twitter as well as high-profile meetings with legends of finance.

Share this article

Justin Sun, the 29-year-old entrepreneur behind Tron, has been a controversial figure in the crypto industry, often evoking mixed reactions to his publicity stunts and outspokenness on social media.

Nonetheless, Sun is an important driving force in the sector as both his past and future endeavors put him among the most prolific entrepreneurs in tech today.

We take a look at the life of the self-proclaimed “protégé of Jack Ma” and the face of the TRON empire.

Sun’s Early Life and Non-Tech Beginnings

Born in 1990 as Sun Yuchen, Justin Sun has always shown a strong proclivity for fame and attention. A good student, Sun was enamored with liberal ideas and never shied away from standing up to authority.

In an early GQ profile of Sun published in China, he recalled his school days, saying he was often the “campus opinion leader” who often went against the mainstream. A vocal critic of school policies, Sun was also a prolific writer churring out articles filled with heavy criticism of the Chinese government.

The first time Sun got a taste for fame came after the middle school he attended in the city of Huizhou announced plans to tailor academic guidance to students according to various categories.

That meant that students from low-income families and those believed to have “extreme views” would receive alternative guidance from teachers than those headed to college.

Sun heavily criticized the decision in a widely circulated online post that made the rounds across China.

He called the effort “a cruel thing” that aims to institutionalize the tight control over students and compared the school system with Nazi Germany.

It was through posts like this that helped Sun gain nation-wide fame both online and in print media. He was featured on the cover of Hong Kong-based magazine Yazhou Zhoukan, which described him as a young “opinion leader.”

“Some might argue that Sun became an opinion leader just to become famous, but I think it was more of a natural result of the overall social atmosphere back then in China,” journalist Zhang Jieping, who interviewed Sun for the Yazhou Zhoukan cover story, told Quartz.

The outspoken and energetic Sun went on to attend Peking University and earn a bachelor’s degree in history in 2011. Two years later, he obtained a master’s degree in political economy from the University of Pennsylvania.

According to Quartz, this is when he first came across the very niche world of cryptocurrencies. Through incredible foresight or just sheer luck, Sun became a millionaire by investing in Bitcoin in its early days.

While the extent of his investments in Bitcoin is still unknown, upon his return to Beijing in 2013, he was already one of the youngest crypto millionaires.

Foray into Tech and the Creation of TRON

Sun’s return to China marked the beginning of a busy year for the ambitious entrepreneur.

He soon joined Ripple Labs, a then-young company working on the creation of a cross-border payment settlement system that would yield XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

As Ripple’s first employee in the country, he served as the company’s chief representative for the greater China region and later became an advisor.

At the time, Sun’s time was divided between Ripple and Peiwo, a social media app he created that connects like-minded users via live audio chats based on ten-second pre-recorded voice samples.

The platform quickly became popular among China’s teens, with a 2018 report saying the app’s users were mainly between the ages of 16 and 25. With more than ten million registered users and more than one million monthly active users, Peiwo, loosely translated to “call me,” was what put Sun on the map.

The Chinese government praised the young entrepreneur, who, in turn, said that China had “the best environment for entrepreneurs in the world.” Even Jack Ma, the legendary founder and CEO of online giant Alibaba, took notice of Sun and personally invited him to become one of the thirty students in the inaugural class of his Hupan University in 2015.

Sun attended the university for three years and graduated in 2018 with a thesis titled “The Birth of a Decentralized Internet.”

However, it remains unclear what subjects Sun took while at the university, as the only classes mentioned to the public were taught by Ma himself and were titled “CEO 101.”

Nonetheless, he said the time he spent at Hupan taught him both moral and business values, which he was eager to implement in all of his business ventures.

“I was able to take the experiences and knowledge shared by my professors and classmates and immediately put it into practice,” Sun told the South China Morning Post last year.

It was also the connections he made at Hupan that propelled him to fame both in China and worldwide.

Soon after enrolling, Sun was invited by Yu Jianjun, a Hupan University alumni and co-founder of the Chinese audio streaming company, Ximalaya FM, to share his story as a successful young entrepreneur online.

The podcast he launched in 2016, called “The Revolutionary Road to Financial Freedom,” earned him a cult following online.

A quick rise to fame propelled by his online presence and powerful connections led Sun to establish the Tron Foundation in 2017. The Singapore-based company was tasked with creating TRON, a blockchain-based, decentralized protocol project with an internal digital currency, Tronix (TRX).

To fund the ambitious project, the Tron Foundation conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) on Binance from Aug. 31, 2017, to Sep. 2, 2017, raising $70 million in the sale.

Apart from raising a significant amount of money, Sun couldn’t have picked a better time for the ICO—the sale was completed just before China clamped down on token sales with its notorious ICO ban. Most other token issuers were forced to migrate to more ICO-friendly places such as Hong Kong or Japan.

This positioned Tron as a leader in blockchain in China. With no apparent consequences from the state’s clampdown on the token issuance and $70 million to spend, the company quickly established partnerships with a series of major companies, including Chinese video hardware and software provider Baofeng (called the “Netflix of China”), and oBike, the largest bike-sharing company in Singapore.

How much Is Justin Sun Worth?

Justin Sun is one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency industry. His wealth comes primarily from his TRX token holdings. His wallet size is unknown, and he has refused to disclose his exact holdings.

It would be fair to estimate he owns roughly 10-20% of the total supply, which would value his TRX worth between $100 and $200 million.

He has also made significant investments in acquisitions of Poloniex—a cryptocurrency exchange that was once valued at $400 million, Steemit platform, and BitTorrent, which he acquired for $140 million. BitTorrent also has its tokens, which are called the BTT tokens with a market cap of $60 million.

Factoring all the data above, his net worth is expected to be between $200 to $400 million.

Despite his high net-worth, Justin Sun was recently found claiming small business relief funds for Tron from the U.S. government.

Developing TRON and Handling Controversies

While Sun’s outspoken personality might have pushed Tron into the spotlight, it was also what kept the spotlight on Tron when it faced some of its many scandals and controversies.

Sun famously quarreled with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, on Twitter, saying that Tron’s capabilities vastly exceeded that of Ethereum. Sun’s incredibly flawed comparison earned him a lot of criticism, both from Tron users and other industry figures.

Buterin himself accused Sun of copying Ethereum’s whitepaper, an allegation that follows the project to this day.

The year was especially busy for Sun, who acquired BitTorrent, the largest file-sharing platform in the world, for $126 million. Famously said to be responsible for almost 5% of all internet traffic, BitTorrent was regarded as an incredibly bold move for Tron.

The goal of the acquisition was to turn BitTorrent’s 100 million monthly active customers into TRX users—a notion that pushed TRX’s price through the roof immediately after the acquisition was announced. Ryan Selkis, chief executive officer at researcher Messari, said the market response to the purchase was “wild to watch.”

This wasn’t the first, nor the last, controversy that surrounded Sun or Tron. Few have managed to attract as much press as Sun’s, now legendary, lunch with Warren Buffet did.

In 2019, Sun famously paid $4.5 million for the opportunity to have lunch with the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett. Buffett has hosted similar lunches every year for decades, with all of the proceeds from the payment going to the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco-based charity which helps the poor, homeless, and those battling substance abuse.

Sun famously invited the U.S. President Donald Trump and other industry leaders to join him for lunch, but postponed two days before it was supposed to take place due to “health reasons.”

The cancellation had been met with widespread criticism and ridicule in the TRON community, particularly in China. Rumors began to circulate that Sun was unable to leave China due to a government-enforced “exit ban.”

However, the Tron Foundation denied these claims, saying that Sun was recovering from kidney stones in his San Francisco home.

Eventually, the adamant Bitcoin-critic and Sun met at a private country club in Buffett’s home city, Omaha, Nebraska, on Jan. 23, 2020. It was joined by eToro CEO Yoni Assia, Head of Binance Charity Foundation Helen Hai, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, and Huobi CFO Chris Lee.

But, before the dust from his long-awaited lunch with Buffett even settled, Sun was embroiled in yet another controversy, this time surrounding the decentralized content sharing platform Steemit.

After Tron acquired Steemit in February, Sun was accused of using the company to consolidate power over the once wholly decentralized blockchain. However, Steemit users managed to take back control of the Steem blockchain within days, pushing Sun out and leaving him at the mercy of the crypto community.

Despite the controversies, the crypto industry might not be that young anymore, but Sun certainly is, which leaves him ample time to do both good and bad for the space.

Recently, there have been some promising sightings. Grayscale Investments has been buying up Bitcoin (BTC) at a great rate in recent months.

Indeed, since the May 11–12 rewards halving event, the fund has been accumulating BTC at a rate equivalent to 150% of all the new Bitcoin mined, Cointelegraph reported on Thursday. The firm now has $3.2 billion in assets under management, or AUM, in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Significantly, more than 90% of new inflows are from institutional players, according to the company.

Grayscale may not be alone in attracting institutional attention. Eric Ervin, the president and CEO of Blockforce Capital, an asset management firm that operates in the crypto space, told Cointelegraph: “We are seeing more institutional interest. I think this would be true regardless of the halving or the QE taking place, even more so given the unprecedented fiscal and monetary global stimulus.”

Lennard Neo, the head of research at Stack Funds, told Cointelegraph that institutional investors have been looking for alternative solutions not just to provide returns but also to protect their existing portfolio from further downside risks, explaining:

“Similar to Grayscale, Stack has seen an uptick in investors’ interest — almost double that figures of pre-crash in March — in Bitcoin [...] I would not say they are ‘gobbling up BTC’ blindly but cautiously seeking traditional structured solutions that they are familiar with before making an investment.”

Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, told Cointelegraph: “We’re seeing increased interest from multiple levels of investors — wealth channels, independent RIAs and institutions.” The recent BTC halving came at an interesting time — amid the COVID-19 outbreak and the growing unease about quantitative easing. He noted: “It clearly demonstrated BTC’s scarcity and future supply reduction as concerns deepened around unprecedented stimulus by the Fed with the CARES Act.”

Goldman Sachs raises doubts

Not all are knocking at Bitcoin’s door, though. In a May 27 presentation to investors, Goldman Sachs, the storied investment bank, listed five reasons why cryptocurrencies are not an asset class, which included Bitcoin, noting: “While hedge funds may find trading cryptocurrencies appealing because of their high volatility, that allure does not constitute a viable investment rationale.”

Crypto’s denizens reacted combatively. Referencing the quality of Goldman Sachs’ recent Bitcoin research, Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss declared in a tweet: “Today, Wall Street is where you end up when you can’t make it in crypto” — and he followed up on May 28 with: “Day after Goldman Sachs says don’t buy bitcoin, bitcoin is up +$500.” Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics wrote in his May 27 newsletter: “Regardless of what Goldman Sachs sell-side analysts have to say, it’s quite clear that institutional interest has been picking up lately.”

On the matter of investment suitability, a recent Bitwise Asset Management research report made the case for adding Bitcoin to a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, noting that on average, “a 2.5% allocation to bitcoin would have boosted the three-year cumulative return of a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio by an astonishing 15.9 percentage points.”

Overwhelming the market?

In the roughly two-week period since the BTC rewards halving, which reduced miners’ block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, 12,337 Bitcoin were mined as reported by researcher Kevin Rooke on May 27. During that same period, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust purchased 18,910 Bitcoin — about 1.5 BTC for every Bitcoin created. This has raised some questions about the overall BTC supply.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on Rooke’s findings in a tweet: “There isn’t enough new supply to go around, even for just one guy [i.e., Grayscale].” Greenspan, for his part, told Cointelegraph: “It seems like institutional players are gradually becoming a much larger part of this small market.” Might they overwhelm the market? “Whales have always been an issue,” he opined.

As noted, Grayscale Investments reported $3.2 billion in AUM in late May. To put this in context, the total AUM of crypto hedge funds globally increased to over $2 billion in 2019 from $1 billion the previous year, according to the 2020 PricewaterhouseCoopers–Elwood Crypto Hedge Fund Report. Most crypto hedge funds trade Bitcoin (97%), followed by Ethereum (67%), with the vast majority of investors in crypto hedge funds (90%) being either family offices (48%) or high-net-worth individuals (42%).

This is an imperfect comparison, though, because the PwC–Elwood report only tracked hedge funds and excluded crypto index funds — including passive/tracker funds like Grayscale’s, which basically track the price of BTC. As PwC’s Global Crypto Leader Henri Arslanian told Cointelegraph, it “goes up or down solely based on the price of BTC and not due to the skills or activities of the fund manager.” It also excluded crypto venture capital funds that make equity investments in crypto firms. Still, the comparison suggests something of the magnitude of Grayscale’s BTC commitment.

When contacted by the Cointelegraph, Grayscale Investments declined to provide any specific details about its recent BTC buying spree, or why other institutional investors might be snapping up BTC. “We’re not going to talk about momentum following the halving until mid-July when we’ll publish our Q2 numbers,” a spokesperson said.

But Michael Sonnenshein, the managing director of Grayscale Investments, told Cointelegraph that investors have typically tried to shield their portfolios from market shocks or during times of uncertainty with fiat currencies, government bonds and gold:

“All three are facing issues this time around. Bitcoin has emerged as an alternative hedge, operating independently of the dramatic monetary policies enacted by central banks.”

Other Factors

The halving is the most dramatic and immediate recent BTC event, but industry sources mostly cited other reasons for the recent institutional attentiveness. Stimulus packages, like the $3-trillion coronavirus relief package passed by the United States House of Representatives on May 15 — and attendant fear of inflation — is chief among their concerns. David Lawant, a research analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, told Cointelegraph:

“In our view, institutional interest was on the rise since the beginning of the year, but it really took off after the unprecedented government response to the COVID-19 crisis.”

Neo cited rising geopolitical tensions, like those between the U.S. and China, which have put “further stress on an already weakened economy, and in turn, increased Bitcoin’s appeal.” Arslanian told Cointelegraph:

“We are continuing to see increased interest from institutional investors. But more than the halving, it’s the availability of institutional-grade offerings, from regulated crypto funds products to regulated custody and many offerings that are making this possible.”

The participation of hedge fund icons like Paul Tudor Jones has to be factored in as well. Jones’ recent letter “making the case for Bitcoin as his preferred hedge against what he calls ‘the great monetary inflation’ has significantly reduced career risk for many of his peers considering an allocation to Bitcoin,” Lawant told Cointelegraph. In a May investment report, Cappelli wrote:

“Not only has institutional infrastructure progressed, but as the world changes important players are entering the space. The most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance Technologies, recently announced their intention to trade bitcoin futures.”

Attracting notice

Lawant believes that: “In the lenses of mainstream investors, I think that 2020 is the year in which Bitcoin moved from being a venture capital bet to a macro hedge.”

What’s more, the halving event had some impact, too, as Arslanian believes that more attention has been brought to how Bitcoin works, adding: “The fact that this happened as the world is going through record quantitative easing from central banks also brought attention on how money is created and the role that it plays in society.” People who were otherwise ignoring this asset class are now starting to take notice, added Ervin. He continued:

“Like any disruptive technology or asset class, first the explorers and pioneers, then slowly more people enter, before finally the technology ‘crosses the chasm’ and reaches mainstream adoption and investment. I would say we are in the very early days.”

To summarize, global unemployment has been soaring, and economic stimulus is clearly on the minds of governments and central banks. The European Commission’s recently proposed $826-billion virus recovery plan was just the latest instance. Quantitative easing may be necessary under these unique circumstances, but it set off inflation alarm bells among some institutional investors.

The halving event may not have persuaded financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin, but it did remind them, once again, that BTC, unlike fiat currencies, has a fixed supply (21 million BTC). Given the world’s inflation anxieties, is it surprising that institutional players might throw some hedge fund money Bitcoin’s way?",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-prime-brokers-resilience-risk-coinbase-bitgo-genesis,"There are many types of hockey-stick evolutions in new industries.

And a subsector can simmer along with a low hum of activity until boom, years of progress and feverish months of under-the-surface connecting explode in a series of announcements and launches that signal a new phase of development.

Over the past few days several “blue chip” names (by crypto market standards) have revealed plans to knit new connective systems for crypto trading and investment, with the experience and the backing to make a meaningful difference.

This week crypto exchange Coinbase announced the acquisition of crypto prime broker Tagomi in an all-share deal that boosts the exchange’s institutional offering and gives Tagomi access to a strong balance sheet.

BitGo, one of the sector’s largest custodians, launched its prime broker services, adding lending and software to its existing suite of services.

And last week, Genesis Capital* revealed the acquisition of crypto custodian Vo1t, which will enable it to add custody to its institutional lending and trading.

Why now?

Several startups have been offering what they call “prime brokerage” services for institutional crypto investors, focusing on efficient order routing, but they generally lack the balance sheets and industry weight to be able to offer the crucial prime functions of lending, clearing and custody.

This lack of full service has been a barrier to institutional involvement in the industry.

The crypto market is different from traditional markets in that its exchanges operate as siloed units, each with different order books, prices and onboarding requirements. Investors need to set up and fund accounts at each platform on which they want to operate, which is a cumbersome use of time and an inefficient use of capital. It also precludes “best price” execution as, even if a certain exchange offers a better price at a given moment, investors may not be able to trade on that exchange in time to take advantage of it.

Prime brokers that reroute orders can solve part of the fragmentation of crypto markets by giving investors access to several exchanges via one account. But institutional investors also expect greater capital efficiency through leverage, netted collateral, convenient custody and seamless access to a broad range of products.

Bigger is better?

Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis are three of the more well-known institutional names in crypto markets, with strong revenues, growth trajectories, balance sheets and networks. All have been in acquisition mode recently, strengthening teams and service offerings. And all have strong backers.

This is significant, because any investor who lived through the painful fall of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will stay well away from a prime broker that carries even the slightest risk of insolvency.

It is also significant because only well-backed and strongly solvent companies can afford to offer lending along with routing and custody, without adding undue risk to the balance sheet. This service will unlock a significant capital inefficiency barrier, and perhaps encourage participation from a wider range of institutional investors.

Unfortunately, the limited range of infrastructure firms that can offer the full prime brokerage suite of services means we are likely to see growing concentration in this field. This introduces new risks to the sector.

One is the strong degree of centralization in a sector built on the premise of decentralization and resilience. By replicating market structures from traditional finance, we are introducing some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities, such as concentration of power (with the possibility of censorship), dependence on a handful of suppliers (in which one firm’s crisis could ripple through the whole market) and the additional layers of cost.

On the other hand, asking “mainstream” institutional money to get its collective head around an entirely new type of asset and market structure is probably a non-starter, especially when the new technologies aim to disrupt the way of life on which institutional money depends. A familiar investment process will smooth the entrance for many.

Another risk is conflicts of interest. Will clients trust the Coinbase/Tagomi prime broker to route orders to the best price available, even if it’s not on Coinbase? Could competing exchanges be shut out in favor of Coinbase and allies? In traditional finance, the largest prime brokers (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc.) are also among the largest broker/dealers. But they operate in much more regulated sectors, where “best price” is a legal obligation for many orders. This is not the case in crypto markets.

Rehypothecation could also start to rear its alarming head. One reliable source of income for traditional prime brokers is the lending out of clients’ collateral and assets in custody. This way, capital use becomes even more efficient, but the crypto collateral could end up in a convoluted web of ownership, undermining the very meaning of bearer assets and introducing a long trail of potentially incendiary flare-ups should anything go wrong with the original custodian or any of its clients.

What’s next?

While the new entrants to the crypto prime broker space will galvanize the sector as a whole in terms of a greater degree of professionalization of market infrastructure, which in turn is likely to attract a new type of market participant, the sector is still new and niche. Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis are big, but they’re not Goldman Sachs. They may be “blue chip” names to those of us in the sector, but the larger institutions will probably not have heard of them.

The large, conservative institutions could decide to wait until their long-standing prime brokers start to offer crypto services. That will be the bigger game-changer.

Goldman astonishes

Speaking of Goldman Sachs, it hosted a virtual presentation this week titled: “US Economic Outlook & Implications of Current Policies for Inflation, Gold and Bitcoin.”

I didn’t sit in on the call, so this is mainly based on the slide deck. For the economic forecast section, they wheeled out the big guns. Jason Furman has an arm’s-length curriculum of top economic posts, including professor of economic policy at Harvard and adviser to President Obama. He gave an interview on NPR earlier this week insisting that we were not looking at an economic depression, more like a recession, with the following insight: “A very bad recession is a problem. I think we should be doing everything we can to avoid it.”

The other author, Jan Hatzius, is also no economic slouch – as well as chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he is the holder of several forecasting awards. He apparently shares Furman’s relatively rosy outlook on the economy (and remember, he’s a good forecaster), saying on CNBC earlier this month that the jobs slump has not been as bad as he feared and that he expects most of the unemployed to be redeployed.

Their presentation forecasts GDP growth in 2021 of over 6%, with muted inflation. Yay.

All this must come as a huge relief to Goldman clients, to hear from two experts that things will be back to normal soon, so there’s no real need to change investment strategies.

These renowned economists did not write the asset-focused part of the presentation – that was done by the Investment Strategy Group (ISG) within the Consumer and Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs. A footer in the presentation notes that the ISG is not part of Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research nor Goldman Sachs Global Markets Division, and its views may differ. So, this isn’t a case of Goldman flip-flopping on its previous interest in bitcoin. It’s a case of differing views within the organization. Fair enough.

The team concluded that neither gold nor bitcoin are good investments. Gold has underperformed both equities and bonds for extended periods of recent history. And bitcoin is not an asset class because it has no cash flow, earnings or portfolio hedge properties. And, this may come as a surprise to you: “a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients.” (My emphasis.) As Jill Carlson pointed out in her brilliant takedown of the report, “the fact someone else is willing to pay a higher price for a given instrument is probably the only criteria necessary to know something is a suitable investment.”

The revealing explanation for the team’s stance on bitcoin lies in the last three words of the report’s previously mentioned conclusion: “for our clients.”

This says so much more about the team’s clients than it does about bitcoin. The division manages private and corporate money, and I imagine you don’t park your wealth at Goldman for it to undertake risky plays. You park it there to have your hand held. Goldman’s ISG clients obviously want to know that their blue-chip investments are safe, that no pesky depressions are going to get in the way and no irksome threats from edgy assets will disrupt their comfortable portfolio structures, which no doubt include a hefty dose of bond, equity and real estate funds that provide nice management fees to the firm.

I’ll do you the favor of skipping a critique of the other five slides, with their escalating inanity. I will say that I’ve seen deeper insight on Fox News.

Let’s take a moment to appreciate, however, that they’re talking about bitcoin at all. We can conclude that their clients have been asking.

We’ve seen this before, in the blind eye to growing risk in the financial system back in 2007-8, in the “it’s just the flu” chant of early 2020, and now in the “everything will be fine” mantra of private money managers. We’ve seen before how a lack of interest in real downside leaves portfolios vulnerable. We’ve seen before how top-level experts are usually reluctant to shake the tree that gives them fruit, and we all know that telling clients things they don’t want to hear is not always a good business strategy for money managers.

We also know that good money managers aren’t afraid to do so. Good money managers look at the whole spectrum of risk, not just the middle part. Good money managers don’t wear rose-tinted glasses with blinkers. And good money managers actually research an asset before giving a presentation on it.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

The re-opening of the NYSE infused the markets with a sense of optimism that even the crescendo of trade tensions and the escalation of social unrest could not dent, and the S&P continued its upward trend.

The “back to work” narrative will have pushback, however, from the “new cold war” narrative emerging as I type, and from the relative absence of consumer demand – U.S. consumer spending plunged 13.6% in April, more than expected and almost double March’s slump.

It’s interesting to note that the Nasdaq underperformed the S&P 500 for the first time in weeks – its habitual outperformance that you can see in the YTD figures imply that the market rally has been concentrated in tech stocks. It seems that buying interest is now spreading to other sectors such as cyclicals and small-caps.

Bitcoin reversed a couple of weeks of declines, although the price ranged 10% from its weekly low to its weekly high, so timing is everything. Corporate developments lent a constructive tone to the narrative, overriding any disappointment from the cursory treatment from Goldman Sachs’ private investment team (see above).

Source: Coin Metrics

This brings up an interesting question: what is the prevailing narrative now that the halving is over? I think it’s the big steps forward in market infrastructure development as big prime brokers muscle in to entice institutional money. Yes, we’ve heard that mantra before – but this time, the infrastructure is getting in position. This may not be enough to make a meaningful difference in volume just yet. But it is a step towards standardization of the bitcoin market, which could enhance liquidity and lower volatility.

CHAIN LINKS

Crypto data provider Kaiko ran some numbers on bitcoin’s volatility compared to that of equities, gold and the U.S. dollar, and showed that the ratio between BTC and S&P 500 volatilities is increasing but still notably lower than in January. TAKEAWAY: This is not surprising given the general market turmoil at the end of Q1, where the volatilities of both shot up. Since then, however, the S&P 500 volatility has been settling down while BTC volatility has jumped in the month of May.

Source: Kaiko

Bitcoin held on crypto exchanges hit an 18-month low, down 11% so far this year, while the amount of ether held on the same exchanges has increased by 7% over the same period. Glassnode showed, however, that bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not evenly distributed, with some balances remaining consistent or even increasing, while others such as those on Bitfinex have dropped over 60%. TAKEAWAY: So the conclusion that “people are holding more than before” does not hold up under closer scrutiny. The theory is that, if investors want to hold on to their bitcoin for a while, they remove them from exchanges to custody them in more secure solutions. Thus, declining exchange balances is a bullish signal. But if that trend is concentrated on just a handful of exchanges, then there could be something else going on.

Last week I pointed out that bitcoin transaction fees were rising sharply. Well, now they’re falling, but are still well above pre-halving levels. TAKEAWAY: This could be a consequence of last week’s mining difficulty decrease, which should entice more miners back into production as it becomes more profitable. This marginally reduces the interval between blocks, which could ease pressure on fees.

Source: Glassnode

Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder Ventures, reminded us that, in the past, the CNY/USD exchange rate and the bitcoin price have been correlated. TAKEAWAY: That doesn’t mean they will be again, but the relationship could be worth watching, especially as trade tensions and geopolitical posturing continue to play out in the currency markets. The theory is that a depreciating yuan will send savers into bitcoin as a currency hedge.

Crypto derivatives platform ErisX has launched an API for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin block trading. TAKEAWAY: As well as facilitating liquidity in cryptocurrencies with smaller tokens (where large orders could move the price), this is yet another signpost in the evolving professionalization of the sector.

Digital asset manager CoinShares has launched the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index (CGCI), the first EU Benchmark Regulations-compliant index that combines digital assets and gold. TAKEAWAY: This brings bitcoin and traditional assets such as gold even closer together in the minds of portfolio managers by combining them into one index, designed to play on the relative lack of correlation between the two. The firm is looking into deploying the index as an investable benchmark, providing yet another example of how crypto assets are giving rise to innovative investment vehicles.

An attempt to help blockchain companies based in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley via loans backed by a sovereign wealth fund has been blocked by the Swiss government. TAKEAWAY: Times sure have changed when what used to be a center for initial coin offerings is now relying on government bailouts for funding.

This suggests in hindsight that the event was priced in.

However, the top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has not given up much ground following the event, which suggests that traders who purchased before halving are confident that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

While Bitcoin has been consolidating in the past few days, the action has shifted to altcoins whose market capitalization has risen from about $77 billion on May 11 to $94 billion at press time.

Investors are now wondering if altcoins can continue their strong run while Bitcoin takes a breather, or will the action again shift back to Bitcoin?

Let’s find out by analyzing the charts to see which major cryptocurrencies could offer trading opportunities in the next few days.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which suggests that the bulls and the bears are digesting the sharp rally from the lows. With three touches on the resistance line of the triangle and two touches on the support line (marked via ellipses on the chart), the formation is complete.

BTC-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the bulls can propel the BTC/USD pair above the triangle, the next leg of the uptrend is likely to continue. Although the pattern target of this setup is $11,778, the bears are likely to defend the $10,500 levels aggressively.

However, if the bulls can push the price above $10,500, it will complete the breakout of a large symmetrical triangle. This move could signal the possible start of a new long-term uptrend.

The bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or from $10,000 and breaks below the support line of the symmetrical triangle. A break below $8,130.58 could signal the start of a possible downtrend.

BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. They have been mounting a stiff resistance in the $9,800-$10,000 zone.

However, if the pair turns around from the current levels or from $9,400, another attempt to breakout of the triangle is likely. The traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above the triangle before buying.

The stop-loss for the trade can be kept at $9,400 because if the bears drag the price back into the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout was a bear trap.

If the pair breaks below $9,400, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A strong bounce off this level could also offer a buying opportunity.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) has reached the overhead resistance at $18.1377, which is acting as a stiff resistance. However, if the bulls can push the price above the resistance, a rally to $21.7628 is possible.

BNB-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Both moving averages have started to turn up and the relative strength index is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.

Even if the 8th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels, it is likely to find support at the trendline. A bounce off the trendline will increase the possibility of a break above $18.1377 as it will suggest that the bulls are buying the dips aggressively.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the trendline. Below this support, a drop to $15.7218 and then to $14 is likely. The bulls are likely to defend $14 aggressively as it has not been broken since April 30.

BNB-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The bulls had pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $18.1377 but they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests that the bears are not willing to give up without a fight.

If the bears sink the BNB/USD pair below the 20-simple moving average, the short-term momentum will weaken.

On the other hand, if the pair bounces off the current levels, the bulls will make another attempt to scale the price above $18.1377. Traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $18.1377 with a stop-loss below the 50-SMA. The stops can be trailed higher as the price moves northwards.

Another possible buying opportunity will open up after the price rebounds off the trendline support. The stop-loss for this trade can be kept just below the trendline.

XLM/USD

Stellar Lumens (XLM) resumed its uptrend after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle on May 30. Both moving averages have started to slope up and the RSI has risen above 60 levels, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.

XLM-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The bears might defend $0.076994 aggressively but if the bulls can push the price above this level, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum. The target objective of a breakout of the triangle is $0.0875.

As the 12th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap had turned down from close to $0.088 levels on three previous occasions (marked as ellipses on the chart), this level is likely to again act as a major barrier.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the altcoin turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support line of the ascending channel. Below the channel, the trend could turn in favor of the bears.

XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

On the 4-hour chart, both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests that bulls are in command. A breakout of $0.076994 is likely to attract further buying.

Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.076994. The initial stop-loss for the trade can be kept at $0.070. The stops can be trailed higher as the price moves up.

However, if the bears can drag the price below the 10-exponential moving average, a drop to the 20-SMA is possible. If this support also gives way, a drop to the support line of the symmetrical triangle is possible.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) has reached the critical overhead resistance of $68.4175. The price had turned down from close to this level twice before, hence, this level is likely to act as a major barrier.

XMR-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the bulls can drive the price above $68.4175, the 16th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is likely to pick up momentum and could rally to the next resistance at $86.2384.

Conversely, if the digital asset reverses direction from the current levels, a drop to the moving averages and below it to the trendline is possible. If the bulls buy the dip to the trendline aggressively, it will increase the possibility of a break above $68.4175.

However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, a drop to $51-$54 zone is possible. Below this zone, a new downtrend is possible.

XMR-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

Although bulls pushed the XMR/USD pair above $68.4175, they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests that bears are defending the resistance aggressively. However, the pair has held the 20-SMA, which suggests that the bulls are buying the dips.

Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $68.4175 with a stop-loss at $65.

The momentum will weaken if the pair breaks and sustains below the 20-SMA. A break below $65 can drag the pair to the trendline. A strong bounce off the trendline can also offer a buying opportunity.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) broke out of the critical overhead resistance of $0.0167242, which is a huge positive because between April 29-May 9 the bulls had repeatedly failed to do so.

TRX-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the bulls can sustain the 17th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap above $0.0167242, the momentum is likely to pick up. The first target to watch out for is $0.0183655 and then $0.0213539.

Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.0167242, a drop to the trendline is likely. A strong bounce off the trendline could lead to one more attempt by the bulls to resume the up move.

The trend will turn in favor of the bears on a break below the trendline. If this support gives way, a drop to $0.0128935 is possible.

TRX-USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls propelled the price above the overhead resistance of $0.0167242 but the bears are not ready to give up without a fight.

Currently, the bears have dragged the TRX/USD pair back below the breakout level. If the price sustains below $0.0166, a drop to the moving averages is possible.

Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command. Therefore, the bulls are likely to buy the dip to the moving averages. Traders might consider buying at $0.0173 or purchasing on a rebound off the moving averages.

A break below the moving averages could result in a drop to the trendline which can also offer another buying opportunity. Long positions can be avoided on a break below the trendline.

Smart contract platform Cardano (ADA) is having an impressive week as the cryptocurrency is up nearly 12% at time of writing, printing a low of $0.64018 and a high of $0.07725 in the last 24 hours. ADA continues to surge days after Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson revealed the time frame for the launch of Shelley, which is Cardano’s next major upgrade.

Cardano competitor Ethereum (ETH) is also spearheading the altcoin charge. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up over 5% at time of writing, posting a 24-hour low of $218.74 and a high of $244.05. The cryptocurrency’s rally comes in the midst of anticipation of Ethereum 2.0’s release.

Asset ranking platform Weiss Ratings highlights that altcoins were more bullish than Bitcoin in the week ending May 28. In the previous week, the Weiss Large-Cap Crypto Index which is made up of the 10 largest coins, dominated by Bitcoin, rose 3.14%. Meanwhile, the Weiss Mid-Cap Crypto Index is up 7.46% over the same stretch, led by Cardano’s resurgence.

The financial ratings agency also notes the red hot performance of small-cap coins. The Weiss Small-Cap Crypto Index climbed by 15.22%, as highly speculative small-cap cryptocurrencies posted huge gains early in the week.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $9,597, up over 1% at time of writing.

press release

The one who called himself Satoshi Nakomoto, created cryptocurrency so that anyone can keep their financial life untouchable and protected from the interference of others. However, requirements of customer disclosure put these principles at risk and ordinary users under threat of theft, extortion, and even kidnapping by bandits. Find out how you can protect yourself from this.

Why Should Your Cryptocurrency Be Anonymous?

To ensure the inviolability of personal financial information when creating cryptocurrency, Blockchain, which is a decentralized data storage system that can not be cracked, was taken as the basis. But the requirements of mandatory checks KYC / AML, then put forward by governments of many countries to companies operating with cryptocurrencies, do not contribute to maintaining the confidentiality of users personal info.

The problem is that companies such as crypto exchanges are favorite targets for hacker attacks, when personal data of users fall into the hands of attackers. Because of this, users whose data has been stolen are not only in danger of losing their digital assets, but also run the risk of real physical harm.

In the modern world, cyber crime it’s not a separate thing, criminal gangs often consist of representatives of different professions, so the data stolen by hackers is not only used to crack email and digital wallets, but also used by bandits and professional extortionists. Due to the analysis of transactions in the open cryptocurrency blockchain, attackers can easily identify the real owners of crypto addresses, and then their location. After that, getting under the pressure of various criminal gangs who can knock out information from their victims is easy.

So the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions becomes not just a matter of preference, but a prerequisite for maintaining your digital assets, health, and in some cases even your life. This is especially true for those crypto holders who own significant amounts. Your data that is stored on the crypto exchange due to hacking can fall into the hands of interested parties who can use it against you.

Unfortunately, there are already quite a lot of cases of robberies, abductions and even killings of crypto owners and they are happening all over the world, so you should not assume that digital currencies concern only the virtual world. Tracking transactions on the blockchain, people were tracked down, abducted, and even burst into their houses with weapons. The only reliable way to protect yourself from such incidents is to follow the elementary safety rules on the network and ensure the anonymity of your crypto transactions.

How to Protect Against the Threat of Tracking?

You can prevent the identification of your personality. You can do this if you mix your Bitcoin. Special Bitcoin mixing services have been developed for a relatively long time. Using algorithms for mixing coins from different wallets, they break the chain of transactions between two addresses that could be tracked.

Your crypto operations can be easily monitored in an open blockchain system if you directly send coins to the address of another person or company. When using the Bitcoin mixer, your transaction is distributed in parts among many unrelated addresses and passes through different wallets several times. After that, the transaction amount comes to the address you specified from different sources, which confuses the traces of coins and therefore does not allow any to track you.

That is why most professional traders and crypto investors use the BTC mixer when they withdraw earned cryptocurrency from exchanges and investment platforms, because they usually operate with large amounts that are always of interest to attackers who analyze the blockchain.

However, not every Bitcoin mixer is worth using, trusting it your digital money. In addition to frankly fraudulent sites that simply steal your money, there are those that promise anonymity, but do not actually provide it.

To bring light upon the query in motion, we’ll analyze long-standing economic theories versus economist’s doubts while taking under due consideration deeply-rooted market variables, projections, and global acceptance that are all bound to distill a change in the value of Bitcoin in one way or another.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

With these truths in mind, let’s begin.

What Crypto Enthusiasts Project

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long poised the likelihood of Bitcoin reaching $100,000.

Evidence of this can be noted from high-profile individuals such as Anthony Pompliano, Co-Founder and Partner of Morgan Creek Digital.

“…I still think Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by end of December 2021. Fixed supply. Increasing demand. Time will tell.”

Charles Hoskinson, Ethereum Co-Founder, had tweeted in late 2019:

Bitcoin's price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that's going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future pic.twitter.com/9vlgH4S7u2 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 22, 2019

Then, of course, we have the more recent actionable insights rendered through” The Great Monetary Inflation,” proclaimed by macro investor Paul Tudor Jones, who acquired Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation earlier this month.

Despite acquisitions and proclamations attesting to Bitcoin’s impending worth, one should also assess whether these claims are rather a publicity stunt to increase Bitcoin participation or rather a deep-rooted belief originating from a coupling between past experiences and a desperate desire of riches to prolong extravagant lifestyles.

Regardless, these speculations should be taken with a grain of salt and weighed accordingly.

Addressing Economic Theory & Models

While crypto enthusiasts rely upon speculation in the crypto news, investors and Bitcoin participants tend to primarily formulate their assumptions upon tangible evidence that is derived from projection models and macroeconomic theories.

Projection models such as the Bitcoin S2F Model and M2 capitalization theory project astronomical valuations for Bitcoin, but as time has shown us, one of these models has already been debunked.

M2 Capitalization Theory

Over the past few years, and more prominent now as a method used to combat the financial ramifications of the Coronavirus pandemic, quantitative easing has been performed by countries’ central banks.

Take, for instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has been printing U.S. dollars at an exponential rate since 1970.

Perhaps the most noticeable effects of the exponential printing of U.S. dollars would be inflation, where the price of goods and services has been rising in unison to meet the money supply.

Generally, a healthy economy would be characterized through depreciation in prices due to entities finding more efficient and affordable alternatives for similar goods and services, but that is not the case.

To highlight the core point of this theory, should the Federal Reserve continue to print U.S. dollars at an exponential scale then; as a result, the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin will also continue to rise at an exponential rate until it has reached a value of $100,000 per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset Model

Also known as the Bitcoin S2F model, the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset Model ratio created by @100trillionUSD seeks to measure the effect of scarcity on BTC price through measuring current Bitcoin circulation and production rate.

As @100trillionUSD suggested in 2019 through Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity, “The predicted market value for bitcoin after May 2020 halving is $1trn, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000. That is quite spectacular. I guess time will tell, and we will probably know one or two years after the halving, in 2020 or 2021. A great out of sample test of this hypothesis and model.”

While it doesn’t take a mathematician to deduce how significantly short this economic model failed, up to 8 additional flaws have been reported regarding the Bitcoin scarcity valuation model.

As a result, we can no more put stock in economic theory than we can through unwarranted speculations.

Economists Debate

The most level-headed forerunners for predicting future Bitcoin prices may be contributed to economists who have yet to be proven incorrect regarding their cynical-based projections.

Such examples include the projection laid upon us by Kenneth Rogoff, an economist and Harvard University professor, who went on to express the following during a CNBC interview:

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

“I think bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now … I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000 ten years from now.”

“Basically, if you take away the possibility of money laundering and tax evasion, its actual uses as a transaction vehicle are very small,”

It should be noted that Rogoff isn’t the only economist who feels that Bitcoin won’t amount too much value in the future.

Joe Davis, a lead economist for Vanguard, a high-profile investment firm, stated, “I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible… As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero,”

“The bitcoin – its value is based off of scarcity – and an artificial scarcity that’s out there,” “It’s really tough to imagine where the long-term return comes from other than speculation.” – Joe Davis

If speculations regarding Bitcoin’s future applications are truly the driving force behind the volatility then the valuation of BTC as a whole is crippled as a result of diminished cash flow.

Black Swan Consideration

While speculation and debunked theories are two sides of the same coin, black swan events are an entirely different entity that has been known to characterize an era of hardship and uncertainty.

Unforeseen black swan events, such as the recent Coronavirus Stock Market Crash, have gone to illustrate that no economy is impervious to flaws while also dismantling the long-standing ideology that Bitcoin is a ‘safe have n’ asset.

Given the ramifications that can materialize from the wake of black swan events, no Bitcoin valuation can be complete without the possible occurrence of these devastating events.

To expand, modern times must be taken into account.

Such as, those of us reading this have already survived one black swan event but given how countries are starting to open their borders and governing states are once again re-opening their economies, the likelihood of another black swan event occurring as the byproduct of a second outbreak of Coronavirus only increases with each easing of confinement limitations folded back.

Therefore, it would be optimistic to the point of foolishness not to weigh these truths in your mind when speculating the possibility of BTC reaching $100,000.

Bitcoin Adoption Feasibility

One variable piece of the puzzle that can significantly influence Bitcoin’s likelihood of $100,000 per coin would be the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.

Should a significant surge in Bitcoin participation become present, then the generalized economic theory of supply and demand can be implemented as an increase in participation will likely be contributed to an increase in demand.

Through an increase in demand comes an appreciation of value, which given how Bitcoin supply is limited, should further strengthen the ideology that an increase in Bitcoin demand will increase the price of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Market Capitalization

Let’s ditch the economic theories and speculations to conduct some simple arithmetic.

The maximum sum of Bitcoins that will exist is 21 million.

Should the value of Bitcoin reach $100,000 per coin then the total potential market capitalization of Bitcoin, once all mined, would be equivalent to $21 million x $100,000 = $2,100,000,000,000 or $2.1 trillion.

According to CNBC in late 2019, the value of the global equities market surpassed $85 trillion, or $85,000,000,000,000.

It should be noted that the global value of the equities for 2019 started under $70 trillion, meaning it saw an increase of no less than $15 trillion throughout the year 2019.

To put that into perspective, should Bitcoin reach a value of $100,000 per coin (even if all were mined), that would mean that the market capitalization of Bitcoin would be more than 40x’s less than what the value of the global equities market was at the end of 2019.

($85,000,000,000,000 global equities value / $2,100,000,000,000 = 40.4761904762)

Putting the Pieces Together

Putting stock in speculations asserted by cryptocurrency advocates will get you no further than faulty economic theories that can in no way, shape, or form take under due consideration all the innumerable variables that nest their way into the ever-changing Bitcoin valuation equation.

Through M2 capitalization theory and the renowned principles of supply and demand, we are rendered rather convincing insights into the possibility that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 which is further strengthened when you compare the capped off Bitcoin market capitalization of $2.1 trillion to that of the $85 trillion for global equities in 2019.

While, at first, it may have seemed like a highly unrealistic projection of Bitcoin reaching $100,000, but when you stop to put it in perspective with the total value of global equities, then it may appear, to some, as only a matter of time.

Regardless, and to conclude, it is impossible to accurately predict the value of Bitcoin in 10, 20, or even 40 years from now, but if history has taught us one thing, it would be that anything is possible.",2020-05-31 07:41:03+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/162131-binance-owned-coinmarketcap-updates-its-cryptocurrency-pair-rankings-system/,"Digital asset market data aggregator CoinMarketCap recently revealed that it has introduced a different type of ranking system for cryptocurrency market pairs.

CoinMarketCap said it would begin using a new ranking system that takes several factors into consideration.

The leading crypto data site operator noted that the the market pairs of digital currency exchanges will be “algorithmically” scored based on overall liquidity, reported trading volume, and “an estimation of an exchange’s user base (via the proprietary Web Traffic Factor).”

Each cryptocurrency market pair will have to “score well” across all these aspects in order to “rank well,” CoinMarketCap’s blog post stated.

It added:

“The triage of factors is expected to provide a more comprehensive picture of each market pair, ensuring that users make better decisions on where to trade.”

It continued:

“Previously, the market pairs ranking was sorted by reported volume only, following the removal of the ‘adjusted volume’ metric for simplicity.”

CoinMarketCap has also made changes to its ranking methodology, which now includes a new Internet traffic metric. The data aggregation site says that it will continue to update its tools and services in order to provide better or more accurate digital asset data.

CoinMarketCap was recently acquired by Binance, the world’s largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. Binance claims that its acquisition will not affect how CoinMarketCap operates, because it will function as an “independent” business.

Binance has also claimed that there’s no “owner relationship” between it and CoinMarketCap, which is quite a questionable claim.

CoinMarketCap announced today that it aims to make “crypto job hunting in #quarantine [a lot] easier” It has teamed up with Crypto Jobs List to provide a list of open positions in the digital asset and blockchain job market.",2020-05-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/why-family-offices-should-consider-digital-assets-for-their-portfolios,"Constantin Kogan is a venture partner at BitBull Capital and has been a cryptocurrency investor since 2012. He has over 10 years of experience in corporate leadership, technology and finance.

Blockchain-based digital assets can be an alternative for investors hoping to reduce reliance on a failing traditional financial system. Because of this, institutions have kept a keen eye on happenings in the digital asset market – and wealthy investors, particularly family offices, could capitalize on the potential success story of blockchain’s ultimate breakthrough.

Many might say the over-discussed institutionalization of the digital asset market is a long way from fruition, and that may be true. However, current trends have spurred family offices, part of the institutional investor contingent, to increasingly adopt portfolio diversification strategies that support the allocation of funds to digital asset investments.

Although banks are much healthier than during the last crisis, lingering risks still exist within the financial sector (for example, nonbank mortgage servicers) during these unprecedented economic times. Because of this, investors can no longer depict cryptocurrency as a foray into the unknown but as an innovative financial tool. Because of this, there is increased focus from the family offices on digital assets as a good investment class.

What are family offices? Analysts estimate total family office assets under management is over $6 trillion. Among the investment activities of family offices is a preference to allocate to hedge funds, real estate and private equity. According to a UBS Global Family Office Report 2018, an average family office allocates 22% of its funds to private equities. Real estate is becoming popular (17%) and hedge funds have witnessed a slight decline to 5.7 percent.

A concept originated in Europe, family offices were first popularized by the House of Morgan (with a well-known investment titan named J.P.) and the Rockefeller family in the United States. Throughout the years, the growth rate of the family office industry has been unprecedented due to a constant influx of newly minted millionaires and billionaires. Today, there are more than 10,000 operational family offices globally.

A family office is an exclusive money management vehicle, allowing wealthy individuals or families to pull liquid assets together. The sole aim of family offices is managing, growing and preserving the wealth and legacies of such families. Recently, the concept has grown: It can now mean an organization that manages the wealth of two or more families, or multi-family offices.

Family offices and digital assets

The UBS Global Family Office Report indicates that 57% of family offices believe blockchain will transform investing strategies and behaviors in the future. This should come as no surprise. A recent Fidelity investment survey also revealed 22% of over 400 US-based institutional investors, including family offices and foundations, have explored investment products relating to digital assets.

This interesting revelation further drives the conversation about growing affinity for digital securities, blockchain-backed instruments that are tied to an underlying and tradable asset. This undoubtedly alters the perception that crypto has no future as a mainstream investment vehicle. Most striking is the fact that 72% of the investors in the Fidelity study declared no problems with buying digital asset-based investment products.

Perhaps the main reason for this is the low correlation to traditional assets attributed to blockchain-based digital investment products. While the correlation thesis is a strong one, liquidity is another credible reason why the influx of family office investment in the digital asset space is inevitable.

A blockchain antidote

The average family office holds up to 7% of its funds in cash, an investment strategy that guarantees unparalleled liquidity. However, the risks involved in long-term dependence on cash as a source of liquidity could eventually lead these entities to adopt digital assets.

For one, blockchain-based digital assets bypass the bureaucratic nature of traditional financial systems where middlemen feature prominently. There are also doubts surrounding the stability of fiat currencies, especially in today’s increasingly tension-stricken geopolitical landscape.

The cost of transacting and holding cash is indeed negligible in the short term. However, for an entity such as a family that values longevity and generational wealth, the long-term cost is not acceptable. An Accenture and McLagan report concludes blockchain technology could slash costs by 70% on central finance reporting; 50% on business and central operations; 50% on compliance; and more than 30% across the middle and back offices.

New investment technologies for family offices

Digital assets can give family offices access to the benefits of venture capitalism without the illiquid nature of conventional investment strategy. This approach will become viable as crypto custodial industries continue to innovate and mature as a sector within the blockchain industry.",2020-05-31 13:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/162103-coinbase-adds-maker-mkr-governance-token-will-support-mkr-btc-mkr-usd-trading-but-no-eth/,"San Francisco-based crypto exchangehas confirmed that on June 8, 2020, it will begin taking inbound transfers of(MKR) to, the platform for professional digital asset traders.

After sufficient supply of MKR tokens has been established on the exchange, the trading of MKR-USD and MKR-BTC order books will begin in phases, starting with “post-only” mode and then moving on to full trading if Coinbase’s metrics for a “healthy” market are met.

Maker (MKR) is an ERC-20 compliant utility token that holders can use to make governance-related decisions on the MakerDAO platform, which is an Ethereum-based decentralized lending system.

The Maker system manages the Ethereum-based Dai stablecoin, which aims to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the US dollar.

MKR tokens won’t be available for trading on Coinbase.com or through the exchange’s Consumer mobile applications. The exchange said it will make another announcement “if and when this support is added.”

In April of last year, Coinbase Pro had tried to add support for MKR tokens in a few jurisdictions, but “due to limited liquidity, these books failed to meet [the exchange’s metrics for a healthy market.” So, Coinbase’s management decided not to move forward with the trading.

Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, rose by over 8% last week and ended May with a 9.5% gain. That came after bitcoin jumped by nearly 35% in April, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Meanwhile, ether’s price rose by 16% last week and 12% for the month of May. Growth in ether’s non-price metrics, too, has been impressive compared to those for bitcoin.

For instance, the seven-day moving average of active ether addresses stood at 12-month high of 337,986 on Sunday, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. While ether’s active addresses have risen by more than 10% over the last two weeks, active bitcoin addresses declined by nearly 5%.

On a more positive note, bitcoin outshone major traditional assets in May. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, rallied by 2% over the month. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, fell by over 0.5% and the S&P 500 index rose by 4.5%.

Analysts expect both bitcoin and ether to maintain their bullish momentum over the near-term. While seasonality is positive for bitcoin in June, supporting the case for an extension of its two-month winning streak, ether is likely to benefit from Ethereum’s upcoming switch to the proof-of-stake mechanism.

Looking forward

Bitcoin has put in a positive June performance in six out of the last eight years. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has printed gains in the second quarter also in six out of the last eight years, as discussed previously.

Macro factors, too, are supportive of continued gains in bitcoin, according to analysts.

“Global tensions and uncertainties that have intensified over the past week and further support the Bitcoin narrative as an alternative investment to protect downside risks,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

President Donald Trump on Friday announced new, targeted sanctions against Chinese officials and directed his administration to revoke special trade exemptions for Hong Kong. The move came in retaliation to Beijing’s decision to curb Hong Kong’s autonomy by imposing a new security law on the city. The tensions could further escalate, as China is now considering plans to halt imports of soy from the U.S.

Dibb also expects the weakness in China’s yuan and the possible introduction of negative interest rates in the U.S. to bode well for bitcoin and precious metals like gold.

“Technically, we are expecting a break of $10,000 over the next two weeks and a further push to $11,000 by July,” Dibb added. Meanwhile, Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, said that, “BTC’s moment will be a clean break of the key round figure of $10,000.”

Indeed, bitcoin has failed multiple times in the last three weeks or so to shake off selling pressure in the range of $9,900 to $10,000. So, a convincing break above the psychological resistance could cause more buyers to join the market, leading to stronger gains.

At press time, the cryptocurrency is trapped in a narrowing price range. The direction in which the range is breached will likely set the tone for the next big move.

A bullish breakout could be seen, as investor sentiment is at its most bullish in years, according to on-chain data. For instance, nearly 60% of bitcoin’s supply hasn’t changed hands in over 12 months, a likely sign investors are holding in expectation of gains, according to Glassnode.

A similar percentage of supply was lying dormant for over a year at the start of the mega bull run in 2016.

Ethereum upgrade may boost price

Ethereum’s impending transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) in a major upgrade dubbed Ethereum 2.0 likely boded well for ether in May. Buying pressure for the cryptocurrency may remain strong in the near term, with the launch of Eth 2.0 due in Q3, 2020.

“It’s hard to be bearish with Ethereum staking coming soon. I suspect there will be a lot more ether staked than the projected 10-30 million. Perhaps even 50 million-plus if a lot of people select to stake through exchanges/rocket pool,” tweeted David Schwartz, a senior software engineer at Nash, a decentralized exchange.

Staking rewards network participants for holding coins, in a similar way to earning interest on savings.

The sharp rise in the number of addresses holding 32 ETH or more, an amount a holder is required to maintain as a balance to become a validator on Eth 2.0 (and hence earn staking rewards), suggests investors are accumulating coins in preparation for the upgrade.

Technical charts suggest that ether could continue to outperform bitcoin, too. The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend reversals, has crossed above zero on the ether-bitcoin monthly chart for the first time on record, as noted by popular analyst and engineer @IamCryptoWolf on Twitter.

ETH/BTC monthly MACD

The MACD’s move above zero indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change in the ETH/BTC exchange rate. Put simply, the market expects ether to fare better than bitcoin.

Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, expects bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market to benefit from the increased investor interest in ether. “The upcoming ETH 2.0 [upgrade] shall encourage more people to stake ETH and ultimately benefit the sentiments of the crypto market as a whole,” said Lai.",2020-06-01 12:31:02+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/06/01/crypto-analyst-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model-just-printed-a-signal-indicating-the-start-of-a-new-bull-cycle/,"The crypto strategist popular for applying the stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio to Bitcoin reveals that the model has printed a signal that has not been seen since the crypto bull run in 2017.

In a viral tweet, the anonymous analyst known as PlanB provides a crucial update to the S2F model for his 105,000 Twitter followers.

The S2F model compares the amount of commodity in circulation divided by the amount produced every year. The model is traditionally used to analyze the intrinsic value of precious metals such as gold and silver.

PlanB’s model shows that Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio increases as the rate of new BTC supply decreases over time. The crypto analyst also illustrates how the value of Bitcoin closely follows the cryptocurrency’s S2F ratio using dots, which represent the monthly closing price of BTC.

The first red dot after a series of blue dots signifies the first month after each halving, an event that reduces the pace of new BTC entering circulation.

The chart shows that Bitcoin’s S2F ratio has increased and now coincides with the appearance of the red dot in PlanB’s model – the first such dot in three years. Based on PlanB’s chart, a red dot indicates the start of a new bull cycle.

But some analysts are not convinced that history will necessarily repeat itself. Crypto trader Mr. TA notes that Bitcoin is still in an extended bear market.

“[It is the] first time [Bitcoin has] been in a downtrend going into the halving. Will be interesting for sure to see what happens this time.”

The price of bitcoin and a number of cryptocurrencies have been sliding downward in value during the last 72 hours, after bitcoin touched a high of $9,700 on May 30, 2020. On Monday, June 1, the price is up 0.06% and trading for $9,578 per coin during the morning trading sessions. The market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is around $270 billion, while 24-hour trade volume for all 5,000+ coins is $22 billion.

Crypto Value’s Slide After Briefly Touching Heavy Resistance

Cryptocurrency prices were rather bullish on Saturday evening as BTC and a number of other coins like ETH, BCH, XRP, and LTC were up in value. Bitcoin (BTC) touched a high of over $9,700 on Saturday evening and the price got pushed back at that point. The following Monday, BTC is swapping for $9,578 per coin and the crypto has around $5.9 billion in global trades.

ETH is trading for $239 per coin and is up 0.58% at press time. The third-largest market cap held by XRP is seeing around $475 million in trades and is priced at $0.20 per XRP. The stablecoin tether (USDT) still commands the fourth largest market valuation and more than 60% of the global crypto economy is paired with USDT.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD) Market Action

While BTC and other coins have been consolidating, bitcoin cash (BCH) has been rising in value. A single BCH is worth $243.91 per unit and there’s around $621 million in global trades. The top trading pair with BCH today is USDT and tether represents 73% of all bitcoin cash trades. Other pairs include BTC (15.49%), KRW (3.13%), USD (2.33%), ETH (2.16%), GBP (1.08%), USDC (0.70%), and PAX (0.56%). The overall market valuation of BCH is around $4.49 billion on Monday, June 1, 2020. BCH touched a high of $252 per unit on May 30 and the cryptocurrency is down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

Stock-to-Flow Hopium Expects $100k Bitcoin

Despite all the criticisms toward stock-to-flow (S2F) theories, the popular bitcoin pundit, Plan B, shared an S2F chart that shows some bullish trajectory. “Bitcoin S2F chart update… Red dot released,” Plan B tweeted.

The chart’s trajectory shows that BTC could touch an all-time high (ATH) of $50,000 to $100,000 in the near future. BTC has already touched an ATH of $19,600 per coin on December 17, 2017. Even though S2F charts are extremely bullish and Plan B’s chart shows extreme gains, lots of people dismiss these predictions and claim they are no different than the reading of tarot cards.

Some Believe Bitcoin Will be Smacked Down Again at $10k

One trader has noticed that the current upward trajectory is very similar to past movements, and BTC may be in a bull trap. “So far, the current BTC approach to $10k has shared elements of the prior two,” the Twitter account ’Hsaka’ tweeted. “Spot books heavily skewered to the sell side, lack of bid side backfilling, [and] no substantial derivatives interest (to cause a short squeeze). The only marked difference is ETH strength.”

The Twitter account ‘Calmly Full-Time Trader’ said: Deleted the last tweet because I’m not yet convinced. Just going to stay short until we make another high. Then if we start getting hourly closes above that high, I’ll flip long. Right now, still looking bearish.” Ever since the ‘Black Thursday’ bitcoin price bottom, bitcoin has coasted along rising toward heavier resistance levels at $10k and $11k. Many people believe that if BTC can push past this zone then it will give a more prominent bullish signal.

Market Analyst Says Short Liquidations Pushed the Market Price of Bitcoin Higher

A recent report written by the financial columnist Daniel Cawry details that short-seller liquidations may have been the catalyst to push BTC above $9,500. “Bitcoin broke through $9,500 Thursday and those short-sellers betting on lower prices got liquidated by some crypto derivatives exchanges,” Cawry wrote. “That also helped push the world’s oldest cryptocurrency higher.” Fairfield Strategies analyst Katie Stockton who says a push above $10k per unit would bolster bullish sentiment.

“A breakout above $10,055 would be a catalyst for significant upside in our work, and support is now defined by the 200-day moving average, which is now at $8,377,” Stockton told Cawry. “We think intermediate-term trend-following indicators are pointing higher,” Stockton added.

Vishal Shah, founder of the startup Alpha5 believes short liquidations and derivatives markets have been priming crypto markets.

“There are definitely topside liquidations on Bitmex, and more than on average,” Shah said. “I do think Bitmex is turning more into a fractal of the market than the anchor. Open interest is definitely in osmosis,” Shah added.

On June 1, Kahn took to Twitter announcing that he has spent the last month trading crypto assets. A screenshot shows Kahn’s portfolio to be valued at $7,949, with the hobbyist trader claiming to have gained 6% since investing $7,500 one month ago.

Kahn claims to have mostly “cashed out” at present, with roughly half of his portfolio currently tied to open orders for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) at lower price levels.

“If anyone has any ideas on crypto I’m open,” Kahn added to the Twitter thread.

Pop Stars Associated With Crypto

Since launching a production company, SuperMega Media, in 1999, Kahn has worked with many of the biggest stars in popular music, including Lady Gaga, 50 Cent, Eminem, Taylor Swift, and many others — several of whom have found momentary fame within the crypto industry.

In December 2019, a Monero (XMR) mining botnet hidden behind JPEG images of Taylor Swift was discovered. At the time, the botnet in question, MyKings, had taken in $3 million worth of XMR through a wide variety of attacks targeting Windows systems.

When Eminem released his tenth album ""Kamikaze"" in August 2018, cryptocurrency news outlets noted that the record’s ninth track ""Not Alike"" featured a shout out to Bitcoin — indicating the prominence crypto had gained in mainstream culture following the 2017 all-time high bull run:

“Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin.”

50 Cent claims to make millions from Bitcoin, files for bankruptcy

In 2014, Curtis ‘50 Cent’ Jackson accepted Bitcoin as payment for his fifth studio album ‘Animal Ambition’. The rapper sold nearly 80,000 copies of the album for $5.50 each in BTC — garnering roughly 700 Bitcoins.

In January 2018, 50 Cent claimed to have forgotten about his Bitcoin stash, following media estimates that his ambitious bounty had come to be valued at over $7 million. However, the following month, Jackson asserted that he had never owned any Bitcoin in bankruptcy court.",,https://www.coindesk.com/swiss-bank-premium-crypto-trading-service,"Private Swiss bank Maerki Baumann’s new crypto trading service shows there’s a growing market for providing premium execution for an institutional or wealthy clientele.

The entity promised its new crypto trading and custody service would provide clients with the best trading experience in a blog post last week.

“The trading orders placed with Maerki Baumann are directed to professional crypto brokers and the world’s largest and most liquid crypto exchanges via proven partner companies,” Maerki Baumann announced. “This ensures that transactions are carried out quickly and with a narrow trading range between the buy and sell price (spread).”

Maerki Baumann’s clientele includes institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). The bank has also offered corporate accounts for qualifying crypto businesses ever since it first made its entry into the space in April 2019.

Regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the new offering is set to go live sometime this month. Starting with bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH), the bank said it will gradually expand its list of supported assets based, in part, on client feedback.

But the takeaway here is premier crypto trading services, to a select, exclusive clientele, is a growing and lucrative market. Just last month, FalconX – a company offering best trade execution to institutional and professional clients with a minimum $10 million in assets under management (AUM) – raised more than $17 million in pre-seed and seed round funding.

Reading through the description, FalconX’s offering sounds near-identical to Maerki Baumann’s: Both are hooked up to the order books from multiple crypto exchanges, giving clients an overview of the market that allows them to transact at the best available price and with minimal slippage.

And they aren’t the only ones. Coinbase, Genesis Trading (CoinDesk’s sister company), and BitGo have all made plans to become prime brokers – a type of fixer that provide specialized trading services for institutional investors, including best trade execution.

Maerki Baumann has already said its new crypto trading and custody offering may just be the start. It wants to offer some of its private banking products to its crypto clients as well as launch a new crypto investment service, which could possibly include opportunities to invest directly in selected blockchain companies.",2020-06-01 17:15:08+00:00,https://decrypt.co/30898/us-gov-million-dollar-bounty-venezuela-crypto-chief,"In brief ICE and US Homeland Security have added Venezuela's crypto chief to its list of most wanted fugitives.

The US government is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to the capture of Joselit Ramírez.

ICE alleges Ramírez has violated money laundering laws and US sanctions.

The head of Venezuela’s cryptocurrency agency is now a wanted man.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, put out a bulletin today adding Joselit Ramírez, chief of the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip), to its list of most wanted fugitives.

And the US government is now offering a $5 million reward to whomever offers information leading to the arrest or conviction of Ramírez, who ICE alleges has “deep political, social and economic ties to multiple alleged narcotics kingpins.” Ramírez is himself wanted for “money laundering and sanctions evasion.”

The move comes the same day that Venezuela’s government has begun accepting the similarly sanctioned petro cryptocurrency for gasoline purchases. Venezuela last week received several shipments of gasoline from Iran, evading sanctions imposed by the United States.

Ramírez has been the head of Venezuela's crypto department since June 2018. His predecessor was Carlos Vargas, a well-known congressman and opposition leader who later worked with the Nicolas Maduro administration during the birth of the petro.

According the statement from ICE, Ramírez, 33, “has been indicted in the Southern District of New York for violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Kingpin Act, and other sanctions imposed by U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).”

Earlier this year, the US government announced that it was investigating Ramírez for his ties to other allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials. At that time, the US offered a $15 million reward for the capture of President Maduro, and $10 million for other high-profile officials, including Cliver Alcala, Diosdado Cabello, Hugo Carvajal, and Tareck el Aisammi. While Ramírez was mentioned among those being targeted, he had not been singled out for a bounty.

He did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.",2020-06-01 21:36:05,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-influencers-are-following-the-beauty-playbook-even-if-they-dont-know-it,"Beauty mogul Michelle Phan isn’t the only woman to notice similarities between makeup startups and crypto communities.

Both are dominated by influencer marketing with products sold through direct-to-consumer (DTC) models and aggregated retail platforms like Amazon, Etsy or Shopify.

In emerging markets without direct access to Amazon, Lebanese bitcoiner Michel Haber said grassroots traders often fill the role of educating clients and helping them procure their first wallets. Social media accounts and chat groups become ad hoc retail networks.

When it comes to grassroots distribution strategies, few mainstream industries offer a better precedent for the nascent cryptocurrency space than small beauty businesses, according to decentralized finance (DeFi) user and skincare aficionado María Paula Fernandez.

In both startup sectors, users are encouraged to do their own research rather than trust traditional tastemakers like magazines.

“I think DeFi and indie/new beauty [entrepreneurs] are very similar in this regard … bringing power to the people, generating opportunities,” she said. “There is no harm in learning about what’s in your beauty products. … It benefited consumers as well, as some of them can become influencers and broadcast their knowledge for compensation.”

Likewise, Fernandez said, she now looks for beauty products and crypto tools in similar ways. She builds up her own expertise, learning together with loved ones who work in the skincare industry, while also following influencers with professional experience in the field. So far, in the crypto industry, hardware wallet sellers predominantly rely on digital word-of-mouth. Much like the beauty marketing strategies on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, this includes sending products to crypto influencers to review and make instructional guides.

This typically matures into a referral marketing strategy that leverages these same fan groups.

For example, Iva Fiserova, head of communications at the Trezor wallet-maker SatoshiLabs, said the startup collaborates with social media influencers on “affiliate marketing activities” rather than paying influencers to advertise.

A few exchanges, like Binance and Gemini, have already proved successful with the referral model, which has worked for decades for multilevel marketing companies like Avon and Mary Kay cosmetics. As such, the Instagram micro-influencer Chjango Unchained, who works at Cosmos developer Tendermint during the day, said she’s been earning pocket money through the Gemini referral link in her Instagram bio for a few months.

If her fans use that link to sign up and buy more than $100 in crypto, she receives $10 in bitcoin.

“I just see people on Instagram doing it,” she said of promoting brands through her Instagram, where she started featuring professional portraits with brand tags in 2019. “I wanted people who ask me about crypto to use Gemini instead of Coinbase because Coinbase’s fees are insane.”

It remains to be seen how these marketing strategies will scale during the coronavirus recession.

YouTube giveaways

“We sometimes get in touch with [users] to help them engage their followers by doing giveaways and joining campaigns,” Fiserova said of SatoshiLabs’ influencer strategy.

Unlike beauty brands, which look for experienced influencers with established followings, crypto brands are more likely to help users become influencers.

Fiserova said her company has sold hundreds of thousands of Trezor wallets this way, working with “the community” to create a brand that users love so much the hardware seller “does not need to pay for advertising.”

“We have seen a growing demand for our products in the past three months,” Fiserova said. “There were some shipment issues in some markets, which we managed to resolve, so our customers would get their devices on time.”

Rodolfo Novak, co-founder of the hardware seller Coinkite, said he’s also seen an uptick in demand since the coronavirus crisis began.

“Our sales are increasing week by week,” Novak said, declining to specify how many devices other than to say it is now comparable to the French wallet startup Ledger, which sold more than 1.8 million wallets to date, according to a Ledger spokesperson. Novak added his company sent more than 50 hardware products to YouTube reviewers over the past three years. In terms of community, the company’s Telegram group has roughly 773 members. This is their primary marketing strategy.

“We find our users help other users,” Novak said. “If we added the cost of education [marketing] that would make our product more expensive.”

Even this small niche has proved profitable for Coinkite, which operates its own factory and DTC distribution. In the beauty industry, DTC startups are often acquired by larger brands or start more traditional ad campaigns as they grow. When it comes to crypto, so far it appears larger companies rely on sponsoring niche content creators. Because, after all, free products don’t pay the bills.

Sponsorships and referrals

The most successful crypto influencers generally seek to spin their star power into media startups.

This may someday be the case for bitcoin podcaster Marty Bent, whose show is sponsored by Unchained Capital and Square’s Cash App. For now, Bent described his podcast and newsletter as an educational “passion project,” in addition to working at the bitcoin company Great American Mining. Bent said he rejects several prospective advertisers a month because he’s not in a rush to build a sustainable podcast business.

“I wouldn’t be against advertising for a company that isn’t a bitcoin company, as long as I like and believe in the product,” Bent said. “I think content creators, especially if they’re successful in developing an engaged audience, should realize they can be selective and wait for advertisers they and their audiences align with.”

A spokesperson for Cash App declined to comment on the company’s sponsorship strategy, including deals with podcaster Joe Rogan and the Twitter-savvy rapper Lil B. Large companies, like Cash App and the Kraken crypto exchange, focus on sponsoring content creators that monetize their personal brands.

Kraken sponsors two such startups that emerged over the past year, including Reckless VR in April 2020, founded by virtual reality meetup organizer Udi Wertheimer, and podcaster Peter McCormack, who launched his media brand Defiance in 2019. McCormack is one of the few influencers who turned his hobby into a day job, reportedly earning $1 million in revenue last year.

Still, micro-influencers make money through referrals rather than sponsorships. Bent is an unusual case, snagging a mainstream sponsor so early on.

For a more typical example, Michael Gu, who created a Telegram group with more than 3,602 members and a YouTube channel with 203,000 subscribers, said he offers Ledger wallet affiliate links although the hardware company doesn’t sponsor his videos. Since Gu started creating crypto content in 2012 under the Boxmining moniker, he primarily monetizes his social media channels through affiliate links, viewer donations and, until recently, monthly YouTube memberships.

“I don’t view Boxmining as a business that demands monthly profits etc.,” Gu said of his crypto content brand. “We had an increase in donations after coronavirus, especially after the community found out that YouTube demonetized all videos covering the subject.”

Growth strategies

The first lesson crypto brands are learning from their beauty industry predecessors is that influencers must be hyper-specific to drive sales, yet evolve as the audience grows in order to remain relevant.

Companies like the payments startup and debit card provider Crypto.com may leverage their influencer strategies to spin out regional communities, such as Turkish or Russian Telegram groups.

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said his company already started this process during the demand surge of early 2020, and is now looking for local partners “from universities, to influencers, to payment partners.” Meanwhile, he said the startup’s user base doubled to 2 million people over the past six months.

When it comes to what the company looks for in an influencer, Marszalek said people willing to broadcast themselves “using our product and testing it, introducing it to their audiences.”

“We get more return on investment on that [giveaways and referral bonuses] than Facebook ads,” Marszalek said. “The drop-offs are huge once you ask for know-your-customer information, so it’s an expensive thing to advertise if you don’t have an attractive product with a strong word-of-mouth [reputation].”

It’s clear how crypto companies benefit from focusing their marketing budgets on influencers and community management instead of ads and traditional media coverage. It remains to be seen how this plays into the broader influencer economy.

In the beauty industry, the most successful influencers eventually launch their own product lines. This is much closer to the type of personality cult and product pairing seen with token issuers like Justin Sun of Tron or Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, creator of BNB tokens, than influencer media startups like theSkimm. Much like Sun, other types of influencers also occasionally do cash giveaways for fans on social media. This isn’t unique to crypto.

Will we someday live in a world where fans speculate on a celebrity’s earning potential, like NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie is doing with security tokens?

It’s still exceedingly rare for influencer clout to build a broader media or education business, in any sector, rather than advertise consumable products. The YouTube Queen herself, Michelle Phan, is looking to launch a podcast in 2020 and become an exception to this rule.

In a space where most people get information about financial products through sponsored content, it’s up to consumers to determine whether the influencer is offering unbiased education or propaganda.

Sometimes, marketing can be both. Tron founder Justin Sun sponsored a college campus tour by podcaster Ben Armstrong, aka BitBoy Crypto, in 2019, along with partners at the Blockchain Education Alliance. As for Bent, he’s not aiming to make “a ton of money,” any time soon, nor expand like McCormack.

Since Bent has traditional syndicate experience, from the podcast network Barstool Sports, he isn’t betting on that rare transition from sponsored educator to sustainable outlet.",2020-06-01 10:00:00+00:00,,,

The sell-off began at 14:45 UTC (10:45 a.m. ET) when the cryptocurrency was trading at highs above $10,137 and by 14:49 UTC, the price fell to $9,298. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,500, representing a 6.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. On BitMEX, prices were as low as $8,600.

The sudden price drop may have trapped many traders on the wrong side of the market. Moreover, the market was looking strong following Monday’s convincing move above $10,000, and a few analysts were expecting bitcoin to continue rising toward $11,000.

However, buyers once again failed to keep prices above the $10,000 mark. The cryptocurrency has struggled multiple times over the past 12 months or so to establish a strong base above $10,000. The retreat, however, is unlikely to deter investors, who believe in bitcoin’s long-term value as a safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation.

Moreover, “HODLing” sentiment has remained strong despite the unprecedented price volatility seen in the past five months. Nearly 60% of bitcoin’s supply hasn’t changed hands in over a year, a likely sign investors are holding in expectation of gains, according to Glassnode.

The latest sell-off, however, is weighing on alternative cryptocurrencies. At press time, litecoin is down 5%, while Ethereum’s ether token is reporting a 6% daily loss. Other major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV, and XRP are also flashing red.

Meanwhile, traditional markets are seeing mixed action. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.4%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is losing 0.5% of its value. Major European equity indices like Germany’s DAX and U.K. FTSE are up 3% and 1%, respectively.",2020-06-02 15:59:17+00:00,https://inc42.com/buzz/indian-cryptocurrency-market-to-witness-increase-in-new-users-more/,"According to cryptocurrency research platform Coinpaprika and global crypto exchange OKEx, India is poised to gain considerable global market share of crypto transactions this year.

The report published last week showcased that the trading volume of Indian crypto exchange platforms, CoinDCX and WazirX, witnessed an increase in the trading volume since the ease of cryptocurrency trade policy in the country. As per Similarweb, the website traffic of major crypto exchanges from India has increased during 2020 Q1.

Furthermore, the report revealed that OKEx’s visits from India saw the highest increase, reaching 545.56%. It claimed that newly registered users from India rose by 4100% during the same period. The global crypto exchange platform is now eyeing India and has plans to launch P2P trading platform in the country soon, which will allow Indian users to buy Bitcoins, Etherium and other digital currencies with INR via multiple payment channels.

Previously, another global crypto exchange platform Kraken had also announced that it will be expanding to the Indian market this year. With this, the crypto market in India is expected to get fierce in the coming months.

However, the crypto market still faces challenges in terms of lack of clear regulatory policies, including tax obligations. Also, there is no clarity in terms of how cryptocurrency can be used for cross-border transactions or for conversion into more stable currencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium. More than anything, the market is influenced by political factors, and any fluctuation or move towards a decentralised market, Bitcoin may no longer be necessary for Indians.

At the same time, as a utility token, the demand for Bitcoin has significantly increased in countries where the fiat currency has depreciated in value.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of writing was $10,103.5, with a market cap of $185 Bn, compared to last week (May 26, 2020) which stood at $8,821.92, with a market cap of $162 Bn. Interestingly, Bitcoin on Monday (June 1) the price increased by almost $1,000 in less than 12 hours.

Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, was priced at $247, with a market cap of $27 Bn at the time of writing, compared to last week (May 26, 2020), where the price of the cryptocurrency was $202, with a market cap of $22 Bn.

The former is a cryptocurrency research platform while the latter is a global crypto exchange. They analyzed the Indian crypto sector, major players, the challenges they face, and the rapid development of the country’s crypto ecosystem, Bitcoin.com reported.

“India is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets, gradually catching up on cryptocurrency development,” the two companies wrote, elaborating: “We attribute the driving force of the Indian cryptocurrency market development to three significant factors, namely immigrants, finance, and government policies … It is expected that the global market share of crypto transactions in the Indian market will increase significantly in 2020-2022.”

Key Factors

The report attributes the rapid growth of the Indian crypto industry to three key factors. The first is cross-border remittances. “The amount of remittances by Indian immigrants has been the highest in the world over the years,” the report says, citing the fact that the country had more than 17 million people emigrate in 2019. Since cross-border transactions traditionally carry high fees, Coinpaprika and Okex believe that “Using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a cross-border payment medium, Indians can save a large number of remittance fees.”

The report adds, “Cryptocurrency as a cross-border payment medium will make a big difference in the Indian market. Due to great remittance demand, it will drive the prosperity of digital currency growth in India for a long time.”

Trading volumes on peer-to-peer crypto platforms Localbitcoins and Paxful have been growing steadily in India. Many Indians convert their INR to bitcoin and then to US. dollars using these two platforms.

The next factor concerns the instability of the Indian rupee and Indians’ strong demand for US dollars, the report outlines. “The value of Indian rupee is not stable, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic … The exchange rate between the rupee and USD continued to rise, causing the former to enter constant depreciation … with the constant depreciation of the rupee, the Indians have a strong need to convert their rupee into a more stable fiat currency,” the report says.

“However, due to strict foreign exchange regulations, it is complicated to convert rupee directly to US dollars. Therefore, most Indians will choose to convert rupee to bitcoin and then to US dollars through C2C trading platforms such as Localbitcoins and Paxful.”

The report continues, “Many rupees are exchanged to bitcoin through chat groups, such as Whatsapp, Telegram, and Facebook, which are then converted into US dollars. To maintain their asset’s value, cryptocurrency is being used as a vehicle to convert rupees into more stable fiat currency in India.”

The third factor is the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency in India. In March, the country’s Supreme Court quashed the banking restriction imposed by the central bank, which has had profound effects on the local crypto industry. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently confirmed in a reply to a right to information (RTI) request that there is no longer any banking ban on crypto exchanges, companies, or traders.

“After the policy was loosened, the increase in trading volume was not only reflected in local exchanges, but also the major global exchanges,” the report continues. According to Similarweb, a website analytics data provider, traffic on major crypto exchanges from India increased many-fold in Q1 2020. The report further highlights: “Okex’s visits from India saw the highest increase, reaching 545.56%.” According to Okex, newly registered users from India rose 4,100% during the same period.

Besides Okex, several other crypto exchanges have reported huge growth in trading volumes and new users. For example, two prominent local exchanges, Wazirx and Unocoin, independently told Bitcoin.com that they experienced 10X volume growth as Indians explored crypto trading during the extended nationwide lockdown. Moreover, new crypto exchanges are launching in India, global exchanges are expanding in the country, and more venture capitalists are investing in Indian crypto startups.

Okex is preparing to launch a P2P trading platform in India where a number of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BTC) and tether (USDT), can be traded against the Indian rupee via several payment channels. Kraken also said it plans to expand into India this year.

“The competition between local and global major crypto exchanges in the Indian market will become increasingly fierce,” the report concludes. “Exchanges are expected to steer their focus on enhancing the stability of their derivatives products and offering more diverse depositing channels for users.”

As for the entire Indian economy, Goldman Sachs’ strategists have predicted that the country’s recession will be its worst ever.",2020-06-02 10:05:20+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-crime-idUSKBN2391N2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crypto intelligence company CipherTrace, which started tracking cryptocurrency crime a few years ago, said it has started to see coronavirus-related frauds that require some form of digital currency payment.

Losses from cryptocurrency thefts, hacks, and frauds soared to nearly $1.4 billion from the beginning of the year until the end of May, a report from CipherTrace showed.

The proportion traced to coronavirus fraud involving cryptocurrencies for the first five months of the year was minimal, CipherTrace said, but it did not give a specific figure.

This year’s crypto crime is on track to be the second largest on record after last year’s $4.5 billion in losses.

“Consumers, investors, and users continue to adopt cryptocurrency at a massive rate and it is by far the fastest-growing payment system on the planet,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace chief executive officer, told Reuters.

“At one trillion dollars in annual payments, cryptocurrency payments have grown from zero to 7% in 10 years, making this volume of funds attractive to bad actors,” he added.

Coronavirus-inspired fraud generally took place by luring victims off legitimate platforms into chat rooms where payment in bitcoin can be requested, CipherTrace said in the report.

COVID-19 fraud has also taken the form of impersonating legitimate entities such as The Red Cross to extract personal information and payment in cryptocurrencies, applications that claim to support victims but are actually spying on users, as well as the sale of bogus personal protective equipment, supposed treatments, and testing kits.

Though the majority of COVID-19-related products advertised on darknet markets did not result in many sales, these markets sold coronavirus phishing kits quite successfully, CipherTrace said.

The largest contributor to crypto losses this year was the $1 billion Ponzi scheme by Wotoken in China, the extent of which came out last month in a criminal trial, according to the CipherTrace report.

The Wotoken scheme offered investors the chance to generate returns for users by employing algorithmic trading bots, offering referral commissions to affiliates, news reports said. However, the advertised proprietary trading software did not exist.

The CipherTrace report also released findings showing that for the third year in row, Finnish exchanges in 2019 received the highest number of bitcoins that were supposed to have come from criminal sources. Some 12.01% of tainted bitcoins went through their trading platforms last year.",2020-06-02 12:21:20+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-traders-whack-the-beehive-as-bitcoin-surges-then-plunges,"Tuesday’s bitcoin price whipsaw can be partially explained by large traders looking to deleverage in the derivatives market.

Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $9,512 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping less than 1% over the previous 24 hours.

A sudden rally to $10,000 late Monday boosted bullish sentiment as short sellers were squeezed on derivatives exchange BitMEX, the largest such event in eight months. Bitcoin traded as high as $10,430 on Coinbase. However, the market lost steam and bitcoin was then confined to a tight $10,000-$10,100 range for around 12 hours. Then, at 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) Tuesday, it suffered a drop of 8%, or $800, in less than five minutes.

“Today’s action is very fickle,” said Katie Stockton of Fairfield Strategies. Stockton still sees bullish momentum and expects bitcoin to approach highs not seen since last year. “Specifically, $10,055 is a retracement level that is the last major hurdle to the high from 2019 near $13,850,” she added.

Bitcoin’s sudden rise then fall was in part driven by liquidations on Seychelles-based derivatives exchange BitMEX. Over the past 24 hours, buy liquidations on BitMEX jumped during bitcoin’s price rise, then sell liquidations surged as the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dipped. Total buy liquidations over the past 24 hours were $131 million while sell liquidations were at $111 million.

Liquidations on BitMEX are the equivalent of margin calls on conventional exchanges. A “buy liquidation” on a bitcoin contract is when a losing short position is forced to close, requiring purchases of bitcoin. When a “sell liquidation” occurs, those long bitcoin are forced to sell.

Clayton suspects large spot traders are looking to liquidate BitMEX perpetual swaps that enable highly leveraged bets, up to 100x, on bitcoin’s price going up or down. “Big traders are looking for stops or perpetual liquidations,” he told CoinDesk.

In all, $242 million in liquidations occurred over the last 24 hours, over 70% of the $339 million in total BitMEX liquidations for the past week.

Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, is concerned about massive amounts of leverage looming in crypto. However, he told CoinDesk, the recent bitcoin price moves still have futures in “contango’” a market condition considered bullish as futures are traded higher than spot prices. “Even after the roundtrip, we retain a contango in the curve,” he said.

Cryptanalysis Capital’s Clayton also concurs with Shah that the market remains optimistic on higher bitcoin prices, despite this speed bump.

“The macro environment is still incredibly bullish for bitcoin and the wider crypto market,” Clayton told CoinDesk.

Crypto Briefs is your daily, bite-sized digest of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related news – investigating the stories flying under the radar of today’s crypto news.

Blockchain news

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin said that the initial deployment of Ethereum's layer 2 scaling strategy has ""basically"" succeeded, and what now remains to be done are refinement and deployment. He added that this is an adoption challenge, not a technical challenge, as users need to have plasma- or rollup-based wallets, and also that token transfers must continue moving to layer 2 solutions given that they take up a large part of network activity. Buterin also shared a Twitter thread by blockchain developer with Horizon Games , Philippe Castonguay, who listed a number of layer 2 scaling projects that went/will go live within a month.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) performed its scheduled Phoenix hard fork, thus including Ethereum's Istanbul fork features into its own chain, states the announcement. With this upgrade, the two protocols reportedly became fully compatible with each other.

Mining news

Major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool Poolin said it has began working with US-based crypto lender BlockFi , ""which will probably be appearing like an interbank lender,"" offering a supply of capital for Poolin. The agency initially rolled out crypto lending choices in February through its Singapore-registered pockets entity, Blockin . The pool said that with extra capital they will have the ability to lengthen the enterprise to extra miner prospects, providing annualized curiosity at ranges that may be under 6%.

SMIC wants to use the funds to develop new 14nm chips that will be used in mining rigs.

Adoption news

Private Swiss bank Maerki Baumann has launched a new crypto premium trading and custody service, for which they had received a licence from the Swiss Financial Market Advisory Authority (FINMA). According to the announcement, the bank will start with BTC, BCH, XRP, LTC, and ETH, and gradually expand its list of supported assets. This is another step in a multi-stage crypto strategy that begun in early 2019, while the bank will be working on the expansion of its existing private banking offering in the second half of the year, and building up selected crypto investment services.

Over 55 institutions and 26 exchanges are already active on the network, the company said.

Regulation news

The head of the Russian parliament’s financial committee Anatoly Aksakov has made further comments on Russia’s forthcoming cryptoasset bill, per the Duma’s Parliamentary Gazette. Aksakov says there is still space for discussion, with a consultation period coming in “two weeks’ time,” before parliamentarians are asked to vote on the bills. However, despite outcry at the prospect of a China-style crypto crackdown, Aksakov stated that only “professional participants should make use of [cryptocurrencies]. He added, “if non-professional investors are allowed to use [to participate], then they must do so with certain restrictions.”

Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has justified its x2 leverage cap for crypto exchanges, imposed early last month with a six-month grace period. Per media outlet Coin Post, in response to a challenge from a Japanese MP, an FSA executive stated that the decision had been made in conjunction with a “study group” comprising a number of leading Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges, and had received approval from the Japanese cabinet.

Exchanges news

Bitfinex has integrated Tether (USDT) into the OMG Network, a platform that enables peer-to-peer transactions in real-time by scaling the Ethereum network. According to the press release, this will reduce confirmation times, make payments faster, and lowers transaction costs.

Crime news",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-pool-poolin-blockfi-crypto-lending,"Poolin, the second-largest bitcoin mining pool, is expanding its cryptocurrency lending and financial services businesses.

The pool announced Monday it has started working with U.S.-based crypto lender BlockFi, which will be acting like an interbank lender, providing a source of capital for Poolin.

The firm initially rolled out crypto lending offerings in February via its Singapore-registered wallet entity, Blockin. With more capital now available, Poolin will be able to extend the business to more miner customers, offering annualized interest at levels that can be below 6%.

Miners that connect to the pool currently have about 18.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) of combined computing power, accounting for roughly 20% of the Bitcoin network’s total. That makes PoolIn the second-largest bitcoin mining pool, close behind F2Pool with around 19 EH/s of hashing power.

“[A] mining pool is a traffic business and it is getting more and more competitive,” said Yang Jianguo, head of Poolin’s financial services. “Poolin has its unique advantage but we also want multiple business lines – not just lending but also financial services – that are parallel to our pool business.”

Toward that end, the firm developed and launched its custodial Blockin wallet late last year. Poolin is the latest major bitcoin mining pool to have expanded into crypto lending products, despite a drop in demand after the major sell-off in March which force-liquidated the bitcoin collateral of many crypto miner operators in China.

Yang said, though, there is still demand from miners for loans originating from the need to pay for electricity or buying new mining equipment with bitcoin pledged as collateral. There’s also a demand for options and derivative products.

The firm declined to disclose the current value of outstanding loans or how much it is borrowing from BlockFi.

The partnership also comes as BlockFi moves to extend credit to miners, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

Poolin said it’s also considering accepting mining equipment as collateral, but acknowledged the valuation of such assets is not as definable as bitcoin.",2020-06-02 09:21:51+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/67134/square-crypto-grants-100k-to-bitcoins-lightning-network-watchtower-the-eye-of-satoshi,"Square Crypto has awarded a new grant to Talaia Labs, which is building bitcoin’s Lightning Network watchtower called The Eye of Satoshi.

The grant amount is $100,000, Talaia Labs CEO Sergi Delgado told The Block. He added that the funds would be used “exclusively for Bitcoin development, with a current focus on the watchtower.”

Watchtowers are third-parties that monitor the bitcoin blockchain for discrepancies between on-chain transactions and closing off-chain channels with invalid states. Square Crypto said The Eye of Satoshi monitors blockchain transactions “to protect you from peers closing the channel and taking your coins.”

It went on to say that Talaia also ""improves censorship resistance by making certain attacks harder,” and that it will integrate with several Lightning Network implementations.

Notably, Square Crypto recently unveiled its own Lightning Development Kit — to help developers integrate the Lightning Network with their bitcoin wallet applications.

The latest grant marks Square Crypto’s sixth grant. The firm has previously offered donations to bitcoin developers Jon Atack and Tankred Hase, pseudonymous bitcoin Lightning Network developer “ZmnSCPxj” and the BTCPay Foundation.",

Long time trader John Bollinger has warned that bitcoin’s flash rally to over $10,400 on Monday was fake, adding that losses might be on the way.

“This is a Head Fake at the upper Bollinger Band for $btcusd,” tweeted Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands indicator.

A ‘head-fake’ trade happens when an asset price makes a move in one direction, but then reverses course and moves in the opposite direction, according to the know-it-all online dictionary Investopedia.

Bollinger Bands define high and low on a relative basis. By definition prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band.

John Bollinger urged investors to trade with caution or to sell bitcoin (BTC) altogether. He sated: “time to be cautious or short.”

Bitcoin rallied past $10,400 on June 1 in a brief breakout, possibly spurred by runaway coronavirus spending by governments throughout the world.

The dramatic swing may have reflected renewed investor optimism towards a bull run in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent third halving, but faded just as quickly as it started.

Some 24 hours later, the price of BTC plunged 17% in a matter of minutes to as low as $8,600 on Bitmex – a flash crash some observers attribute to manipulation by the so-called whales.

Bollinger’s analysis adds to a chorus of voices that have called out BTC’s impromptu rally as a false signal – at least in the short-term.

Bitmex co-founder and chief executive officer Arthur Hayes suggests that this week’s breakout was a bull trap and that bitcoin will have to rise by nearly 60% from its current price of about $9,400 before reclaiming the bulls.

“The basis is starting to get juicy. It sure beats earning 0% at the bank… But this rally ain’t real until we take out $15k,” Hayes said in a tweet.

Bitcoin has twice tried to breach $10,000 in the past two weeks, succeeding twice, but both the breakouts never lasted, as strong resistance set-in. Traders consider $10,000 a key level for a bullish upswing.

Peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading data shows digital assets like bitcoin are growing extremely popular in Russia, despite the State Duma’s opinions and regulations aimed at crypto assets. On Monday, the Russian government published a draft version of litigation mandates called “On Digital Financial Assets,” and lawmakers are looking for public opinion. Despite the strict proposal drafted by the Russian bureaucracy, trade volumes on certain exchanges have seen significant demand from the country’s citizens.

Russia’s Cryptocurrency Laws Remain in the Gray Zone

Just recently Russia’s State Duma released a draft of proposed litigation toward cryptocurrencies and companies that deal with the technology. The draft called “On Digital Financial Assets,” is an updated version on how lawmakers might regulate the crypto industry in the near future. The documents do not delve much into personal holdings, trading, and cross-border remittances, unless it is applied to startups and veteran companies that leverage cryptocurrencies. People can own bitcoin or other digital assets, but the new proposal does prohibit the widespread circulation and even evangelism when it comes to digital currencies versus the Russian ruble.

“Сryptocurrencies go completely into the gray zone in Russia,” explains Waves Enterprise representative Artem Kalikhov. “People who own one or two bitcoins are not at risk. But all cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets hosted on Russian sites with a .ru at the end are now at risk.”

Demand for Cryptos Like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Has Been Thriving in Russia

Despite the newly updated proposal, Russian trade volume for bitcoin (BTC) on the peer-to-peer trading platform Localbitcoins (LBC) has been surging. For two months straight Russia has outpaced a number of other countries who have also been seeing significant trade volumes stem from the Russian people. Coin Dance statistics indicate that Russia has accounted for 20% of May’s LBC trade volume. Even though regulatory clarity has kept Russians in the dark, LBC’s data shows that citizens from the region are demanding more bitcoin than they have in years.

Data from Bitcoin.com’s local bitcoin cash (BCH) marketplace, Local.Bitcoin.com, indicates that Russians are trading a lot of BCH as well. In popular regions like Venezuela and Colombia, there are people who have traded 50 to over 100 times using Local.Bitcoin.com. In Russia, however, traders have settled over a thousand buys and sells in the local region. People accept credit cards, Advcash, Qiwi, and bank transfers. One trader from Russia shows that he/she has settled over 15,000 trades in the country purchasing bitcoin cash.

Russia was recently featured in an Onfo research report, which had shown the country saw a faster network effect than the likes of the U.S. and Germany. The trend of adoption continues despite Russian lawmakers proposing a law that will allegedly criminalize buying bitcoin with cash.

News.Bitcoin.com’s Jeff Gogo reported on how offenders from Russia could face seven years in jail if the law is enacted. While the Russian government seems like it will crack down on bitcoin, there have been rumors of the country banning digital assets for over seven years now. Even though, Russian residents are still in the “gray zone,” like Artem Kalikhov stressed, the demand for cryptocurrencies continues to thrive.

Blockchain technology has so far been successful in disrupting industries across the board, penetrating into everything from supply chains to traditional finance. Riding on the popularity and effectiveness of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies have also seen a more legitimate ecosystem created around them.

Cryptocurrency lending has been one of the fastest-growing segments of the blockchain industry, with even institutional investors showing a significant interest in the service. However, individuals with fewer resources than institutions often find it hard to keep up with the increasingly maturing market and sift through the growing competition.

These companies make money by providing collateral-backed loans to users, where they take the crypto deposits and lend them out to various hedge funds and exchanges. These borrowers have to provide collateral equal to 100 percent of their loan in either crypto or cash while paying interest of 15 percent or more.

Those holding Bitcoin that want to take a portion of the profits made by the loan companies can give their coins to them for a return of anywhere between 3 and 8 percent per year.

In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most popular and most promising cryptocurrency lending platforms to help users navigate the growing, complex market.

Cred is a global financial services platform based in the San Francisco Bay Area that services customers in 196 countries. Founded in 2018 by former PayPal executives Dan Schatt and Lu Hua, the lending platform aims to harness the power of blockchain to provide low-cost credit products to everyone.

The company’s vision is backed by some of the largest names in crypto venture capital, such as Arrington XRP Capital, BlockTower Capital, FBG Capital, and Binance Labs.

The company also offers tailored services to fit large borrowers and lenders such as institutions or whales, but anyone with an Uphold account can utilize the company’s services.

The unusually large return comes at a small cost. In order to access the 8 percent APY interest rate, users have to stake 10,000 LBA, or around $110 worth of the platform’s native token, the Lend Borrow Asset (LBA). It’s also important to note that while the platform is available in 196 countries worldwide, only 30 U.S. states can access it.

By far the most popular is the basic Cred Earn package, which offers a standard annual percentage yield (APY) of 4 percent. However, those that want to pledge or lend Bitcoin are able to get a preferential rate of 8 percent if they agree to lock-up their coins for a minimum of 6 months.

Created with a goal to compete with the big names in banking, Celsius has set its sight on improving legacy financial infrastructure. Its founders, Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon funded the company through a 2017 ICO that raised $50 million.

Just like Cred, Celsius also has a token native to its platform, called the CEL token. However, unlike Cred, Celsius doesn’t require users to stake their token, but uses it as an incentive—those holding CEL are entitled to receive interest bonuses depending on their loyalty levels if they choose to earn interest in CEL tokens.

Currently, the option to earn interest in CEL tokens is not available in the US.

The platform’s standard interest rate on Bitcoin lending is 4.03 percent, while a preferential rate of 6.2 percent is available to users that are willing to accept their payouts in CEL. There is no minimum lockup time, plus the platform offers bonus interest payouts of up to 35 percent to users willing to keep up to 15 percent of their holdings in CEL.

In addition to that, users who have more than 15 percent of their holdings on Celsius in CEL as platinum members can unlock an effective annual interest rate as high as 8.37 (6.2 + 35 percent) percent on Bitcoin lending.

Celsius is available in all U.S. states, excluding Washington and New York, but the preferential rates paid out in CEL aren’t available anywhere in the U.S.

Founded in 2017 with a mission to become the most trusted financial services provider in crypto, BlockFi is the lending platform that raised the most capital in its ICO. It is also the institution with the largest number of large institutional backers, which some potential users might find reassuring and trustworthy.

The company’s ICO raised an estimated $108 million in 2017, thanks to investments from ConsenSys, Winklevoss Capital, Arrington XRP Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Three Arrows Capital, Susquehanna, SoFi, and Valar.

The fact that it has lower rates than its two previously mentioned competitors is balanced out by its availability—BlockFi is the only cryptocurrency lending service available in all U.S. states. However, only crypto pairs are available in many states.

BlockFi’s annual percentage yield (APY) on Bitcoin is 3.2 percent. The platform’s preferential rate of 6 percent is available for the first five BTC a user holds on the service. There is no minimum required lockup time for lending.

BlockFi also offers an 8.6 percent interest rate on USDC and Gemini dollars.

One of the oldest platforms that enables crypto lending, Crypto.com has been around since 2016, when Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek, and Rafael Melo founded the company that enables users to earn, trade, borrow, and pay in crypto.

The all-encompassing range of financial services the company wanted to provide attracted investments from various accredited and non-accredited investors, enabling it to raise $26.7 million in its 2017 ICO. The Hong Kong-based company quickly began making strides in the crypto industry by offering a prepaid crypto Visa card.

Crypto.com users can access fairly good interest rates through the platform’s mobile app—the company’s Earn program offers a 4.58 percent APY on Bitcoin. Those that hold the platform’s native cryptocurrency, the MCO token, are eligible for a preferential rate of 6.66 percent.

Aside from the regular Earn program, the company also offers Crypto.com Private, where high-net investors can earn an additional 2 percent bonus interest, which effectively means they can access an annual interest rate of 8.77 percent on Bitcoin.

The higher interest rates, however, do require a three-month lockup, while lower interest rates are available without any lockup terms.

There is also the issue of limited access, as users that want to earn the higher interest rates have to buy and stake 500 MCO, worth around $2,700 at press time. But, staking also unlocks the ability to have a crypto debit card with a 3 percent cashback on all purchases. The larger the user’s MCO stake is, the larger the more cash it can get back on the debit card.

Crypto.com also offers an attractive interest rate of 12 percent for stable coins like TrueUSD or Paxos Standard to users staking 500 MCO.

The service is available in select European countries, Singapore, and all U.S. states, excluding New York.

Created in 2017 as a subsidiary of Credissimo, an online lending pioneer that has been serving millions of users in Europe, Nexo was the first company to power instant crypto-backed loans. The company’s 2018 ICO raised $52 million, allowing it to introduce various new services and features such as the Nexo MasterCard credit card.

Nexo is certainly geared more towards borrowers than lenders—the company enables users to use 24 different crypto assets as collateral and get loans both in fiat and in cryptocurrencies. The platform’s interest rate starts from 5.9 percent per year, but requires no minimum prepayment. The minimal amount for a loan is set at $500.

Those that want to earn interest on their holdings can deposit fiat currencies such as the USD, EUR, or GBP, or stablecoins such as USDT, TUSD, USDC, PAX, and DAI. The company provides an 8 percent annual return of 8 percent on both fiat and stablecoins.

Like Crypto.com, Nexo also offers its users the ability to access a prepaid MasterCard debit card. The card can be used with more than 40 million merchants across the globe and comes without transaction fees or currency exchange fees.

The partnership adds to Plutus’ blossoming list of major brand partners, following in the steps of Airbnb and Skyscanner.

Part of the challenger-bank revolution, Plutus’ goal is to bring cryptocurrencies into everyday life. It does this by distinctly fusing both banking and cryptocurrencies within its feature-rich and user-friendly app.

“We recognised the importance of cryptocurrencies early on, and, in particular, honed in on the retail adoption struggles of the nascent asset and payments class,” details Danial Daychopan, founder of Plutus. “The aim was to circumvent the need for retail acceptance by integrating cryptocurrencies with our traditional legacy infrastructures to make them spendable anywhere immediately.”

Plutus enables users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets to the app in a non-custodial way, meaning that the company never has access to users’ private keys. Users’ crypto assets reside side-by-side with GBP and EUR accounts tethered to a VISA Debit Card, and are spendable with more than 61 million merchants worldwide. However, the magic is in the features. Wielding a decentralized exchange (DEX), Plutus Perks, and Plutus Rewards options, users can access a suite of benefits unavailable in the conventional financial system or crypto market.

With Nike situated as a prominent affiliate partner, Plutus users can earn additional rewards on specific products as part of the new partnership.

“You can purchase products such as the Nike Air Max ’90s, customize them using the Nike By You website, and receive up to 9% cash back on top of the 3% crypto back for your purchase, which appears in your Plutus account,” says Minyi Soon, CPO of Plutus.

Rewards are generated in Plutus’ native Pluton (PLU) token, which is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network and the world’s first decentralized loyalty token. Besides some of the explicit rewards benefits with Plutus’ affiliate partners, users can earn larger rewards by staking the PLU token via Plutus’ app.

“Importantly, the PLU tokens are trivially convertible to other crypto tokens or fiat,” says founder Daychopan. “Overcoming some of the obstacles of traditional loyalty programmes also led to us revamping the model entirely — meaning users can redeem the PLU token for Plutus Premium Services, transfer PLU tokens to friends or family, and convert them into their fiat balance for spending.”

This offer is appealing for both crypto and fiat users, and Plutus is looking to build off its strong momentum with the Nike partnership moving into the latter half of 2020.",2020-06-03 10:41:20+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/162256-crypto-rating-council-argues-that-xrp-tron-trx-and-polkadots-dot-token-might-potentially-be-classified-as-securities/,"The(CRC) has previously noted that Tron’s TRX, Nervos’ CKB token, and Polkadot’s DOT token might potentially be classified as financial securities, or at least there’s a fair chance they could.

The CRC’s initial report on these digital assets was released in April 2020, and it’s possible that the organization’s opinion might change.

The CRC is a group of established US-based cryptocurrency-related companies (including Coinbase, Circle, Kraken, Bittrex, Genesis Capital, eToro, OKCoin, Radar, Anchorage, Cumberland, among others) that supports and promotes regulatory clarity in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) space.

The CRC assigns ratings to different crypto-assets based on a framework that was established by the Howey Test.

Earlier this year, Tron, Nervos, and Polkadot received a 3.75 score out of 5.

As explained by the CRC:

“A score of 1 means the Council’s analysis suggests the asset has few or no characteristics consistent with treatment as an investment contract, and therefore not a security under the US federal securities laws.”

They add:

“A score of 5 means the Council’s analysis suggests that an asset has many characteristics strongly consistent with treatment as a security.”

The CRC claims that its ratings are given after its team members review a project’s whitepaper, their social media posts and engagement, and their GitHub contributions.

The Council also reportedly talks to the project’s developers, in order to learn more about their crypto or blockchain-related initiatives.

After reviewing this information, CRC members conduct live meetings to discuss their findings and go on to raise further questions if needed. When council members decide they’ve reviewed all pertinent information, they usually go ahead and release their findings.

The Nervos team claims that its native CKB token is a utility token, and not a security. However, the CRC said that it’s currently assessing the project and its ratings might be revised or maybe changed after reviewing the new information provided by Nervos.

XRP has received a 4.0 rating, while Cosmos, EOS, and Stellar (XLM) received a 3.75 rating.

The Polkadot project developers have not yet distributed their native DOT token, which will reportedly be done at some point later this year.

San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly the only US exchange that supports Tron (TRX) trading.

Nervos trading is supported by Bittrex, however, it doesn’t maintain a presence in the United States.

Interestingly, USD Coin, the world’s second-largest stablecoin from Coinbase and Circle, was ranked at 1.00, which suggests that the token is most likely not a security (according to the CRC). However, there may be a bit of a bias because Coinbase and Circle are members of the CRC.

The CRC also gave major stablecoin Dai (DAI) a score of 1.00.

The Basic Attention Token (BAT), which is an Ethereum-based digital token that’s used to power Brave privacy browser’s blockchain-enabled online advertising network, was given a score of 2.00 by the CRC in April 2020.

The CRC’s reports are not officially endorsed by development teams, regulatory authorities, or other third-party entities. The CRC was launched in 2019 to provide an industry established a system to help determine whether a digital asset may be considered a security or not. Some industry participants have criticized regulators as using enforcement actions to create rules as opposed to publishing bright-line regulations to foster a compliant sector of finance.",2020-06-16 00:00:00,https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/kraken-ciso-nick-percoco-on-the-crypto-exchanges-productive-paranoia-and-the-future-of-protecting-home-networks-video/,"Audio Version



Episode 3 of SOC Quarantine Diaries catches up with veteran security mind Nick Percoco, whose renowned career has seen him go from pen tester to research lab founder to CISO of two companies

As the current security chief for popular digital currency exchange Kraken, Percoco is not only confronting the unique challenges of safeguarding a crypto platform – several of which have faced devastating breaches in recent years – but also ensuring their millions of customers are protected. That responsibility is especially pronounced when cybercriminals are trying to take advantage of a weary public amid a worldwide pandemic.

In addition to discussing the risks his company and customers face, Percoco shares some thoughts on practicing cybersecurity in the COVID-19 era. While Kraken was left largely unaffected by stay-at-home orders because its employee base was already largely remote, a pervasive security culture within the company helps prepare it to adapt to new variables as they arise.

Ethereum

The most popular way to use bitcoin off-chain is on Ethereum, data suggests. Ethereum projects including WBTC and imBTC hold 70% more bitcoins than Bitcoin-native scaling solutions Lightning or Liquid. Separately, researchers have found that governments and private entities can strip away anonymity from Ethereum, and users are making it easier for them by revealing links between deposits and withdrawals. This could also “impact the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,” the authors write.

Bitcoin

The 20th iteration of Bitcoin Core, the open source software powering the Bitcoin blockchain, was released Wednesday. Included in the update is an experimental software called “Asmap” to protect against a theoretical “Erebus” attack, which allows nation states and/or large internet providers such as AWS to spy, double-spend or censor bitcoin transactions. Meanwhile, HDR Global Trading Limited, BitMEX’s parent company, has awarded its second grant to a Bitcoin Core contributor. (The Block)

Mining

The Bitcoin blockchain adjusted its mining difficulty downwards, dropping 9.29%, to reach the lowest level since January. This is the eighth-largest negative difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin’s history and the eighth instance of two or more consecutive negative adjustments. Elsewhere, mining firm Argo reported a 34% dip in May mining margins, possibly as a result of the bitcoin halving event. Last but certainly not least, Micree Zhan Ketuan, the ousted Bitmain co-founder, sent a letter calling for employees to return to the office to join him rather than his rival co-founder Wu Jihan. The message offered cash bonuses to loyalists, and said Zhan would complete the company’s long-awaited IPO while pushing its market capitalization to over $50 billion in the coming years. Decrypt reported that Zhan retook the office with a dozen security guards in tow.

Bitcoin Doth Protest too Much?

Wall Street traders appear to be looking past the protests roiling across the nation, focusing instead on prospects for an improving economy as states reopen and business activity picks up. The dollar weakened Wednesday against the euro and British pound, seen as a sign that investors in traditional markets are ramping up, not ratcheting back, risk-taking. The bitcoin market, too, has barely reacted to the news. Prices nudged 0.4% higher on Wednesday to about $9,600, leaving the cryptocurrency squarely within the range where it has traded since late April, between $8,500 and $10,200.

Bloomberg Is Bullish

A Bloomberg analyst thinks bitcoin will hit $20,000 this year, after comparing the price action seen over the last 2.5 years to the patterns over the 2.5 years following the leading cryptocurrency’s rise to record highs in December 2013, when bitcoin printed a lifetime high of $1,100 before crashing.

5 Numbers That Tell the Story of Markets Right Now

In this episode of The Breakdown, NLW tries to make sense of today’s economy by looking at the growth of the S&P 500, unemployment statistics and growing global debt.

Who Won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-06-04 16:14:50+00:00,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-bloomberg-expects-double-this-year-cryptocurrency-2020-6-1029281615,"Reuters

Bloomberg expects bitcoin to revisit its record high reached in 2017 and double to $20,000 this year, an analyst note published Tuesday said.

The firm sees bitcoin breaking away from other cryptocurrencies and says the digital currency has increasingly favorable fundamentals and technicals.

Bloomberg says that the same forces pushing gold higher also support bitcoin and that the coronavirus is accelerating bitcoin's maturity relative to the stock market.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Bloomberg is taking the opposite side of Goldman Sachs, saying in a note published on Tuesday that bitcoin could double to $20,000 this year.

Last week, Goldman listed five reasons investors should avoid bitcoin.

The most popular cryptocurrency has so many favorable fundamental and technical factors that ""something needs to go really wrong for bitcoin to not appreciate,"" Bloomberg said.

The company said history indicated that bitcoin should return to $20,000 in 2020, representing roughly double its current levels.

""Bitcoin will approach the record high of about $20,000 this year, in our view, if it follows 2016's trend,"" Bloomberg said.

Bitcoin's maturation, fueled by the growing acceptance of digital currencies, the ability to trade bitcoin futures, and a steady decline in volatility, should keep it tilted toward price appreciation, the research note said.

Additionally, Bloomberg said it expected bitcoin to appreciate if the stock market rolls over.

Technically, bitcoin has solidified the $8,000 level as support and could move higher if it decisively breaks above the $10,000 level — that echoes recent comments from the technical analyst Katie Stockton.

Bloomberg said it thinks bitcoin is benefiting from the coronavirus pandemic, for several reasons.

First, historic declines in equity markets because of the virus didn't spill over to bitcoin, as a brief dip in the cryptocurrency was ""promptly rejected,"" Bloomberg said.

Second, the virus is accelerating the shift away from paper currency toward digital.

And third, new quantitative-easing policies from central banks around the globe are ""helping independent stores-of-value such as gold and bitcoin,"" Bloomberg said.

But Bloomberg's bullish view on bitcoin doesn't translate to other cryptocurrencies like ether.

""We see little upside in the ETH price absent a rising tide from bitcoin,"" Bloomberg said, adding that bitcoin ""is breaking away from the pack in terms of adoption and is supported by almost-ideal macroeconomic conditions for stores-of-value amid quantitative easing.""

Bloomberg joins other influential investors in being bullish on bitcoin, including the hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and the billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya.

Bitcoin traded up 1%, to $9,762, on Wednesday.

NOW WATCH: Tax Day is now July 15 — this is what it's like to do your own taxes for the very first time",2020-06-10 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-users-protocol-privacy,"Ethereum is losing its privacy, warns a new paper, as “careless” users make linking their addresses to real-world identities easy.

With the disquieting title, “Blockchain is Watching You,” the paper – a joint-publication from researchers at the Institute for Computer Science and Control in Hungary, Eötvös Loránd University, Széchenyi István University and HashCloak – argues governments and private-entities are quickly learning how to strip away anonymity from Ethereum. And that’s in part because users are making it easy for them.

“Careless usage easily reveals links between deposits and withdraws and also impact the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,” the authors write.

The researchers argue that Ethereum’s account-based model makes it more susceptible to surveillance than some other protocols, such as Bitcoin.

“The lack of financial privacy is detrimental to most cryptocurrency use cases,” they continue. “We do believe if users were using the technology in a sound way or a privacy-focused wallet software would have helped them and abstracted away potential privacy leaks.”

This concern isn’t new: news organization Decrypt identified a number of Ethereum users by connecting addresses to personal information, citing user actions as being partly to blame.

Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, the Ethereum protocol keeps track of a user’s ether. Rather than effectively creating a new address for each payment (as with Bitcoin), Ethereum records what a user has sent out, say, 1 ETH, but still has 10 ETH, remaining.

A good analogy is Bitcoin is like physical cash in a leather-wallet, with a balance being the amount of unspent cash. Meanwhile, Ethereum is more like a bank account, where a bank, or in this case protocol, knows how much money the account holder has and updates it accordingly.

While this difference has often been glossed over, the paper’s authors argue that a dearth of understanding of the ramifications of Ethereum’s account-based model has left many users, unknowingly, wide-open to the possibility of full-scale surveillance.

Third parties know when an account is most active, allowing them to determine the time-of-day and infer a user’s timezone. Another one is gas-prices. Most users rarely change their gas-price settings, instead of leaving it on the default settings. What this means is that accounts with adjusted gas prices become very easily identifiable and can be tracked across the protocol.

The report also highlights that Ethereum’s account-based model makes it possible for hackers to perform Danaan-style attacks – where they send a user a very specific amount of ether and use that as a “fingerprint,” again to track them around the protocol.

Of course, the researchers argue, it is easy to stop the surveillance. All Ethereum users need to do is use their accounts a couple of times and make sure they don’t put any identifiable information, such as their addresses, on any public forum.

But, if anything, Ethereum users seem to be doing the exact opposite.

Rather than discarding accounts, many users are in fact customizing them, using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to add human-readable names, which makes it even easier to identify a user on the blockchain.

Not only that, but many users publicize their ENS names on their social media profiles, in particular Twitter – which gives third-party surveillance everything they need on a platter. Researchers said they were able to connect 890 Ethereum accounts to real people, just by searching for them on Twitter.

“We observed that the publicly revealed ENS names already expose sensitive activities such as gambling and adult services,” the report reads. “Therefore, users should avoid sensitive activities on addresses easily linkable to their public identities, such as ENS name or their Twitter handle.”

There are also freely available resources online that can help tack identities to Ethereum addresses. The Humanity DAO, for example, acts like an address book, giving third parties access to an immutable registry of real names and Ethereum addresses.

Bad luck if you’ve already registered.

In the end, researchers were able to use the Ethereum block explorer, to link more than 1.1 million transactions to over 4,200 addresses, where they knew the real people. “[C]areless usage easily reveals links between deposits and withdraws and also impacts the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,” they said.

But are Ethereum users entirely to blame? Considering the speed of innovation in blockchain technology, Hudson Jameson, one of Ethereum’s main developer liaisons, says “it’s not fair to put all of the onus on Ethereum users to know best practices to preserve privacy.”

He reckons more can be done by developers and project teams to create applications that instill best privacy practices in by default. That could already be well underway, he said, with solutions such as Tornado Cash – a private ether mixer – already providing users with a means to break the traceability link and restore financial privacy.

But Jameson argues, education is also very important. More should be done to ensure users understand the rudiments of blockchain privacy, possibly even going so far as to tell them they need to treat their Ethereum account information like they would their bank accounts.

He isn’t the only one. Ethereum lead Peter Szilagyi highlighted there should be more done to ensure users remain aware of the vulnerabilities inherent in an account-based model. “We can’t expect people to be aware of every single sensitivity in all the layers,” he tweeted. “Anything we can fix, we must fix.”

Ethereum isn’t the only account-based model – TRON and EOS use the same system too. But Ethereum is the largest and, arguably, the most active smart contract platform around.

The report points out there isn’t much time as the vultures may already be circling: “state-sponsored companies and other entities like Chainalysis are already “performing large-scale deanonymization tasks on cryptocurrency users.”",2020-06-04 09:08:13+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-black-america-economic-justice-author-isaiah-jackson,"Last week, Minneapolis police officers killed a 46-year-old Black man accused of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Ongoing protests have erupted across the country, condemning police brutality and systemic racism.

Part of this conversation – taking place on the streets, over the airwaves and in people’s homes – is that economic inequality is what separates Black Americans from the rest of the nation. In Minneapolis, for example, the median income for Black households is $38,200, less than half of their White counterparts.

Like everywhere else, the protests are also a divisive issue in the crypto ecosystem. There is, however, a general agreement that there are no easy technological solutions to the larger problems plaguing the nation.

While naive claims that “Bitcoin Fixes This” are outwardly derided, Isaiah Jackson’s book title “Bitcoin & Black America” is gaining traction. The mantra, painted on signs seen in Raleigh, N.C., and across Twitter feeds, promises nothing but contains a kernel of insight.

Jackson, founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and the author of Bitcoin & Black America, thinks that bitcoin can play a crucial role in addressing economic disparity in Black communities.

CoinDesk sat down with Jackson to get his take on this week’s protests and what role bitcoin can play in bettering Black lives.

What do you think sparked the massive protests happening across the country?

The protests we’re seeing now were sparked by police violence, but the undertone – a lot of the anger that people are expressing – is economic in nature.

There are 40 million people unemployed, you have people sitting at home angry that the economy they helped build can no longer support them. Some of them received this bullshit $1,200 check, but most of the stimulus was given right back to the millionaires.

The economic injustice that we have today is the result of history. Take redlining, for example, most people don’t understand that generational wealth is accrued through homeownership. Being able to purchase a home in a community that increases in property value over time has given other communities the ability to gain that value without having to do much.

The ability to buy a home, pay off your mortgage and enrich future generations wasn’t available to the Black community [because of redlining]. Black people were excluded from receiving home loans, and when they did, were offered extortionary rates and relegated to neighborhoods that could never really gain in property value – by design.

If you look at where major highways are built and where the exit ramps are located, you’ll notice it’s mostly in Black areas. This destroyed the property value in Black neighborhoods that were already built. In North Carolina, where I’m from, there was an investigation into why I-85 runs along predominantly Black counties. All of this comes out of historical injustices that are still propagated today.

How exactly can bitcoin benefit Black lives?

Police violence is terrible, and it’s not something that could just be solved with bitcoin. But some of these solutions that I’ve seen that can work for the Black community are rooted in group economics.

Living in Los Angeles, I’ve learned from places like Koreatown, Chinatown and smaller communities like Little Ethiopia that understand how group economics works, that the ability to circulate dollars in a community enriches everyone and makes them inherently self-sufficient. Bitcoin offers a similar dynamic.

If you look at the Black church, compared to the catholic church that has billions of dollars in gold and real estate, the Black church lacks tangible long-term assets. Over 80% of the Black community attends some form of group service. If the church begins accepting bitcoin donations as a 501(c)(3) and stores it, that could help support the community in the long term. You can’t stop Bitcoin.

Are there political solutions to bolster civil liberties?

If we actually had a democratic system, where one person equals one vote, we would see a huge difference. Unfortunately, at the national level, there’s the electoral college where states have the authority to overturn the voters’ will.

I’d like to see that repealed. Right now, voting is really just the suggestion of democracy, no one is really electing their leaders. At the local level, I think we need to get money out of politics, where mid-level politicians can co-opt the vote. Fundraising should be standardized, and everyone should only be allowed to give the same amount. That’s where blockchain can be effective, to be able to track how much and where money is coming from, without manipulation.

There are some interesting blockchain projects that allow decentralized communities to foment. Most of these projects are still very early, so the liquidity isn’t there for them to be as effective as bitcoin has. But you have projects based on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, like smart-contract-based voting that could improve local politics.

I believe that blockchain itself isn’t hot sauce, as my friend says, you can’t put it on everything, However, I do think there will be technological solutions to help Black communities.

You’ve mentioned before that the real way to help Black communities is by voting with their dollars. Could you break that down?

From a numbers standpoint, most of the wealth in this country is stored in corporate investments. One of the things I write in the book is that 99% of venture capital flows into other communities, while only 1% goes towards Black founders.

You don’t have to give your money to Black people, I’m not asking for donations, but at least look at Black businesses and shop with Black businesses every now and then. Most are passed by or haven’t built trust with people from other communities. In my own experience, being in the fintech sector, I’ve been questioned plenty of times about my knowledge of finance.

You have to realize that Black people are just as viable in every business sector. In short, if you want to help: shop with Black businesses. That’s what will help build a strong middle class. And, of course, speak out if you see something.

Andreessen Horowitz announced a $2.2 million fund Wednesday dedicated to funding underrepresented founders. Last month it raised $515 million for a second crypto fund. Does this demonstrate the misplaced priorities of the financial sector?

I think most of these companies are just realizing now that they want to give to Black tech founders. It’s better late than never. At the very least you are doing something.

There’s a lot of wealth created through venture capital, which can support the creation of businesses for the long term, so that investment is needed. $2.2 million is a start, and once we prove ourselves with companies that actually work, we can go from there. Money talks and bullshit walks.

How do you make sense of the violence that has erupted during the George Floyd protests?

In terms of the violence going on, it’s clear it’s not just Black protestors, there are some other forces at work here. I’ve seen too many videos of random people and organizations – I’m not sure who these people are – showing up and breaking glass. I’ve seen kids being paid off, bricks left in random places like its Fortnite. It seems too coordinated for me to think that it’s all spontaneous.

Are there opportunists there? Yes, absolutely. It’s a small percentage of the protestors, but they exist, and it’s all the news is going to show. The way I feel about it is, you have angry people who are going to go on the streets and do whatever they feel.

Obviously the collateral damage is affecting small businesses, and I would like to see local businesses not get touched. Some of these corporations have mistreated people for years, so I don’t really sympathize with them. They’ve underpaid and overworked people. Like I said before, the undertone of these protests is economic in nature. People are starting to see that they cannot trust anything in this system and our money has to be tied to that thought process.

What do you make of major corporations making statements in support of the protests: Is it empty virtue signaling or representative of a greater sea-change?

I think most of it is virtue signaling. There are genuine actors who want to help, but there are also those who put out empty statements who don’t want to be seen on the wrong side of history. It is what it is, it’s what they have to do. A great form of peaceful protest is to not shop with businesses that don’t show full support of ending systemic violence. That’s how you hurt people, if they can’t make money, then racism becomes really stupid, really fast.

Why do you suppose the slogan “Bitcoin & Black America” has gained a bit of traction during the protests?

I’m glad it has caught on. I went through about 10 different names but I think I found a catchy one. If people think about it there is some synergy between bitcoin and Black America.

Once the smoke clears – what are we going to do, go back to the same system? – the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet past $6.5 trillion. Inflation is going to destroy a number of industries, so we have to find a way out. But the message is out there, it’s on sweatshirts and posters.

Where do we go from here?

We need solutions. The rioting and looting is not going to last forever, people do not have the gumption to be violent for months at a time.

First, we need police reform. From my standpoint, there has to be an emphasis on increasing the wealth of our community, and rebuilding trust, and being able to build something like Black Wall Street.

There was a time when, in the 1800s, where Black communities had established financial centers in Tulsa, Okla., in Richmond, Va., outside of Cincinnati, there was also a plan for something called Soul City. If Black people were left alone, we’d have been able to build ourselves up, but of course all of those places were burned to the ground by racist White people.

What I’m trying to show now is that we can do that now. But we need systems in place that can protect us and enable us to flourish economically. I don’t think people want handouts, I just think they want to be left alone.

Japan’s finance minister Taro Aso says he is opposed to reducing tax on bitcoin income to 20%, on par with stock dividends, arguing that most Japanese households find it difficult to invest in digital assets.

The development suggests that Japan will uphold its current definition of cryptocurrency as miscellaneous income, whereby virtual currency is taxed at rates of up to 55%.

Players in the crypto sector have been pushing for new legislation that would categorize cryptocurrency as stocks for similar tax treatment.

Responding to a question from Japan Restoration Association (JRA) member, Shun Otokita, at a recent meeting of the House of Councillors Committee on Financial Affairs, the finance minister said it would be difficult to persuade Japanese people to convert their cash savings to digital assets.

“Out of 1,900 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) financial assets held by households in Japan, around 900 trillion yen ($8.4 billion) is now being held as cash deposits and that is abnormal,” Aso said.

The minister also addressed the legal definition of digital currency. In terms of the Payment Services Act, introduced in May, “crypto-asset” has replaced all references in law to “virtual currency.”

Aso suggested another revision that would replace “crypto-asset” with “angō shisan,” the Japanese word for “stablecoin.” “The word ‘crypto’ sounds a bit shady so why don’t we use the Japanese word for stablecoin… Sounds more stable right?” he proposed.

The Payment Services Act also cut the leverage limit for cryptocurrency margin trading from 4x to 2x. JRA member Otokita questioned Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on lowering of the cap.

The agency said it arrived at the revision after consulting with experts and noting that such a cut was an appropriate response to the volatility of cryptocurrencies.

Worldwide, governments are looking to earn more from bitcoin by way of taxation, contrary to their previous attitudes, which targeted a complete ban on cryptocurrency usage.

Crypto exchanges Bittrex and Poloniex have been added as new defendants in the updated lawsuit, filed on June 3 in the Southern District Court of New York. The initial lawsuit was filed in October 2019.

The 156-page amended lawsuit alleges that the defendants manipulated the crypto market by fraudulently inflating prices and caused “billions of dollars of damage” to traders.

“Tether issued billions of USDT to itself with no U.S. dollar backing—simply creating the USDT out of thin air,” the filing says. “Tether hid that fact by ‘selling’ newly issued USDT to Bitfinex. [...] Because Bitfinex and Tether were essentially the same, Tether could simply transfer newly issued USDT into its account on Bitfinex without receiving U.S. dollars in exchange, as was required from genuine customers.”

The amended lawsuit further alleges that Bittrex and Poloniex were “knowing participants in the scheme,” meaning they knew that Bitfinex was transferring large amounts of unbacked USDT to their exchanges.

“Bittrex and Poloniex accepted these transfers and knowingly allowed Bitfinex and Tether—as owners of the addresses holding the USDT—to sell the debased USDT for cryptocommodities on their exchanges, driving up the cryptocommodity prices,” says the filing.

There are also some revisions to the plaintiff list in the amended lawsuit. Crypto trader Matthew Script has been added as an additional plaintiff, while David Leibowitz has been removed as a plaintiff. Global Trade Solutions AG, which was initially one of the defendants, has now been removed in the amended filing.

It is worth noting that the initial lawsuit claimed the total damages of $1.4 trillion. The amended filing does not mention that amount. The plaintiffs are now rather seeking “reasonable costs of suit, pre- and post-judgment interest, and reasonable attorneys’ fees” and are demanding a trial by jury for all claims.

It remains to be seen what a jury decides. The plaintiffs are represented by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche of Roche Cyrulnik Freedman LLP – the lawyers who are also involved in a federal lawsuit against Craig Wright from last year. Other representatives in the amended lawsuit are law firms Selendy & Gay PLLC and Schneider Wallace Cottrell Konecky LLP.

Following publication of this article, Bitfinex and Tether released a statement denouncing the amended class-action lawsuit filing.

“Even after taking three full months to amend their complaint, the plaintiffs’ allegations remain untethered to either the facts or the law. They conflate perceived correlation with causation in an effort to prop up theories that are untrue and unsupportable,"" Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner said in a statement, going on to add: ""Bitfinex and Tether will vigorously defend themselves, their customers, their stakeholders, and the crypto community against these unfounded allegations and continue to counter fiction with facts.""

Editor's Note: This article has been updated to note that the lawsuit involving Craig Wright was not won.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-bitcoin-analysis-idUSKBN23C0KS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors expecting a sudden surge in bitcoin’s price, after it underwent a technical adjustment three weeks ago that reduced the rate at which new coins are generated, may have to wait a few months, or perhaps a few years.

Bitcoin traded in narrow ranges after it went through a third so-called halving on May 11, which cut the rewards given to those who “mine” bitcoin to 6.25 new coins from 12.5.

There were some expectations that bitcoin would soar, similar to what happened after the two previous adjustments as the “halving” effectively decreased its supply.

The virtual currency has gained 11% since the adjustment, but it had more down days than up days and analysts said technical momentum overall was negative. In contrast, bitcoin had soared more than 40% from January this year until the “halving.”

On Thursday, bitcoin was at $9,783 BTC=BTSP. It breached $10,000 twice after the ""halving"" but retreated as it found tough resistance at that level.

“Bitcoin is on a see-saw, between bulls and bears,” said Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures. “On one end, we have network data and technicals; the other, strong fundamentals and a correlation to U.S. stock indices.”

He added that bitcoin’s network data is flashing more bearish than bullish signals, as he expects further short-term selling.

Beyond the short term though, many investors expect a price surge.

The first halving, in November 2012, catalyzed a rally for bitcoin from about $10 to $1,160 in 12 months. The second halving, in July 2016, saw bitcoin jump more than 300%, from $650 to $2,800 within the same time span.

“It may take six to 12 months for investors to reap the rewards of post-halving price movements,” said Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds.

“In reality, there is a significant time lag between the halving event and the establishment of renewed market equilibrium based on general supply and demand,” he added.

Since miners’ profits have contracted as block rewards decreased by 50%, the “halving” has affected the supply side of bitcoin and increased the time needed for miners to find their break-even point.

Once this is found, Stack’s Neo said, bitcoin is likely to realize its “halving-induced” price appreciation.

Investors are also banking on higher institutional demand to further propel the price of bitcoin. Fund flows into the biggest crypto asset managers have been robust in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

“When we look at institutional inflows for our products and that of another asset manager, what you’re seeing are purchases that have now outstripped, for the first time, new bitcoins being created by 150%,” said Danny Masters, chairman of CoinShares, with $1 billion in crypto assets.

Michael Sonnenshein, managing director at Grayscale with $4 billion in crypto assets under management, said since April the firm’s bitcoin investment fund has ballooned to $3.5 billion as of June 2, from $2 billion at the end of the first quarter.

“There’s a lot of momentum and interest in investing in digital currencies particularly in the face of uncertainty, the pandemic, political tensions, and the amount of stimulus being pumped into the global economy,” said Sonnenshein.

James Wo, chairman of Digital Finance Group, a $500 million crypto and blockchain fund, likens bitcoin to digital gold, and as such, the digital currency has barely scratched the surface.

“Bitcoin has great potential to grow,” said Wo. “Gold has an eight trillion-dollar valuation, while bitcoin has less than $200 billion dollars in valuation. It just needs more time for mainstream adoption. People need enough time to fully understand and believe in it.”",2020-06-05 05:38:59+00:00,,,

Unsealing its complaint against Utah resident Daniel F. Putnam, his businesses MMT Distributions and R & D Global and associates Angel A. Rodriguez of Utah and Jean Paul Ramirez Rico of Colombia, the SEC claimed the three had lied to investors and misappropriated funds.

The “Modern Money Team” (MMT), as Putnam apparently called both businesses, invested in crypto mining equipment from at least July 2017 and eventually pivoted to offering investors “cryptocurrency trading packages” that would exploit crypto “arbitrage” opportunities at Bitfinex, according to the complaint, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the District of Utah.Ramirez ran the crypto investments, Rodriguez was the liaison, and Putnam, a veteran of multilevel marketing, ran MMT.

Two hundred investors joined Putnam’s mining scheme, and MMT collectively raised $12 million from 2,000 investors in total, the SEC alleged. The SEC further alleged MMT ceased paying out investors in November 2019 but continued to raise funds through March 9, 2020.

But the complaint said some of the money never went toward crypto mining equipment or digital asset investments. Instead, Putnam spent over $100,000 of his investors’ funds on a condominium and $33,000 buying a spa, according to the SEC.

Ramirez controlled the Bitfinex account that Putnam told investors as recently as January 2020 held 260 bitcoin, according to the complaint. But the SEC alleged the account never held more than 50, and that it was closed in May 2019. Ramirez had been periodically making Ponzi-like payments to investors, the SEC alleged.

The SEC alleged Putnam and Rodriguez knew “or were reckless in not knowing” that Ramirez was running a Ponzi-like scheme based on WhatsApp communications.",2020-06-05 20:05:54+00:00,https://www.internationalinvestment.net/news/4016142/bitcoin-set-soar-value-devere-chief,"Bitcoin - already one of the year's best-performing assets - is likely to ""soar in value"" this year with central banks' money printing agendas and a spike in public interest, the CEO of deVere Group said this morning.

The bullish comment from deVere Group's founder, Nigel Green, follows a wider positive investor sentiment regarding the leading cryptocurrency. This week Bloomberg analysts said in a note that the digital currency could jump to $20,000 in 2020.

Green affirmed: ""Bitcoin price is already up around 30% from the beginning of the year, putting it on track to be one of the year's best-performing assets.

Bitcoin price is already up around 30% from the beginning of the year, putting it on track to be one of the year's best-performing assets.""

""I believe it would be surprising not to see Bitcoin soar in value further throughout this year for three key reasons.

Bitcoin underwent a scheduled ""halving"" last month, which led to an itial fall against the dollar. But the world's most popular cryptocurrency has since recovered its losses.

""First, the massive money-printing, or quantitative easing, programmes currently being rolled-out by central banks around the globe devalue traditional currencies and provide a boost for other recognised stores of value, such as Bitcoin and gold.

""Second, the global health emergency has been accelerating the demand and need for digital money.

""And third is that it is a legitimate hedge against longer-term inflation concerns.""

He continued: ""Globally, we have seen client interest in Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies such as ETH, spike since the beginning of May.

""There's been about a 25% month-on-month jump in enquiries about deVere Crypto, our crypto exchange app.

""We largely attribute this to the pandemic collectively focusing minds on readjusting to a new world.

""Of course, our lives in this new era, which was on its way but which has been ushered in faster due to Covid-19, will be increasingly tech-driven. This includes our financial lives, meaning digital currencies such as Bitcoin, amongst other fintech [financial technology] solutions.""

Geopolitical risks, including the heightening of U.S.-China tensions, Brexit and the U.S. presidential election can also be ""expected to serve as a boost for Bitcoin"" says Mr Green.

""Investors will increase exposure to decentralized, non-sovereign, secure digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, to help shield them from the potential issues in traditional markets.""

The deVere CEO concluded: ""2020's global public health emergency, the record-shattering policies implemented to soothe economic downturns, political uncertainty and social unrest can be expected to drive the price of Bitcoin upwards.""

Cryptocurrency derivatives trading volumes climbed 32% in May to a new record high of $602 billion, according to data analytics company Cryptocompare.

Total spot volumes grew at a slower pace, rising 5% to $1.27 trillion in May, the London-based firm said in a new report published June 4, 2020.

The figures show increasing investor interest in trading derivatives – contracts signed by at least two people to buy or sell a digital asset at an agreed price in the future. For the review month, derivatives market share rose to 32% compared to 27% in April.

May’s all-time-high represents a slight increase over the previous record of $600 billion in March.

Cryptocompare notes that bitcoin (BTC) derivatives saw large increases in trading volume last month, with institutional player Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rising fastest at 59% to $7.2 billion.

However, Huobi accounted for the largest trade volume of $176 billion, up 29% month-on-month followed by Okex and Binance with $152 billion and $139 billion trades’ worth, respectively.

Hong Kong-based Bitmex traded $94.8 billion, up 37% since April while trades at Deribit soared 22% to $13.4 billion.

Institutional options volumes on CME reached a monthly record of 5,996 contracts, up sixteen-fold from April. The regulated exchange also broke a new daily record on May 28, with trades of 1,418 Bitcoin options contracts. Derebit’s options volume spiked 109% in May to $3.06 billion.

CME’s futures contracts also gained by 36% in May, to volumes of 166,000.

Per the report, spot trading volumes surged sharply a day before the third halving, reaching $64.7 billion on May 10. But this fares lowly compared to the volume spikes of $66.2 billion on April 30, and that of $75.9 billion on March 13, a day after the Black Thursday BTC crash.

Cryptocompare said the bulk of spot trading happened on exchanges it considers low-tier and unregulated, accounting for $49.88 billion of the volume while top-tier exchanges traded $14.86 billion.

Despite the economic crisis, cryptocurrency trading platforms in India are reporting record-breaking volumes and new users. “People in India are betting big on bitcoin,” Paxful’s CEO said. “The Indian market holds great potential and importance for the future of the crypto-economy.”

Record-Breaking Growth Across the Indian Crypto Industry

Cryptocurrency trading volume has been growing by leaps and bounds across many exchanges in India despite the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis. Peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace Paxful announced Thursday its record-breaking performance in India.

From January to May, Paxful reported an increase of 883% in bitcoin’s trading volume over the same period last year, from approximately $2.2 million to $22.1 million. In May, the bitcoin trading volume on the platform was $6.2 million, a 41% increase, and new user signups increased by 12% for the month. On a monthly average, new user signups increased by 28%.

Recently, global cryptocurrency exchange Okex also revealed in a report that its “visits from India saw the highest increase, reaching 545.56%. According to Okex, newly registered users from India rose 4,100% during the same period,” the report states. “After the policy was loosened, the increase in trading volume was not only reflected in local exchanges, but also the major global exchanges.”

Several local crypto exchanges in India have independently told news.Bitcoin.com that they have been seeing huge growth in trading volumes and new users on their platforms, especially during the nationwide lockdown. The growth was fueled by the country’s supreme court quashing the banking ban by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in March. Wazirx and Unocoin recently said their trading volumes increased 10-fold. Zebpay also saw substantial growth in trading volume and new users during the lockdown. Meanwhile, new crypto exchanges are launching in India, while global exchanges are expanding in the country and venture capitalists are investing more in Indian crypto startups.

Great Potential for the Indian Crypto Industry

Paxful detailed that it “sees India as a center for innovation and is excited to see the growth and contribution Indians will bring to the industry.” The platform, which recently expanded operations in India, aims to use cryptocurrencies to “expand the financial inclusion and fiscal independence of a new generation of Indians.” Paxful CEO and co-founder Ray Youssef commented:

The Indian market holds great potential and importance for the future of the crypto-economy. People in India are betting big on bitcoin presenting an opportunity for greater financial returns.

“We are actively focussing our efforts on bringing cryptocurrency to the masses across the nation to aid in the eradication of poverty, boost economies, and create jobs, especially in the post-covid-19 economy,” he continued.

The Indian crypto sector is flourishing despite the covid-19 crisis and severe economic conditions throughout the country. Former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg recently said that he expects the Indian economy to contract by 10% this fiscal year. Global rating and research agency CRISIL said last week that India’s worst recession is here, concurring with Goldman Sachs’ prediction that the current recession is the country’s worst.

The behemoth cryptocurrency exchange has initiated procurement deals with a number of U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for a cryptocurrency investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics,” according to publicly available documents. The Block first reported on the prospective deals Friday.

Coinbase Analytics has close ties with Coinbase’s entire product ecosystem, as its Senior Product Manager “collaborates” with “Coinbase Consumer, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Custody as well as” Coinbase’s payments and crypto division, according to an undated but now closed job posting.

In an emailed statement, Coinbase said its Analytics product does not and has never used any internal customer data.

“Coinbase Analytics data is fully sourced from online, publicly-available data, and does not include any personally-identifiable information for anyone, regardless of whether or not they use Coinbase,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk.

Coinbase joins a crowded field of cryptocurrency analytics companies – Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace and others – vying for a piece of the federal pie. Agencies from all corners of the U.S government regularly contract with crypto intel firms, inking deals for their tracing software worth millions, and sometimes stretching years.

Apparently, Coinbase, who bought blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino in February 2019, is about to undercut the competition.

“This is the least expensive tool on the market and has the most features for the money,” read a DEA May notice so heavily redacted that those features’ specifics are unclear. But they are unique, as the IRS notice, published in April, notes Coinbase Analytics has “enhanced law enforcement sensitive capabilities that are not currently found in other tools on the market.”

Coinbase confirmed that it developed the Analytics product from Neutrino. It further stated that Analytics is available for financial institutions and law enforcement agencies alike, and is used in internal investigations.

“It’s an important tool to meet our regulatory requirements and protect our customers’ funds,” Coinbase said.

The DEA’s interest appears to stem in part from Coinbase Analytics’ pinpoint accuracy. It has “some of the most conservative heuristics used in commercial blockchain tracing tools,” a “critical” distinction in avoiding false positives, the DEA notice read.

Neither the DEA or IRS disclosed the bottom-line value of their prospective deals, which federal contract websites indicate have not been finalized yet. Both agencies seek year-long contacts with Coinbase, and the DEA deal is not more than $250,000.

The IRS has recently begun ramping up its activities in the cryptocurrency space, sending tax firms notices last month requesting proposals for auditing support.",2020-06-05 22:10:08+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-derivatives-exchange-okex-launches-options-on-ether,"Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx rolled out option contracts on Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token on Thursday, ending the Panama-based Deribit’s virtual monopoly in the space.

“OKEx ETH Options Contracts will be settled in ETH. Each contract’s face value of ETH/USD options is 1 ETH,” Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, told CoinDesk.

Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. While a call option represents a right to buy, a put option gives the holder the right to sell.

The mark prices of exchange’s options are determined by the Black-Scholes model on a real-time basis, and the final settlement price will be generated via a time-weighted average of the underlying price over a period of time ahead of expiry.

To avoid what OKEx calls a “societal clawback,” the exchange has already established an ETH/USD options insurance fund of 1,000 ETH, worth about $240,000 as of Friday. Clawbacks occur when the exchange’s insurance fund lacks sufficient reserves to cover investors’ total margin call losses. Exchanges face such shortages and socialize losses by clawing back a portion of the gains of profitable traders when the market unexpectedly sees a big bullish or bearish move, leading to forced unwinding of long/short positions.

“Options would give traders more versatility and a great way to hedge their risk,” said Hao. Ether’s fortunes are closely tied with the use of Ethereum in decentralized applications (dApps). Hence, one may argue ether options are hedging instruments for dApps.

Investor interest in the crypto derivatives market has exploded this year, with open interest in ether futures listed on major exchanges rising by 100%. Meanwhile, open interest in ether options listed on Deribit has skyrocketed by over 900%, according to the data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Total ETH Options Open Interest Source: Skew

As of Thursday, OKEx was the largest ether futures exchange by open interest, accounting for 26% ($179 million) of the global tally of $672 million. Further, the exchange recently surpassed BitMEX to become the largest bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange by open interest.

“Adding ETH options is a logical next step for us, and also a market demand particularly as we pride ourselves on the wide variety of products and features that we offer traders, allowing them to keep their pricing strategies more flexible,” said Hao.

While OKEx dominates the futures product, the options segment is ruled by Deribit exchange. As of Thursday, Deribit accounted for more than 75% of the total open interest of $1.3 billion in BTC options and contributed almost the entire open interest of $144.35 million in ether options. Meanwhile, OKEx contributed only 4% of the total open interest in BTC options.

OKEx, therefore, has plenty of ground to cover before threatening Deribit’s number one position in the options market. The exchange has traded $1 million worth of ether option contracts since inception and has $342,000 worth of open positions at press time.

Records obtained by The Block show that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intend to buy licenses from Coinbase for an analytics platform called Coinbase Analytics. Documents related the purchases by the IRS and DEA were published in April and May, respectively.

Notably, the IRS document draws a connection between Coinbase Analytics and Neutrino, an intelligence agency that Coinbase controversially purchased in 2019. The acquisition drew controversy due to its founders' involvement in the Italian spyware firm Hacking Team, and Coinbase ultimately said that it would part ways with team members associated with Hacking Team.

As the IRS document explains:

""As law enforcement techniques evolve and other cryptocurrencies gain acceptance, criminals are using other types of cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin to facilitate their crimes. In addition to the Bitcoin Blockchain, Coinbase Analytics (fka Neutrino) allows for the analysis and tracking of cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains that criminals are currently using. Coinbase Analytics also provides some enhanced law enforcement sensitive capabilities that are not currently found in other tools on the market. This action will result in a Firm Fix Priced purchase order, Period of Performance: One base year from date of award with one 12-month option.""

Public records indicate that Coinbase has not been officially granted the awards, and the company does not appear in queries submitted to USASpending.gov, a directory for government contract awards. According to this database page, Coinbase's registration to offer products and services to the U.S. government became active on April 28, with an expiration date of April 13, 2021.

When reached for comment, a Coinbase spokesperson told The Block that ""[t]he information offered in Coinbase Analytics has always been kept completely separate from Coinbase internal data,"" going on to say:

""Coinbase Analytics data is fully sourced from online, publicly available data, and does not include any personally-identifiable information for anyone, regardless of whether or not they use Coinbase. Coinbase Analytics is a blockchain analytics product that we use internally for compliance and global investigations. It's an important tool to meet our regulatory requirements and protect our customers' funds. We developed Coinbase Analytics with technology from the Neutrino acquisition. Coinbase also offers this product to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to support compliance and investigation use cases. This tool only offers them streamlined access to publicly-available data and at no point do they have access to any Coinbase internal or customer data.""

A request for comment sent to the Department of Justice was not returned by press time.

It is unclear how much Coinbase would be paid for the licenses. The DEA document includes a subheader explaining that it is ""Required for Limited Source Acquisitions Over $10,000 but not Exceeding $250,000,"" indicating that the amount paid would fall in that range.

The documents illustrate how the two agencies want to apply Coinbase's platform to their respective investigative toolkits. In the case of the IRS, the software would be utilized by the tax authority's Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit.

The DEA document states:

""Coinbase Analytics (CA) cryptocurrency intelligence tool, provides investigators with identity attribution and de-anonymities virtual currency addresses domestically and internationally. CA is known for its accuracy of attribution which includes some of the most conservative heuristics used in commercial blockchain tracing tools.

Reported by Coindesk on Thursday, the lawsuit alleged that the two exchanges together are storing nearly 500 Bitcoins stolen from the plaintiff Dennis Nowak, a German resident.

Xapo held 19.99 BTC while Indodax held 479.69 BTC from the total 500 Bitcoins of Nowak, the lawsuit alleged.

The court filing, however, did not specify the name of the exchange from where the funds were stolen. It only specified that the plaintiff was maintaining a crypto trading account with a Northern California-based exchange.

“On or about November 20, 2018, Plaintiff deposited into hisU.S.A. EXCHANGE account 500 bitcoin (500 BTC) in three separate deposits: (1) a200 BTC deposit, (2) a second 200 BTC deposit, and (3) a 100 BTC deposit,” the court filing noted.

Ignorance or intentional?

According to the plaintiff, the exchanges were aware of their inadequate know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) policies, but ignored them anyway.

The lawsuit is accusing the exchanges of aiding and abetting the theft and pointed out the violation of both federal and state laws by allowing the perpetrators to access the exchange’s services.

Even the perpetrators did not even attempt to hide the track of the stolen digital currencies and still got access to the exchanges.

Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, Nowak also hired David Silver, a longtime crypto lawyer, to fight his case in the court and they are also demanding a jury trial.

Nowak is now seeking a return of his “stolen personal property” along with additional relief. Notably, at the time of the theft, all the Bitcoins were worth $2.3 million.

“XAPO and INDODAX each know or should have known that the assets stolen from Plaintiff and stored within their custody were indeed stolen; however, XAPO and INDODAX have undertaken no efforts to return those stolen assets to Plaintiff,” the filing added.",2020-06-05 08:50:59+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/covid-crisis-crypto-awakening-developing-nations-george-floyd,"Regular readers of this column will know about the recent surge in African peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions, now at more than $12 million a week, according to Useful Tulips.

I think this, and similar patterns across other emerging market regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the most important cryptocurrency trend of the moment. We are a long way from mass adoption, but the circumstances driving this nascent demand in the developing world, not only for bitcoin but also for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, bring the human benefits of this new form of money into stark relief.

What’s driving this is a worldwide dollar shortage. For billions of non-Americans in places far from the United States’ now-unruly cities, the U.S. currency is a vital instrument in their daily lives. But it is now scarce. If you can’t get dollars and you don’t trust your local currency, bitcoin and stablecoins start to look attractive, either as a hedge against future inflation or as a payments or remittances solution.

Dollar shortages are the mirror image of the Federal Reserve’s “QE infinity” program and the reason it rapidly created swap lines with 16 central banks in industrialized countries in March. At that time, the pandemic had triggered a kind of global bank run into dollars. Debtors in European and Asian financial capitals who’d borrowed in dollars scrambled to buy them to cover margin calls on their collateral, which in turn sent investors racing to secure access to the same USD safe haven. As Jill Carlson wrote for CoinDesk, the Fed had no choice but to “turn on the taps” to feed the world’s demand.

Note some key words in that prior paragraph: “industrialized countries” and “financial capitals.” The Fed’s rescue mission might have stabilized global currency markets for now, but the Wall Street-centric structure of its policy implementation means the liquidity injections are far from evenly spread.

While quantitative easing has breathed life into U.S. stocks (see below), the shortages have persisted in many emerging markets, creating serious problems in their citizens’ lives. That’s especially so in many formally or informally “dollarized” countries, where mistrust of the local currency makes the dollar the preferred unit for business-to-business transactions, savings, and large-ticket consumer payments such as rent.

This is what’s happening in oil-exporting Nigeria, where the collapse in the price of crude has combined with the global dollar shortage to create a real USD crisis. It’s no wonder that Africa’s biggest economy is the biggest contributor to the pickup in the continent’s peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges.

Microtasking to survive

Consider also Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorship has unofficially abandoned constraints on dollar usage because an evaporation in the bolivar’s value has made it physically impossible for people to carry all the banknotes needed to buy groceries. Now, in the midst of the pandemic, home-bound Venezuelans can’t find the dollars they need. For some, bitcoin is offering a solution.

“USD bills are getting like a rare thing, like a collectible,” says journalist Javier Bastardo, who spoke to me from his electricity-challenged home in Caracas. “So, people are finding new ways to avoid the depreciation of the bolivar.”

One way, they are doing this, Bastardo said, is by “doing microtasks, connecting to a website where you can earn 10 satoshis (0.0000001 BTC) for doing different things.”

Yes, crowdsourced microtasking, by which companies get large numbers of people to collectively teach human intuition to machine-learning algorithms – think of those sign-on requests to identify traffic lights – is now a money-earner for people in the developing world. Developments in crypto technology have enabled this.

Previously, on-chain bitcoin fees – currently around $3 per transaction – were too high to sustain the kinds of micropayments made for these many small tasks. But advances in the layer two Lightning Network, which allows for secure off-chain transactions, now mean that sites such as Stak can affordably provide these money-earning services to their customers. Stak users in the Philippines and Argentina can earn enough satoshis to buy smartphones offered on the site.

Stablecoins' opening

Developing-country demand for bitcoin, however, still seems less based on its role as a payments vehicle than on its appeal as a gold-like speculative asset and store-of-value, an especially valuable proposition in places threatened by hyperinflation. What, though, of the challenge of day-to-day payments and remittances in dollar-scarce countries?

This is where stablecoins could be stepping up.

Latin American wallet provider Ripio offers evidence of that. CEO Sebastian Serrano says active user demand for the platforms’s stablecoin offerings, USDC and Dai, grew tenfold in the first quarter.

The reason seems pretty clear: people want what they’re used to.

“What people want in Nigeria or in Venezuela isn’t really bitcoin but the U.S. dollar,” says Alejandro Machado, a colleague of Carlson’s at the Open Money Initiative. “So if you can have an asset that mimics or behaves like dollars perhaps we have a solution.”

For Machado, the solution doesn’t lie in Ethereum-based stablecoins like tether, USDC or dai, but in leveraging the liquidity that he says only bitcoin can provide. He’s currently working with Valiu, a service targeted at Venezuelans that doesn’t create stability through a reserve model like Tether or USDC, or through a smart contract-based collateral system like Dai, but synthetically. Through a sophisticated strategy for trading and hedging bitcoin, Valiu offers access to a digitally executed contract whose value holds steady against the dollar.

These various solutions are landing in emerging markets that are, once again, reeling from problems that emanate from industrialized countries. Whether they’ll achieve mainstream usage rates remains to be seen. (The $8 million daily turnover for bitcoin trades in Nigeria, for example, although double that of two months ago, is a tiny drop within that country’s $420 billion economy.)

Still, there appears to be a clear and broad-based uptrend in demand. It speaks to what many of us have long argued: that the most obvious use cases for cryptocurrency lie in the developing world.

I think this, and similar patterns across other emerging market regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the most important cryptocurrency trend of the moment. We are a long way from mass adoption, but the circumstances driving this nascent demand in the developing world, not only for bitcoin but also for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, bring the human benefits of this new form of money into stark relief.

A bifurcated American Dream

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, with its specially tailored selection of 30 important companies’ stocks, was designed by its founders as a snapshot of the American economy. It’s one reason why the performance of “the Dow” is often used as a proxy measure of U.S. prosperity, a rather simplified encapsulation of the American Dream. So it’s worth asking: how has this most famous of Wall Street indicators done over the past two weeks?

Between May 25, the Memorial Day holiday on which Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, and Thursday, June 4, the Dow gained 7.4%, marking the best 50-day performance for U.S. stocks ever. And now, after some surprisingly good unemployment numbers, they are up again as of Friday afternoon (by more than 930 points as of 5:48 p.m. UTC).

How the Dow has performed since May 25, the date of George Floyd's murder. Source: FactSet

Let’s put this in context. Within the past nine trading days, millions swarmed into American cities to protest the unending injustice and racial inequality that this crime represented. There were violent responses from some members of the security forces and alarming acts of destruction and theft from some of the protesters. Meanwhile, as the nation’s political divisions were deepened by a President who seemed to want to fan the flames, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 100,000. Yet the stock market was up, CNBC pundits said, on hope of a stronger-than-expected economic recovery.

I have an alternative theory: investors know that the longer America is gripped by an existential crisis, the more money the Fed will pour into financial assets. I’m not sure how enriching hedge funds at this time will help overcome this country’s divisions. It will only underscore the failure of our financial system and the need for an alternative. It’s time for a new system.

The Global Town Hall

KYCING OUR VIDEO CALLS Thanks to COVID-19 lockdowns, the world now lives on Zoom. So it’s no wonder eyebrows were raised when company CEO Eric Yuan this week said non-paying customers wouldn’t get privacy-protecting end-to-end encryption. Citing a presentation to investors this past week, Bloomberg’s Nico Grant reported Yuan as saying, “Free users for sure we don’t want to give that because we also want to work together with the FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose.” There were understandable privacy concerns among the crypto community, though Abra CEO Bill Barhydt pointed out that Zoom, which currently has no ad model or other means of monetizing free users, could never afford the expensive exercise of encrypting everybody. What struck me, though, was how the arrangement made this information platform’s customer relationship look like that of a bank. If you buy a Zoom subscription, it won’t be able to snoop on your calls, but it will know who you are. Sound familiar? Know-your-customer, or KYC, rules are the bedrock of how banks serve law enforcement’s efforts to catch money launderers. I suppose we shouldn’t be surprised: money is just a form of information anyway.

FORKING THE MEME Memes can be one of the most entertaining things on the internet… until you become one, of course. What started as a footnote in the larger protests surrounding the killing of George Floyd – a photo of a person whom we can only conclude is a bitcoin bro, or at least aspires to be one, held up a sign with the slogan “Bitcoin will save us” – became a cautionary tale. The image predictably went viral, drawing the ire of people inside and outside of the crypto community for pushing crypto gospel at precisely the wrong time.

That would have been the end of it, except someone in that community photoshopped the face of bitcoin proponent Neeraj Agrawal – himself widely thought of as Crypto Twitter’s meme king – onto the head of the protester, giving the viral image a second, stronger life (not sharing or linking here to prevent further “infection”). For those in the know, it was a cleverly ironic visual twist, but with so many Twitter users with high follow counts liking, retweeting or commenting on the image, it inevitably veered over the edge of context collapse when it reached a wider audience. As Agrawal himself noted, the proliferation of the doctored image probably wasn’t good for him (or bitcoin) — a reminder that, on social media, with great influence comes great responsibility. –Pete Pachal

GOD, THAT’S GOOD … BUT I have to hand it to Frances Coppola. That was a superb biblical metaphor in her CoinDesk op-ed about why Libra caved in to regulators’ demands and ended its currency basket model. Citing the Tower of Babel story, the writer compared Facebook and its fellow Libra Association members to those “upstart humans [who] challenged God (aka government) by building something that would, by reaching to heaven, threaten his authority.” Taking the analogy further, Coppola said a currency is like a language – which it very much is. Just as God punished the humans by making them speak mutually incomprehensible languages, so too did the powers of government force Libra to break up its operation into multiple, independent stablecoins.

Here’s the thing: As per Jack Miles’ book “God: A Biography” about the shifting depiction of the Old Testament’s God as a character, it’s we humans who decide what God is like. (Humans made God in their likeness, not vice versa.) We do the same with our governments – with varying degrees of democratic participation. Just as we have sometimes made God a benevolent, loving figure, we’ve occasionally produced benign governments. But we’ve also allowed terrible, malevolent leaders to take power, much like the spiteful God that Miles documents in numerous parts of his wonderful deconstruction. Now’s a time when we humans should be rewriting the character of our government – or more specifically, the governance of our financial system. And while Libra sure ‘aint perfect, and could allow its owners to exploit the people they’re supposed to serve, it has the potential to contribute to a better system. In fact, with those otherwise independent stablecoins built on Libra’s open-source, interoperable code base, they may well end up talking to each other.

God and governments will always be around. But there are times when we need to reimagine him/her/them. This is one of those times.",2020-06-05 20:18:31+00:00

According to Glassnode, a blockchain data and intelligence provider miners have stopped selling their generated Bitcoin. In fact, miner outflow is at it’s lowest level ever.

What does this mean for Bitcoin?

This is pretty good news for the rest of the Bitcoin community. Weak hands in both trading and mining are setup to get eliminated. Miners that are struggling to keep afloat have most likely already sold all of their assets, while the well-off’s are keeping their Bitcoin close to heart, until the market changes in their direction.

Without the downward selling pressure of Bitcoin miners, there’s nothing to stop the price from growing upward as far as demand takes it. Until miners start selling their BTC again, the supply is limited to what is already available in the market.

Does this mean that the price of BTC will go up soon? Maybe, but there are no guarantees. The market does not follow logical conclusions, and from what we’ve seen from the BTC market, it really doesn’t care about fundamental news.

So take this piece of news with a grain of salt. It’s looking good, but miners can change their mind at any moment and bring the price down. Also, let’s not forget about whales having a significant amount of influence over the BTC market.

This is prime time for market manipulation by big holders of BTC. The price has been breaking $10k USD mark on the 1st of June, only to drop back down again.

Survival of the fittest

In regards to miners, only the ones that were ready will be able to continue mining and take the hits. Miners left the Bitcoin network for a short while, but they are returning. According to Alejandro De La Torre, VP at Poolin, one of the biggest mining pools today, this current mining difficulty represents one of the highest percentage changes in the entire BTC history.

https://twitter.com/bitentrepreneur/status/1266307324815323138

It’s expected that miners will go out of business due to the stress of the halving and the reduced rewards. This means a lot less small miners and a stronger competitive position between mining pools. Big mining companies will be influenced as well, and the decisions made by these big players today will redefine the mining industry for the future.",,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-8391737/Is-price-bitcoin-set-surge-cryptocurrency-halved-month.html,"Bitcoin watchers have told investors who expect its price to boom on the back of its recent halving to be patient and not expect instant returns - despite the cryptocurrency rising more than 14 per cent in a month.

There was a surge in demand for it ahead of the event in early May, which has cut the reward for digitally mining bitcoin in half, making it harder to obtain in future, making it scarcer and potentially making existing coins more valuable.

Since 11 May, the price has steadily increased from just under £7,000, and hit a new post-halving high of £8,010 at the start of June.

It has slid a little since then but that rise still represents a healthy return of 14.7 per cent since the halving, compared to a 4.2 per cent rise in the US S&P 500 index over the same period.

Golden ticket? Bitcoin went up 14% between its May halving and the start of June but some think it could take a while before the price really takes off

Danny Scott, the chief executive of Isle of Man-based cryptocurrency exchange Coin Corner, who previously made the eye-catching prediction to This is Money that bitcoin could reach $1million within five years, said the halving was 'not usually an instant impact event'.

He said: 'It takes time for the supply and demand curve to take shape.

'Looking back, we've typically seen bitcoin take between three to nine months after a halving event to reach the previous all-time high, which means, if history repeats itself, we can expect to see $20,000 – or £15,839 - anytime between August 2020 and February 2021.'

Investors who took a punt on bitcoin when it collapsed in price along with other assets in the big coronavirus-fuelled market crash in late February and March have already cashed in.

It hit a low of £3,900 a coin on 16 March and has since rebounded strongly. Scott added: 'The second quarter has previously proved to be a strong quarter during bitcoin's life, with only one of the last six years, 2018, resulting in a negative movement.

'We are currently up around 53 per cent for the second three months 2020, and this is looking to be potentially one of the strongest of the last six years.'

While always unstable, Bitcoin has seen a steady increase in its price since 11 May

While last month saw bitcoin's third halving since its inception, it is the first time it has taken place since the cryptocurrency has become a household name, with the two previous times occurring in 2012 and 2016.

These halvings take place every time 210,000 blocks are mined, and this year will cut the reward for mining blocks from 12.5 to 6.25.

Bitcoin is mined as specialised computers add transaction records to bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions.

Bitcoin can be mined in 10 minutes, but the process is energy-intensive, supposedly matching the energy usage of the population of Switzerland.

Bitcoin hit all-time highs in 2016 and 2012 when it previously underwent halvings, but those were both before it became well-known

While the price hit all-time highs in both 2012 and 2016 according to Coin Corner, both these were dwarfed by the subsequent boom in bitcoin which took place in the run-up to Christmas in 2017.

In June 2016, the price sat at £610 a coin, by the following December it hit £14,000.

And although the increased name recognition of and demand for bitcoin likely complicates a like-for-like comparison, Scott is still confident we are set for another bull run on the back of this latest halving.

He said: '22 days after previous halving events, we saw an increase of 0.7 per cent in 2012 and 8.5 per cent in 2016, which shows that we are currently outpacing history at a significant rate.'",2020-06-06 08:17:32+01:00,https://decrypt.co/31485/coinbase-license-analytics-irs-dea,"Coinbase is reportedly looking to license its blockchain analytics software to United States federal agencies—the DEA and IRS. Image: Shutterstock

In brief Coinbase will reportedly license its analytics software to the IRS and DEA.

Prominent members of the crypto community sounded off about the report.

Coinbase previously faced criticism with its March 2019 acquisition of Neutrino.

On Friday, The Block reported that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase was looking to license its blockchain analytics software to United States federal agencies—notably the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

A spokesperson for Coinbase told Decrypt that ""This tool only offers them streamlined access to publicly-available data and at no point do they have access to any Coinbase internal or customer data.”

But put Coinbase, the IRS, DEA, and talk of “identity attribution” together in a story and it’s little surprise that people throughout the crypto and blockchain industry are aghast at the prospect of the popular exchange in cahoots with federal agencies.

Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of Bitcoin key security company Casa had one of the most strongly-worded and widely-shared tweet reactions, writing: “This is no surprise, our distrust in you is strengthened, we will make your analytics software obsolete.”

Crypto trader Josh Rager pointed to a Whale Alert tweet noting that 6,000 Bitcoin had just been moved from Coinbase, writing: “Millions of dollars seem to be leaving Coinbase as we speak. Investors & Traders are no longer limited to Coinbase or Bitmex. If you screw over customers, take part in shady deals or don't improve product, customers can now go elsewhere to trade/invest.”

That’s just the tip of the iceberg for Twitter takes. Bitcoin entrepreneur Matt Odell tweeted at Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and asked, “Why do you hate your customers so much?” And The Crypto Lark opined, “Really just been a downhill slide since they came out against WikiLeaks.”

This isn’t the first time that Coinbase has encountered controversy and criticism. The aforementioned suspension of WikiLeaks’ Coinbase account in April 2018 drew some ire, but the larger public pushback came last year when a #DeleteCoinbase movement sprung up on social media.

And in March 2019, Coinbase acquired Neutrino, the blockchain analytics provider that’s mentioned in documentation from the IRS. Three of the company’s board members had been involved with Hacking Team, a company that sold spyware to oppressive regimes in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Venezuela.

Coinbase ultimately sacked those board members, but the very same week, a Coinbase executive said that a previous analytics partner had sold customer data. In any case, the confluence of controversies led to a significant backlash.

Will the #DeleteCoinbase hashtag get dusted off once more? All that depends on how Coinbase handles its latest PR disaster.

Editor's note: A previous version of this article indicated that a Coinbase executive claimed that Elliptic had sold the customer data. This was incorrect and we regret the error.",2020-06-06 12:29:49,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-trader-google-helps-scam-crypto-trading-app-look-legit-reviews/,"Bitcoin Trader: Google Helps Scam Crypto Trading App Look Legit in Reviews

Bitcoin Trader has been heavily promoting itself as the best and safest automated cryptocurrency trading app that can help people earn $1,300 a day. Numerous fake reviews and scam checks on Bitcoin Trader are highly ranked by Google, making this scam appear legitimate. News.Bitcoin.com investigates this investment scam.

Bitcoin Trader Scam

Many bitcoin scams have emerged as unemployment rises worldwide during the economic crisis and coronavirus pandemic. One investment scheme that has recently gained more attention due to its aggressive marketing tactics is called Bitcoin Trader. It claims to be “an automated trading software” that can “trade cryptocurrencies and forex in both automated and manual mode.” However, there are many red flags about this platform.

The Bitcoin Trader website resembles numerous other investment schemes that news.Bitcoin.com has already uncovered as scams, such as Bitcoin Superstar, Bitcoin Era, Bitcoin Revolution, Bitcoin Evolution, and Bitcoin Loophole. Besides a cookie-cutter website, these scams have the same setup.

Bitcoin Trader’s official website has changed its URL several times but its logo remains unchanged. Its content has also slightly changed a few times since the beginning of the year when news.Bitcoin.com began tracking the scheme. Initially, Bitcoin Trader advertised that only bitcoin could be traded using its tools but later claimed that users can also trade in other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash, ethereum, monero, litecoin, XRP, and dash.

The front page of the Bitcoin Trader website has an urgent message in red at the top of the page that reads: “Warning: Due to extremely high media demand, we will close registration as of [today’s date] – Hurry.” Over the five-month period which news.Bitcoin.com followed this scheme, registration never closed but the warning message continues to appear with today’s date instead. The website also displays a video about bitcoin, featuring several famous people commending the cryptocurrency such as Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Others that have been used to promote Bitcoin Trader include Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and the Winklevoss twins.

$1,300 Per Day and Other Promises That Are Too Good to Be True

Bitcoin Trader lures investors desperate to make money fast in this time of economic crisis with promises that are too good to be true. Its website displays messages like “you can usually expect to earn at least $1,300 per day,” “some users reportedly earning their first $1 million in a couple of months,” and “you will only need to work for about 20 minutes every day.”

A few testimonials are also featured on the Bitcoin Trader website of supposed members who have made money using the platform. However, these reviews are fake and images used are stock photos.

The Bitcoin Trader platform also falsely claims to be the best, the most legit, and the safest bitcoin trading app. Its website states that the software has “a world-leading accuracy rate of 99.4%,” is the “safest investing app in the industry,” is “100% genuine,” and “we have testimonials from many of our members which praise our app’s ability to generate them huge profits over a short period of time.” The site further notes that the Bitcoin Trader app “has a success rate of 99.4%, which makes it the highest-rated in the market. Because of that, it is considered the most dependable, as well as being award-winning and very well credited.”

Google Helping, Aggressive Marketing Tactics, Fake Reviews

Bitcoin Trader employs aggressive marketing tactics to draw unsuspecting investors. The people behind the scheme themselves or their affiliates have published press releases about the scheme and peppered the internet with fake reviews, news, and scam checks in an effort to convince investors that Bitcoin Trader is a legitimate platform and not a scam. For example, a press release was published on the popular AP News website in May entitled “Bitcoin Trader review 2020 – Is it really a scam?” It details how to sign up with Bitcoin Trader and tries to convince its readers that Bitcoin Trader is a legit trading app.

The Bitcoin Trader website itself even has a section to say that it is not a scam. “First things first, Bitcoin Trader is not a scam,” the Bitcoin Trader website states.

Many fake reviews are found online and quite a number of them are well-ranked by Google. The American technology and search engine giant, which owns the popular video-sharing website Youtube, has been known to rank scam websites better than legitimate ones, making scam reviews look legit. Google and Youtube earn ad revenues from listing these scam websites and reviews. Youtube is also currently generating a great deal of ad revenue from listing and recommending videos promoting a 5,000 BTC giveaway scam to its users. This reoccurring scam features Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk and Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya giving away bitcoin.

What Happens When Signing Up With Bitcoin Trader

News.Bitcoin.com signed up for an account with Bitcoin Trader to see how it really works. After providing a name, an email address, and a phone number, we were logged in without being asked to confirm our email address. The back end of Bitcoin Trader looks almost identical to other scams we have reviewed, such as Bitcoin Loophole.

A notice soon popped up in the middle of our screen, asking us to deposit funds, which must be done via credit cards: Discover, Mastercard, Visa, Maestro, or American Express. “Click the ‘Deposit’ button below and you will be transferred to the broker’s secure payments page in order to deposit funds into your trading account and to start reaping the full benefits of our software. Note that you will be required to complete an account verification process and to verify your identity,” the notice reads. The minimum deposit is $250 and “The deposited amount can take up to 72 hours to reflect in your account,” the website adds.

A section of the Bitcoin Trader dashboard lists the “current brokers.” In our case, a company called Marketfornow was listed. Clicking “deposit” or any other links to “get started” transferred us to Marketfornow’s website, which has five account levels ranging from $250 to $50,000. You cannot proceed unless you deposit at least $250. At this point, you will be dealing directly with this “broker,” which claims to be a Seychelles company focusing on forex and contract-for-difference (CFD) trading. Every link on Bitcoin Trader redirects to a page on the broker’s website.

To find out which other companies are associated with Bitcoin Trader, news.Bitcoin.com signed up with the scheme a second time. The listed “current broker” this time was called “Interactivetrade,” whose website states that it is owned and operated by Dristor Solutions Ltd., a company supposedly located in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Several reviews online also warn that this offshore broker is a scam.

A review website, Thatsucks.com, was redirected to a different broker when reviewer Martin Kay signed up with Bitcoin Trader. He got sent directly to the cashier page on Optionstars where he was prompted to make a deposit. After navigating the Optionstars website and seeing no evidence of a robot or autotrader, he concluded: “Is the Bitcoin Trader a scam? Yes. It is.” He also concluded that Optionstars, a supposed broker headquartered in Samoa, is also a scam.

These so-called brokers claim to specialize in CFD trading, which carries very high risk. A large number of scams have been known to target CFD trading specifically and many authorities have advised how to recognize them. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) warns: “If you are solicited by a company that claims to trade in CFDs and asks you to invest funds, you should be very careful … Get rich schemes, including those involving CFDs, tend to be scams.”

Anyone looking for investment opportunities involving cryptocurrencies needs to take extreme caution as many online scams may appear legitimate. They may even have fake licensing information as well as a fake address but any funds sent to them are not likely to be seen again.

Additionally, Augur acts as a decentralized oracle — a source that verifies real-world occurrences. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain.

Augur is a set of open-source smart contracts, coded in solidity, that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. When executed, these smart contracts settle payments in ETH with participating users.

Augur operates with two cryptocurrencies. REP (or reputation) is a staking token used by reporters to clarify disputes on outcomes of the prediction market. Users lock REP tokens in escrow, thereby staking them, in order to assert the outcome of a particular created market. There is a specific incentive structure incorporated in augur’s platform that rewards reporting on correct outcomes, penalizes reporting on incorrect outcomes, and penalizes passive holders who don’t stake on disputes and forks.

The augur protocol is supported by The Forecast Foundation – a group of developers who contribute to the maintenance and development of the protocol, but do not own or control it. The foundation does not receive fees from the protocol and has no role in the operation of created markets among other restrictions.

As of 2019, augur had finalized 2,110 markets.

How does Augur work?

Vision

Augur was founded in 2014 by Jack Peterson and Joey Krug. They sought to create a shift away from traditional prediction markets, which are centralized, meaning participants needed a trustworthy entity to maintain an honest ledger of truth. Similarly, to determine the outcome of a predictable event, an impartial, trusted judge needed to conclude a correct outcome to distribute payouts.

Augur aimed to eliminate the risk of self-interested behavior, corruption and theft by decentralizing the prediction markets. The protocol operates through automated executable smart contracts that pull information from augur’s oracle, a source of information flowing from the real world to the blockchain. Augur markets flow in stages of creation, trading, reporting and settlement.

Launch and Issuance

In 2015, Augur facilitated one of the first initial coin offerings (ICO) on Ethereum and raised over $5 million through the sale of REP tokens. It originally sold 80%, 8.8 million REP, to raise these funds. The sale was conducted in four rounds, and the price paid was dependent on the final price of the token sale and a discount depending on which round the tokens were purchased.

The True Augur round, round one, lasted Aug. 17-22 during which participants received a 15% bonus. The Prophet round, round two, lasted Aug. 22-28 and offered a 10% bonus. The Nate Silver round, round three, offered a 5% bonus from Aug. 28-Sept. 5. The Nostradamus round, the final round, offered no bonus.

The remaining 20%, 2.3 million REP, was allocated to the Forecast Foundation, the founders and advisers.

Network Design and Security

The augur markets are a set of open-source smart contracts, coded in Solidity, that are deployed on the ethereum blockchain. When executed, these smart contracts settle payments in ETH with participating users.

Any user can create a market based on any real-world event, and upon creation, trading begins. When creating a market, the user builds a smart contract with the market’s rules outlined in the code. All users in the network have the ability to trade, until the event in which the market is based has occurred. Once the outcome is determined via augur’s oracle system, traders close out their position and potentially collect their payouts.

Reporters report on a market by staking REP tokens on a possible outcome. This is the act of a reporter declaring the “truth,” staking the real-world outcome of the market’s underlying event. The consensus of the market’s reporters is considered the “truth,” which allows augur to act as a decentralized oracle.

REP holders must stake their tokens on correct outcomes to receive an incentivized reward, a portion of the market’s settlement fees. If a report is incorrect, the reporter receives a penalty that negates the potential reward fees. REP holders that do not stake on disputes or participate in a fork (a large dispute) are also penalized. Once a market is reported and the “truth” is discovered, ETH is rewarded in settlement to those who predicted the correct outcome.

According to augur’s whitepaper, the trustworthiness of the forking process to be effective upon a large network dispute corresponds to REP’s market cap. If the market cap is large enough and attackers are economically rational, the attackers would not mount an attack because it would be too costly. If forks are trusted for large disputes, the incentives in place can encourage users to behave honestly without initiating a fork. A fork takes up to 60 days to resolve as a more stringent process for a highly disputed single market.

Additionally, Augur has a bug bounty program in which security engineers and hackers can be rewarded for disclosing identified bugs and vulnerabilities in its codebase and contracts.

Monetary Policy

The REP supply is capped at 11 million tokens, and when REP is earned it is received from another reporter on the network. When reporters report an outcome incorrectly, they are penalized, as are those users who do not participate in reporting. The REP taken as a penalty is then able to be earned by reporters correctly reporting real-life events, along with the reward of dynamically adjusted settlement fees.

Transaction Processing

Users in augur trade shares representing certain outcomes, rather than exchange value in terms of a particular currency. A complete set of shares includes one share of each possible valid outcome of a particular event. Shares are matched by augurs on-contract matching engine in order for participants to trade them. If Alice is willing to pay .6 ETH for a share of A and Bob is willing to pay .4 ETH for a share of B, 1 ETH would be held in escrow by the contract, and they would each receive their proportions of the complete set of shares. These shares would then be tradable on the free market.

The smart contracts for all of augur’s markets are executed through ethereum node operators and recorded to the ethereum blockchain.

Shetty noted via Twitter:

“[I am] especially impressed with the direction that the Telangana Government is taking in this sector. Expect them to see rapid growth.”

While sharing recommendations on how to further develop the emerging distributed ledger technology (DLT) ecosystem, Shetty pointed out that centralized applications can be built fairly easily today because of infrastructure that has been built over many years.

However, he argues:

“There’s not enough infrastructure for rapid blockchain and crypto development.”

He suggested building and supporting startups that provide the critical underlying technology infrastructure for “a decentralized future.”

Notably, WazirX and most other digital asset exchanges across the globe mainly focus on encouraging users to trade and invest in highly speculative cryptocurrrencies. Apart from Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and a few other virtual assets, all others provide little or no meaningful value or use case.

Multiple reports have confirmed that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto projects have been scams. Moreover, initial exchange offerings (IEOs), which are token sales facilitated by crypto exchanges, have also not lived up to expectations.

Last month, WazirX teamed up with Binance to launch “Polaris” which is part of a project called “Blockchain for India.” The initiative aims to provide assistance to India’s blockchain or DLT focused startups through the Binance Open Platform. It will offer between $5,000 to $100,000 in seed funding to high-potential or promising projects.

The funding project consists of the Polaris Kickstart program and the Polaris Blitzscale Program.

The first program focuses mainly on early-stage firms and initiatives. Crypto projects that are part of this program may receive between $5,000 and $20,000 in funding. Initiatives selected for these programs will get access to Binance’s open development platform.

The Polaris Blitzscale program is intended for companies needing seed funding. Applicants must already have a proof of concept/prototype or deployed application. Projects that are chosen for this program may get between $20,000 and $100,000 in capital.

Binance and WazirX will also be offering financing options from anywhere $100,000 and $5 million through a direct investment program (will include both equity and crypto tokens) managed under the Blockchain for India Fund.

The Blockchain for India Fund also aims to work cooperatively with various local venture funds that are involved in the nation’s emerging digital asset sector.",2020-06-16 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,

The report goes on to state that if things continue at the same rate, the total volume of stolen crypto for 2020 has the potential to get close to reaching the $4.5-billion mark set in 2019. Criminals appear to be capitalizing on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to target unsuspecting individuals by luring them in via a variety of crypto-related phishing campaigns, ransomware and darknet marketplace fraud.

Additionally, out of the multiple scams that have been accounted for this year, many of them have reportedly made use of email campaigns impersonating various coronavirus-related official groups — such as the World Health Organization, the Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — to solicit payments and donations in the form of cryptocurrency.

Lastly, CipherTrace officials claim that of the $1.36 billion in crypto stolen so far this year, 98% of the total value — nearly $1.3 billion — can be attributed to fraud and misappropriation rather than to hacks and direct thefts.

Scammers have continued to evolve their methodologies

To gain a better understanding of where the market seems to be heading in the coming months and years, particularly when it comes to crypto crime, Cointelegraph spoke to John Jefferies, the chief marketing officer and chief financial analyst at CipherTrace. In his view, while it is nearly impossible to predict with any certainty how trends related to cryptocurrency theft and fraud will evolve this year, it is possible that by the time the year comes to a close, the amount of funds netted by criminals may exceed the expectations of the report, betting 2019’s $4.5 billion figure.

Further elaborating on the subject, Jefferies stated that the largest contributor to this year’s crypto crime total has been Wotoken’s alleged billion-dollar Ponzi scheme that emerged from China. Furthermore, he is concerned in the coming months about exit scams by smaller virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, that that are struggling financially, adding:

“Retail investors should be wary of any company that uses hyperbolic statements and promises of extraordinary returns to lure them into participating. If WoToken had been required by regulatory agencies to provide detailed investment prospectus and audited financial statements, they wouldn’t have been able to launch their scheme and fool more than 700,000 victims. Many VASPs have dramatically improved their security posture, making it harder for hackers to steal from the platforms themselves.”

An even bleaker picture was painted by Pawel Aleksander, the co-founder and chief information officer of CoinFirm — a blockchain analytics company. He told Cointelegraph that as per his company’s own research and analysis, the volume of crypto funds stolen within the first quarter of 2020 may actually be closer to the $2 billion mark, highlighting:

“Knowing the amounts related to the various fraud happening as a whole has its importance but the most important aspect is addressing how to solve them and providing entities with the tools and solutions to do so.”

The pandemic has made things worse

As a result of the ongoing coronavirus situation, an increasing number of people have started to spend more time in front of their computer and smartphone screens. Naturally, scammers have recognized this fact and are trying to seize this opportunity by devising novel ploys — promising high returns on various crypto-related offerings such as binary options, trust trading, etc. — to lure in unsuspecting individuals.

Commenting on the issue of how companies can best limit the spread of crypto-related scams, Aleksander stated that despite most social media platforms and messengers attempting to come down more seriously and limit such nefarious schemes, there are still many challenges that have yet to be tackled successfully. In his view, a balanced ecosystem is required, in which Anti-Money Laundering procedures can be democratized and users are given a voice:

“This can happen by achieving a synergy between AML, fraud investigations and an open data ecosystem that takes the security of crypto financial markets to a level never seen before or even thought possible in traditional finance.”

In this regard, he believes that a threefold solution is needed — i.e., one that is based on an AML technological platform that enables institutions to verify the risk of blockchain transaction counterparties and meet their regulatory obligations. Not only that, but the platform should also have the capability to facilitate end-to-end investigations in cases where funds are reported missing as well as incentivize the reporting of suspicious activities. Aleksander closed out by saying: “If the industry collectively adopts such solutions and processes, the capability of such scams of not only being successful but being able to take advantage of the stolen funds will become severely limited.”

A similar point of view is shared by Jefferies, who also believes that banks, VASPs and other money service businesses can safeguard themselves against bad actors that are utilizing their platforms and payment networks to launder money as well as engage in other illegal activities by deploying effective AML measures.

How do Bitcoin ATMs fit into all of this?

A striking aspect of CipherTrace’s above-mentioned report involves the “exponential” rise of funds being sent to high-risk exchanges from United States-based Bitcoin ATMs rather than lower-risk entities such as established crypto exchanges. This has prompted experts to believe that BATMs may be at a greater risk of being used to launder money, especially given the preponderance of funds sent from them overseas, potentially to jurisdictions with lax AML and Know Your Customer policies.

Providing his insights on the matter, Jefferies stated that part of the reason for the increasing use of BATMs by money launderers, such as in the Kunal Kalra case, is their increasing ubiquity across the U.S. He added:

“Even in spite of the growing availability of privacy coins like Monero and Zcash, criminals continue to use Bitcoin because of the abundance of Bitcoin-to-fiat offramps. Banks and money service businesses should pay attention to high-risk transactions originating from BATMs that lack proper AML compliance.”

Bitcoin cleaner than fiat?

Even though the crypto sector is still routinely maligned by members of the mainstream media that claim that digital currencies are still, by and large, being used by bad actors for nefarious reasons — such as terrorist financing, drug trade, etc. — Jefferies told Cointelegraph that as per his company’s latest research, cryptocurrencies are considerably cleaner than their reputation would suggest:

“The reality is that criminal use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very low, less than 0.2% of the funds accepted by exchanges is directly from criminal sources.”

In a recent tweet, Dedic says he expects the crypto market to launch another bull market but warns that the rising tide will not lift all boats. The founder of digital asset intelligence firm Blockfyre predicts that Bitcoin will soar nearly 1,500% to $150,000 in a new bull cycle.

But unlike the peak of the 2017 crypto bull market, when many altcoins generated gains of over 1,000%, the Blockfyre executive believes only a handful of altcoins will print potentially life-changing gains.

At the top of Dedic’s altcoin’s list is Ethereum (ETH). He expects the second-largest cryptocurrency to skyrocket to $9,000 for an increase of 3,650% from its current price of $240.

Dedic expects Chainlink (LINK), which is trading at $4.34 at time of writing, to surge over 4,500% to $200. He also believes Binance Coin (BNB) will soar to $500 and post gains of more than 2,700% from its current value of $17.64.

Next is VeChain (VET), which he predicts will rise almost 15,000% from its current price of $0.006682 to $1.00.

Wrapping up the venture capitalist’s list is Tezos (XTZ). Dedic says he believes XTZ, which is currently valued at $2.91, will generate gains of more than 6,700% as it climbs to $200.

The altcoin market is especially risky, with many coins remaining down more than 90% from their all-time highs in the last parabolic crypto rally, which ended in December of 2017.

Bitcoin is trading at $9,597.67 at time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap.",2020-06-07 00:00:00,https://www.ibtimes.com/bitcoin-price-hit-150000-ethereum-9000-next-bull-run-blockfyre-founder-predicts-2989587,"KEY POINTS Crypto analyst predicts Ethereum and 3 more altcoins will have a price rally along with Bitcoin

All these altcoins had either important announcements or development milestones about to be achieved

Bitcoin is still the one to watch, with Bloomberg predicting a $20k price in 2020

For BlockFyre founder Simon Dedic, the next bull run will return with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge. However, only a handful of altcoins will join the crypto rally.

In a tweet, Dedic said 2017 was the year when buying any altcoin was a good investment. Altcoins mean all coins that are not BTC, and all benefited from the bull ride. The year 2017 was when BTC’s phenomenal price rally happened, starting at $998.33 on Jan. 1 and peeking at $19,783 on Dec. 17. Ethereum (ETH) started at $8.17 in January and ended the year at $756.73. NEM (XEM), for example, was priced $0.003 in December 2016 but was $1.03 by December 2017.

By February 2018, most coins had already peaked, and BTC went into a 2-year-long bear rally. While BTC is at 50% below its all-time high, the majority of altcoins never recovered. Even ETH, sitting at $244 as of June 6, 2020, is still 82% below its peak of $1,395 in January 2017.

Dedic said on Twitter that the kind of bull run experienced in 2017 will not happen again. However, he made the case for the “few solid altcoins” out there. He believes ETH, Chainlink (LINK), Binance Coin (BNB), VeChain (VET), and Tezos (XTZ) will have price rallies along with BTC. The analyst went as far as putting a price in his predictions:

Bitcoin - $150k

Ethereum - $9k

Chainlink - $200

Binance Coin - $500

VeChain - $1

Tezos - $200

At $150k, Dedic is predicting a 1,437% increase in BTC’s price, which is sitting at $9,758 as of June 8. The $9k prediction on ETH represents an increase of 3,588% from the current average daily prices. The coin with the largest increase based on Dedic’s predictions is VET. It ranks no. 29 in CoinMarketCap with a price of $0.007281. Dedic sees a 13,000% increase in this altcoin.

The altcoins mentioned by Dedic either have had important developments in recent months or will have upcoming development milestone. ETH, for example, is about to switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mechanism. ETH holders will be able to stake their tokens as collateral to be able to verify transactions on the network in exchange for staking rewards.

In June 2019, LINK secured its biggest partner, Google, which will use the former’s “oracle” to integrate cryptocurrency data to the search engine’s numerous software, including to BigQuery. The news ignited a price rally that saw LINK reaching $3.60 apiece. LINK went through numerous upward and downward trends, but never returned to its price pre-Google partnership announcement.

BNB is the token of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume according to Coinmarketcap, a price and data aggregator tool that the exchange acquired in 2020. The acquisition sparked criticism on Binance’s owner Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and concerns on Coinmarketcap’s independence were raised. BNB, which acts as the primary token on Binance, gives benefits to its holders, including reduced fees when trading and the ability to participate in initial exchange offerings.

VET had numerous partnerships, including a tie-up with Shanghai Gas, the 150-year-old gas company in China for supply chain monitoring. It is also partnered with fashion company H&M for supply chain tracking.

XTZ, currently top 11 on Coinmarketcap has recently partnered with Banco BTG Pactual for issuing Real Estate Tokens on the Blockchain. Tezos’ big win is when it was integrated by crypto startup Digycode to support XTZ payments through vouchers and gift cards.

While Dedic predicted these altcoins to have incredible price value in the next bull run, it is clear Bitcoin is the one to watch. Bitcoin sits at $9,500 level weeks after its third halving. Multiple analysts, including Bloomberg, predicts a revisit to $20k levels in 2020.",2020-06-07 23:21:12-04:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-eth-link-ada-etc,"When the price of an asset does not reverse direction from a critical resistance, it indicates that some traders are holding onto their positions in anticipation of a breakout. For the past month, Bitcoin (BTC) has been repeatedly revisiting the $10,000 levels and even though the bulls have not been able to sustain above this level, they have not given up much ground either.

This suggests that traders are accumulating on dips and not closing their positions at $10,000. This is a bullish sign and it increases the possibility of a breakout above the resistance in the short-term.

Before and after the halving, institutional investors have also been building larger Bitcoin positions. As reported by Cointelegraph, crypto fund manager Grayscale has aggressively been buying the top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap and recent reporting shows they also purchased about $110 million worth of Ether (ETH). This strong inflow of funds into the top two cryptocurrencies bodes well for the sector.

The next few days are critical as they will determine whether the crypto market will trend higher or take a break. If Bitcoin rises, these other crypto assets could offer a buying opportunity.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) is at a critical juncture. On June 1, the bulls propelled the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. However, due to lack of follow up buying, the price dipped back into the triangle on June 2.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Since then, the BTC/USD pair has been trading between the 20-day simple moving average ($9,423) and the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. This suggests buying on dips at lower levels.

If the bulls can push the price above the triangle once again, a rally to $10,500 is possible. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively but if the bulls can scale it, a new uptrend is likely. The pattern target of a breakout of the triangle is $11,778.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the 20-day SMA. In such a case, a drop to the support line of the symmetrical triangle is possible. Below the triangle, a drop to $8,130.58 is likely. However, the probability of such a fall remains low.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The four-hour chart shows that the bulls were able to drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle on two occasions but they could not build up on the breakout. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.

However, on the downside, the bulls are not allowing the sellers to sink the price to the support line of the triangle. This is a positive sign. If the price rebounds off the current levels, the bulls are likely to make one more attempt to push the price above the triangle.

If successful, the pair is likely to move up to $10,400–$10,500. Therefore, traders may look for entries above $9,900 and a stop-loss at $9,500. Taking partial profits closer to $10,500 might be wise if the pair struggles to break free of this resistance and the stops on the rest of the position can be kept at breakeven.

If the pair ascends $10,500 levels, it could start the next leg of the sustained up move.

Conversely, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $9,400, a drop to $9,200 is likely. The bulls will make an aggressive attempt to defend this support zone because if it gives way, a deeper correction is possible.

ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) is in an uptrend and has been trading inside the ascending channel for the past few weeks. Currently, the price is stuck between the 10-day exponential moving average ($235) and the downtrend line.

ETH/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If the second-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap bounces off the 10-day EMA and breaks out of the downtrend line, the uptrend is likely to continue.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 10-day EMA, a drop to the 20-day SMA ($223) is possible. However, as the bulls have held the support line of the channel on three previous occasions (marked as ellipse on the chart), a bounce off it can also offer a buying opportunity to the traders.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line while the bulls are attempting to keep the ETH/USD pair above $236. If the pair slips below $236, it can drop to $229 and then to the support line of the ascending channel.

If the pair bounces off the support line of the ascending channel, it can offer a buying opportunity to the traders with a close stop-loss kept just below the channel.

Another buying opportunity will open up if the pair bounces off $236 and breaks out of the downtrend line. Traders will likely buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line with a stop-loss below $229. The first target on the upside is $252 and then $270.

A change in trend is likely to be signaled if the pair plummets below the channel. Therefore, bullish positions below the channel should be avoided.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) broke out of an ascending triangle on June 1. The pattern target of this bullish breakout is $4.9656. However, the altcoin turned around from $4.6185 and is currently retesting the breakout level.

LINK/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the 14th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap bounces off the 10-day EMA ($4.27) or the breakout level of $4.2129, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move. The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.

Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below the breakout level, a drop to the 20-day SMA ($4.11) and then to the trendline of the triangle is possible. A breakdown of the triangle will be a negative sign that will signal a possible change in trend from bullish to range-bound.

LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The four-hour chart suggests that the bulls are struggling to hold on to the higher levels. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI has also dipped into the negative territory, which suggests that bears are attempting to make a comeback in the short-term.

However, the bulls are likely to step in and defend the breakout level of $4.2129 aggressively. If the rebound off this support rises above the downtrend line it will signal a possible resumption of the uptrend.

Opening a position above the downtrend line and keeping a stop-loss below $4.10 might be a reasonable trade setup. The first target objective would be a rally to $4.6185, then $4.9656.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the LINK/USD pair below the trendline of the ascending triangle.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days. If the trend is strong, the bulls usually buy the dips to the 10-day EMA ($0.079). Even if this level is broken, the possibility of a bounce off the 20-day SMA ($0.068) remains high.

ADA/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Currently, the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is witnessing profit booking. However, both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls remain in command.

Therefore, if the price bounces off the 10-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to reach the stiff overhead resistance at $0.10. In the past, this level has acted as a strong resistance, hence, the bears are likely to defend it aggressively once again.

If the 10-day EMA breaks down, a deeper correction to the 20-day SMA is possible. Such a fall would signal weakening momentum and increase the likelihood of a range formation for a few days.

ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The four-hour chart shows that the bulls are defending the zone between $0.0839747–$0.0832290 but are struggling to propel the ADA/USD pair above the downtrend line. This suggests that the bears are posing stiff resistance at higher levels.

If the pair rebounds off the current levels and rallies above $0.0901373, it is likely to resume its uptrend. Traders might look at buying half the desired position size after the pair closes (UTC time) above the moving averages and the rest of the position can be added above $0.0901373.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $0.0832, a drop to 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.0810950 and then to 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.0789610 is possible. A strong bounce off these levels could also offer a buying opportunity with a close stop-loss.

The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $0.0789610. Below this support, a drop to $0.0759228 and then to $0.0720527 is possible.

ETC/USD

Ethereum Classic (ETC) turned down at the overhead resistance of $7.62717 on May 31. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. Currently, the altcoin has dropped to the trendline of the ascending triangle.

If the 20th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap rebounds off the trendline support, the bulls will probably attempt to push the price back towards $7.62717. A breakout of this level will be a huge positive as it will complete an ascending triangle pattern.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the trendline, a deeper pullback is likely. Below the trendline, a drop to $6 and below it to $5.50 is possible. The 10-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the RSI is just below the 50 level, which suggests that bears are trying to make a comeback.

ETC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The ETC/USD pair has dropped to the trendline of the ascending triangle. If the pair bounces off this level and rises above $7, traders can initiate long positions with a stop-loss below the trendline.

Traders may look to book partial profits close to $7.60 and trail the rest with a close stop-loss because if the momentum can drive the price above $7.62 the ascending triangle will complete. This bullish setup has a target objective of $9.74.

Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the pair below the trendline, it will signal weakness. Therefore, traders should avoid buying when the price stays below the trendline.

Will The Bahamas Remain an Attractive Jurisdiction Post Leverage Caps?

Last week, Finance Magnates broke the exclusive news that the Securities Commission of The Bahamas will be implementing a range of new regulations, including leverage restrictions and placing a ban on binary options trading for retail traders.

We asked and tried to answer the important questions like what type of after-effects might these new regulations have? Will The Bahamas still be a go-to destination for traders and brokers in search of higher leverage, or will it change the role the country plays within the global FX market?

Read the Bahamas Regulation Change analysis here.",2020-06-07 14:15:43+00:00,https://decrypt.co/31510/take-aways-from-chinas-biggest-crypto-mining-conference,"Every year in May, Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan province, welcomes hundreds of crypto miners for a few days of intense networking during its Global Mining Forum. The premier event hosts mining rig producers and mining farm managers—and, increasingly, also asset managers and exchanges as they venture into the mining business.

This year’s conference, the first one since the Bitcoin halving last month, was well-attended. Yet, it remains rather mysterious to outsiders, as many of us, including your correspondent, are dutifully quarantining at home. This week’s da bing takes a look at the Forum and teases out a few takeaways.

The financialization of mining

Mining isn’t simply about buying rigs and finding cheap electricity anymore. Rather, the value chain has expanded to include financial services. Panel and keynote speakers aren’t simply Bitcoin veterans from mining pools and rig producers. Instead, a “new wave” of influencers come from companies that provide financing, hedging and derivative services to miners.

“The conference made it even clearer that financialization is an unavoidable trend in the mining sector,” Mable Jiang, Principle of Multicoin Capital, told me. “Just look at FTX— they’ve launched a hashrate derivative trading tool that allows miners to hedge against mining difficulty.”

As Bitcoin halved, mining rewards declined, which forced some miners to come up with new ways to finance their operations. “Many mining farm managers are having a hard time recruiting this year,” said Molly Mo, who runs marketing at Hashkey Hub, a digital asset management platform. “As small miners went out of business in recent months, big mining farms can’t meet their quota as easily because normally, small miners join forces with big miners to reduce costs.”

As business declines, mining farms have to improve their financing literacy in order to stay afloat.

Filecoin continues to be a hit

Despite recent security vulnerabilities found on Filecoin’s testnet, Chinese miners continue to stand behind the decentralized storage project. (UPDATE: Filecoin is currently conducting a security audit to deal with any issues, a spokesperson said after this story was published.) One conference attendee told me that “filecoin is everywhere.” Indeed, for those who are close to China’s crypto circle, the buying and selling of filecoin mining rigs has caught many people’s attention—and wallet. According to one report, there are more than 200 filecoin mining rig producers in China, selling over a billion RMB.

Institutional investors are just as interested in Filecoin as retail investors. During the Forum, T01475, a large and activist IPFS node (it was the one that reported the recent security issue, in fact) received investment from HashKey Capital and Fenbushi. Both are OG crypto VCs in China.

The injection of new capital to thriving Chinese IPFS nodes is the latest example of a western blockchain product gaining momentum in China.

The real hotpot: mining, trading and financing, all in one

Chengdu is famous for its hotpot, so is the crypto sector. “Compared to a few years ago when only miners participated in the conference, this year, everyone went,” said Mo. The wide diversity of people from all sectors of the crypto industry who attended the mining forum reflects another big trend happening: everyone wants to do everything.

“Exchanges were everywhere during the Forum,” Jiang said, “ they have made a fortune from the trading side of their business, and are now pushing aggressively toward mining.”

In addition to exchanges, VCs—mainly Chinese— are investing in mining and laying out strategies to set up mining farms and serve miners. I’m told that many traditional investors who typically wouldn’t invest in mining farms directly, are doing so in recent months. Many Chinese investors have also gone abroad to North America to invest.

Why? Because mining is not only the top of the crypto value chain, it’s also one of the few verticals that consistently produces profits. It’s no wonder that one cannot understand crypto without understanding mining. And look nowhere other than Chengdu when you need a taste of the crypto hotpot.

Three other things that happened this week

#1. Hainan said it’s not a big fan of crypto, after all

After making a few headlines on its island-wide blockchain strategy, Hainan went quiet for a few months. Despite occasional news about the island testing yet another blockchain-enabled use case and developing local blockchain expertise, nothing ground-breaking has come out of the island.

This dilemma might last for a bit longer, as Hainan issued a statement further asserting its blockchain-not-crypto policy. In the new report, not only was “crypto“ never mentioned, the words “digital yuan” were also absent. It seems that Hainan wants to brush off any traces of virtual currency from its image.

The reason might be due to Hainan’s hesitation in firming up the island’s overall financial policy. Many have speculated about whether Hainan ultimately becomes an open island, in which the Chinese government will allow crypto exchanges to legally exist. So far though, despite the frequent and noteworthy visits of Huobi CEO Leon Li, the island still seems a ways away from taking crypto mainstream.

#2. Blockchain vulnerability database: loopholes, scams, plus crypto news sites

In Jan 2020, the government, with help from Chinese tech firms, started the China National Vulnerability Database, an open database of security loopholes. The project was a low-key affair, until June 3, when it announced its go-live date—and revealed a number of bugs that still need to be sorted.

The database listed 247 security loopholes, among which it deemed 60 as high risk, 173 moderate risk and 14 low risk. A closer look at the database reveals that the site not only includes security loopholes of random ERC20 tokens, but also crypto news, especially scams, collected from both domestic and international news sites.

The site might not be relevant to many but it does show China is keeping a close eye on the industry.

#3. BlockVC’s Troy scandal

It’s rare that a week goes by in China’s crypto circle without some sort of scandal. This week, the center of the drama was Feng Wang, founder of Mars Finance, and his interactions with BlockVC, a crypto investment firm notorious for its shenanigans.

The short story is that Wang publicly accused BlockVC of manipulating investors (such as himself) into investing in a Binance IEO project called “Troy,” which performed poorly in 2019.

Yet, two days after last week's attacks, Wang, using the most amicable language, issued a statement describing the “robust trust” between the two organizations.

Many speculated that Wang got part of his funds back from BlockVC and therefore backed off. The farce just showed clearly how manipulative crypto investment in China can be.

Do you know？

As China struggles to recover economically from Coronavirus, prime minister Keqiang Li suggested the country revive the good old “street market,” where illegal vendors open up shops, literally on the roads. The goal is to stimulate the economy. As a result, crypto firms also went on the street, and participated in the movement. Many are directly selling crypto, others are advertising financial derivatives, wallets, company swag, or simply sitting on the street with a cardboard sign emblazoned with their company logos.",2020-06-07 15:31:00,https://www.coindesk.com/people/patrick-byrne,"Patrick Byrne was the CEO of Overstock.com, one of the earliest online retailers to accept bitcoin as payment. Overstock.com is the parent company of blockchain investment firm Medici Ventures and capital markets platform tZERO.

Byrne bought Deals.com in 1999 and rebranded the international retailer to Overstock.com. In its early years, Overstock.com gained a reputation for bargain prices and “steals,” which led to early success earning $25.5 million in year two and $80 million in year three. In 2002, Overstock.com went public and earned nearly $100 million in gross revenues.

In 2014, Overstock began offering their products in exchange for bitcoin. While missing their sales mark in the first few years, this exposed the retailer to a new customer base, 50% of bitcoin sales were completed by customers who had previously not shopped at Overstock.com. In 2014, Byrne launched Overstock.com’s subsidiary investment firm Medici Ventures. Byrne had become an outspoken advocate of bitcoin, even installing a Bitcoin ATM at Overstock’s headquarters in 2015. That year, Byrne directly invested $8 million in different blockchain projects.

Medici Ventures has become a notable venture firm in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, having funded voting solution Voatz, asset manager Chainstone Labs, data authenticator Factom and banking platform Bankorus. Additionally, Byrne’s often promoted subsidiary, tZERO, aims to be a blockchain-based securities market that disrupts traditional Wall Street practices. As of February 2019, the platform had struggled in its initial phases regarding volume expectation and price of their initial coin offering (ICO) token, TZROP. The platform remains restricted to certain users and tradeable tokens.",,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/the-crypto-daily-movers-and-shakers-07-06-20-653767,"Steering clear of the first major support level at $9,538.6, Bitcoin rallied to a midday intraday high $9,742.3 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $9,784.0, Bitcoin slid back to sub-$9,600 levels before briefly revisiting $9,700 levels.

Resistance at $9,700 ultimately pinned Bitcoin back late in the day to limit the upside on the day.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the mixed week.

For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was another mixed day for the majors on Saturday.

Stellar’s Lumen rose by 1.64% to lead the way on the day.

Cardano’s ADA (+0.40%), Ethereum (+0.81%), Monero’s XMR (+0.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+0.57%), and Tron’s TRX (+0.94%) also avoided the red.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors. Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 1.32% to lead the way down.

Binance Coin (-0.74%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.28%), EOS (-0.53%), and Tezos (-0.24%) also saw red, while Litecoin ended the day flat.

According to Glassnode, on June 6, the total amount in fees spent on the Ethereum network added up to $498,000, compared to Bitcoin’s $308,000. The gap continued to widen the next day, totalling $540,000 and $258,000 represectively.

The “feepening”

This is the second time Ethereum network fees have topped Bitcoin’s this year. On March 12, there was a sudden spike in Ethereum network fees, which totalled almost $800,000, greatly exceeding the amount paid by Bitcoin users on the same day. The Ethereum network was experiencing major congestion at the time, which likely prompted users to pay more fees for their transactions.

This time around, the reasons behind what Twitter commentators are calling the “feepeninig” seem similar.

First, Bitcoin’s mempool has recently been cleared as a result of the latest difficulty adjustment, which took place on Thursday. The lack of pending transactions has greatly reduced transaction fees on the network, which have dropped to the $1 mark. For comparison, on May 20, an average Bitcoin transaction could cost up to $6.6 due to the post-halving state of the network.

Ethereum’s mempool is currently clogged, with over 103,000 transactions pending, which partly explains the latest network fees numbers. Moreover, stablecoin transfer value has been hitting new records this year, suggesting that stablecoins — most of which, like Tether (USDT), Paxos (PAX) and USD Coin (USDC), operate on the Ethereum network — have greatly contributed to the network activity.

Ethereum 2.0 will address scalability issues

Ethereum developers aim to address the scalability problem in the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, scheduled for sometime in July.

Specifically, the network will move on to a Proof-of-Stake, or PoS, consensus — meaning that asset holders, called stakers, will be responsible for network validation instead of miners. Curiously, last week, an anonymous user dropped an ETH 2.0 scaling solution on Medium.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-founder-charles-hoskinson-calls-crypto-a-political-movement,"Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano (ADA), has described participating in cryptocurrency as an inherently political act.

Speaking during an impromptu ask-me-anything on YouTube, Hoskinson asserted that crypto-driven fundamental disruptions to monetary relations will not come without struggle, placing the crypto phenomenon within the political arena.

Hoskinson also urged members of the crypto community to take a stand against increasing regulatory moves to crack down on encryption.

Crypto is inherently political

In the AMA streamed on June 5, Charles Hoskinson proclaimed that “Crypto is a political movement.”

""Crypto is as political as it gets,” he said. “We’re going to reinvent the concept of money and take it out of the government’s hands and control it ourselves.”

Hoskinson emphasized that the cryptocurrency phenomenon is especially political by nature due to the creative destruction it seeks to bring upon monetary commodities and policy, stating that “money is the biggest influence of all of politics.”

Considering the consequences of the wholesale adoption of distributed ledger technologies, Hoskinson noted that the impacts of cryptocurrency will reach far beyond the domain of money, stating:

“Everything has to change: trade changes, property rights change, business change, the business structure changes, laws change.”

Regulators move against encryption

Hoskinson predicted that crypto assets will face increasing hostility from regulators, saying, “There are people in the Senate and the Congress today in the United States and all around the world who want to ban crypto.”

The Cardano creator urged the crypto community to fight against regulatory efforts to constrain crypto, stating, “If you’re in this industry, what do you do? Do you just roll over like a dead dog and say, ‘It was a lot of fun okay, alright, whatever.’ No, I’m sorry, You have to have an opinion. You have to fight for the right things.”

“Right now, there’s a strong movement to ban encryption so that when you have encryption, you need to have a backdoor in the system,” asserted Hoskinson.

“Will you guys use Cardano if it has backdoors in it and we designed the system that way and some small group of people have control over your money and at any time can freeze it? How many of you would use that?” he asked.",,https://www.laprogressive.com/bitcoin-cryptocurrency/,"You have traded stocks. What are the other trading opportunities to try this year?

Cryptocurrencies are the revolutionary digital alternatives to the physical currencies regulated by the central banks around the world. Unlike traditional currencies like dollars, pounds, or euros, cryptocurrencies can’t be converted to cash. However, they can be bought, exchanged, and traded on specialist platforms available online. The currencies themselves only exist digitally, with all the ownership information stored in encrypted ledgers.

The first successful cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and it was launched back in 2009. Within a couple of years, a few other cryptocurrencies were introduced, making the possibility of exchanging the digital currencies with one another. It works similarly to the traditional stock and forex markets and requires the use of a cryptocurrency exchange. On some platforms, you can also exchange or trade cryptocurrencies against dollars.

Trading and Exchanging Cryptocurrencies

Between 2017 to 2018, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc. saw a massive surge in interests from investors, which eventually pushed the Bitcoin value to as high as $20,000 each. It came down to $3,000 level in the following year, and now, experiencing a slow but steady upturn.

As you can see, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. Their value goes up and down on a massive scale and is prone to speculative news and information.

Latest Forecasts on Major Cryptocurrencies

At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) the most important cryptocurrency in terms of value is moving in the $9,000 marks, while Ethereum (ETH) is moving in and around $200. So, borsainside.com, tells us what lies ahead for the top three digital currencies in terms of value.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD)

After the halving in the second week of May this year, Bitcoin prices are experiencing some optimism from the investors. The price is moving just above $9,000 levels. With some analysts predicting a nine percent chance for the price to reach an all-time high, investors should be looking at the $10,050 level, breaking through which may lead to a consistent upward movement for a few days.

Ethereum (ETH/USD)

In light of Bitcoin halving and the launching possibility of Ethereum 2.0; analysts are mainly bullish about this coin’s value. If it holds the $190 level, and push upwards, all the technical signs suggest for the value to reach between $330 to $360, the level previously seen in 2019.

Ripple (XRP/USD)

December last year saw the value of XRP drop by a mammoth 13%. While it somewhat recovered at the beginning of this year, the value continues to move around $0.15 – $0.20. Analysts see some more downward movements, which may turn bullish only if it reaches $0.28 mark.",2020-06-08 12:54:04+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-10000-remains-bitcoins-price-to-beat,"It was $10,000 or bust as bitcoin traded unremarkably for much of Monday.

At 00:00 UTC on Monday (8:00 p.m. Sunday ET), bitcoin was changing hands ataround $9,760 on spot exchanges including Coinbase. The price has stayed more or less in a range between $9,600 and 9,700, keeping bitcoin above its 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator. This sentiment was helped by large volumes of trading Sunday, when prices rallied from below $9,400 to as high as $9,800.

On a relatively quiet Monday, many traders continue to view a break above $10,000 as the make-or-break signal on bitcoin’s continued strength.

“The market looks calm and the volume in the top-tier spot exchange volume is pretty low,” said Sasha Goldberg, a senior trading specialist for crypto firm Efficient Frontier. “We are close to the $10,000 limit,” he added. “If bitcoin is not able to go above that level and stay there, it’s possible that we’ll see a pullback to the $8,000 level.”

Despite the lack of action, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has made very positive gains overall in 2020, said Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency trader and founder of educational platform BlockRoots. “Bitcoin is still near $10,000. Just because it’s not pumping, it’s still performing well,” he said.

Since the start of 2020, bitcoin has appreciated over 35%, while gold is up 11% and the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks is flat, back to where it was at the start of the year.

“Friday’s incredibly positive U.S. nonfarm payrolls number has led to the largest divergence between Gold and S&P 500 prices since the March lows,” said Singapore-based QCP Capital in an investor note.

Rager, the crypto trader, sees stocks being in the green as a temporary condition. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more pumps on stocks and then another major pullback,” he added.

Other markets

Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mixed Monday.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading around $242 and is flat, up less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). It’s performing similar to bitcoin Monday, but can that last? Jack Tan, managing partner of Taiwan-based trading firm Kronos Research, thinks ether could do better in the long term. “At this point, we feel that ether is more or less correlated with bitcoin. However, ether might slightly outperform bitcoin going forth,” he said.

The seven-day moving average of the total amount of bitcoin held in exchange addresses declined to 2,313,749 on Sunday – the lowest level since December 2018, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

Exchange balances have declined by nearly 13% over the last four months – a change indicative of a shift to a long-term holding strategy. “This could be related to more investors HODLing [holding], moving their funds to cold storage and/or keys they control themselves,” cryptocurrency exchange Luno noted in a weekly email update.

Investors tend to move cryptocurrency from their wallets to exchanges to be able to more quickly liquidate holdings during a price crash or when they expect a price rally to be short-lived.

However, bitcoin’s price rise from the March low of $3,867 has been accompanied by a decline in exchange balances.

Further, the metric has been dropping over the last four weeks despite the cryptocurrency’s repeated failure to establish a strong foothold above $10,000 and lackluster, range-bound trading.

As such, it seems likely investors expect the ongoing price consolidation to pave the way for a stronger bull run and are holding on to their investments in the hope of bigger gains to come.

The prospects of a continued upward move look strong, as the diverging trends in bitcoin’s price and exchange balances seen this year are the opposite of what we saw in the second quarter of 2019. At that time, exchange balances rose along with prices, suggesting a lack of confidence in a longer rally.

As the cryptocurrency rallied from $7,900 to $13,800 in the five weeks to June 26, 2019, the seven-day moving average of exchange balances increased by nearly 6%. But bitcoin’s uptrend ran out of steam in the following two weeks, and prices had dropped to $8,000 by the end of September. The slide continued in the fourth quarter with prices hitting lows below $6,500.

This time round, it seems, investors are more confident.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,750, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The cryptocurrency has defended sub-$9,400 levels multiple times in the last four days. The repeated dip demand, coupled with bullish developments on the longer duration technical charts suggest the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

“Long-term momentum analysis is definitely upside-oriented in my opinion. [The] monthly Stochastic oscillator has just crossed over in a bullish banner after almost a year of bearish impact,” said Adrian Zdunczyk, a chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest.",2020-06-08 12:23:29+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/returns-for-bitcoins-forks-have-trounced-bitcoin-this-year,"While bitcoin has outperformed gold and the S&P 500 index in 2020, data shows even better returns among leading bitcoin “fork” cryptocurrencies.

These cryptocurrencies are created by copying the Bitcoin source code repository through a process called “forking.” Developers then adjust certain parameters and features in the copied code to create a similar but distinct protocol. According to data from Messari, the three largest bitcoin (BTC) forks by market capitalization are bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin sv (BSV), and bitcoin gold (BTG).

Using an equal-weighted index of the four cryptocurrencies the returns are almost 3.5 times greater than bitcoin alone for the year to date, based on TradingView data. Since the beginning of 2019, moreover, this index outperformed bitcoin by a total of 435 percentage points. An equal-weighted index of just the top three bitcoin forks returned gains 3.1 times greater than bitcoin, year to date.

Individually, bitcoin sv and bitcoin gold have outperformed bitcoin by 61 and 37 percentage points, respectively, since the start of 2020. Bitcoin cash outperformed bitcoin until May. Year to date, the largest bitcoin fork has underperformed bitcoin by 11 percentage points, according to TradingView data.

Some analysts aren’t surprised by these returns. Cryptocurrencies with low and middle market capitalizations like these bitcoin forks “tend to outperform bitcoin during marketwide bull runs,” said Aditya Das, market analyst at research firm Brave New Coin. Similar trends were observed during the 2017 bullish market cycle, he explained. The miner subsidy for bitcoin and its forks also halved this year, an event that occurs once every four years and is a bullish catalyst for some investors.

These returns are mostly attributable to a strong positive correlation with bitcoin’s price inflation combined with higher volatility, according to Louis Liu, founder and CIO at Mimesis Capital. Nonetheless, there is “definitely alpha” in bitcoin forks, he said, referring to the excess returns. However, he says they were not the result of fundamental value added by improving on bitcoin.

As is usually the case, greater returns come with increased risk. Liquidity is one such concern, Das explained.

Only two of the industry’s largest exchanges by traded volume, Binance and Bitfinex, support markets for all three top bitcoin forks, according to Nomics. Moreover, the largest bitcoin cash spot market, supported by Binance, is only one-tenth the size of the largest bitcoin market, also on Binance.

Forks such as bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv are “likely being used purely as speculative instruments,” said Kevin Kelly, former equity analyst at Bloomberg and co-founder of digital asset research firm Delphi Digital.

What’s more, he added, “the liquidity profile and long-term value proposition” of bitcoin forks is “drastically different, if even existent, when compared to bitcoin.”",2020-06-08 18:03:01+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/illegal-bitcoin-mining-cost-russia-6-6-million-in-3-years/,"Illegal cryptocurrency mining facilities in Russia have stolen electricity worth almost 450 million rubles ($6.6 million) over the past three years, according to the state-owned power grid Rosseti.

The figures were first reported by the grid operator on Telegram and revealed the high cost of “black” mining on its business.

According to the company, the estimates came from illegal mining operations, tempered power meters, and underground mining farms.

The electricity distributor pointed out that many existing businesses in Russia run cryptocurrency mining operations in factories, offices, remote houses, and even in farms only to generate an additional source of income.

These businesses do not have any contract with the local power distributors and are using electricity for Bitcoin mining without paying for it. Rosseti is now hunting for such illegal operations, yet the losses made over the past few years were staggering.

The company also detailed that many facilities just hook a wire to the nearest power lines, stealing electricity, whereas a few even hide their mining equipment underground in the forests to avoid enforcement crackdowns.

Since 2017, Rosseti has found 35 cases of such illegal cryptocurrency mining facilities across 20 regions of the country.

Can regulations curb illegal mining?

Illegal crypto mining has been a headache for the authorities for years. As the price of Bitcoin surges, many jump into mining the digital currency, and to book more profits often try to bypass the electricity costs.

From South Korea to United States, and from China to Ukraine, almost all the countries have seen large scale illegal Bitcoin mining operations.

Last December, the Chinese authorities seized 7,000 illegal Bitcoin miners in a crackdown. The same month, Russian law enforcement also prosecuted two persons for illegally mining Bitcoins on government computers.",2020-06-08 12:19:04+00:00,https://azbigmedia.com/business/what-cryptocurrency-means-for-small-businesses/,"For most people, ask them what they know about cryptocurrency and their answer will be probably be that there’s one called Bitcoin and that, a few years ago, it saw a huge surge in value. While this may be true, there’s a lot more to cryptocurrencies than just that one fact about one particular currency.

What it overlooks is that cryptocurrencies offer several advantages that can benefit small businesses in a number of ways. Why small businesses in particular? That’s because they are small enough and flexible enough to incorporate new ideas like cryptocurrencies and it can give them some distinct advantages over their competitors.

The most obvious way that any small enterprise can benefit is by starting to accept payment in cryptocurrencies for their goods and services. For a start, when more payment options are offered, it creates additional appeal for customers, both in the B2B and B2C arenas. It also presents any small business as one which is forward-thinking and keen to use the latest payment methods.

Then there are the low charges that apply to the majority of cryptocurrency transactions. Traditional transaction fees can prove to be a major expense, especially if you deal with overseas orders in which two currencies need to be used. In this case, there’s the added advantage that no currency conversion will ever need to be made.

Finally, there’s both the speed and security that cryptocurrency transactions have built into them. Where banks can take days to process some payments, the blockchain behind cryptocurrencies means that they can be completed in a matter of minutes, if not seconds. Then, the fact that transactions are verified and irreversible makes them super secure.

These are all reasons that everywhere from big organizations like Starbucks down to small independent coffee shops have started to welcome Bitcoin, in particular, as a method of payment.

The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin has a great deal to do with the growing familiarity among people with the concept of trading the cryptocurrency. There is an ever-growing number of online trading robots emerging that automate the process. There are so many, in fact, that comparison sites like Inside Bitcoins have also started to spring up to give reviews of the relative merits and drawbacks of a bot like Bitcoin Revolution, which offers a demo account and tutorials for beginners. This is essential reading if your small business is interested in dabbling in investing too.

However, before any small business does decide to adopt cryptocurrencies either as a method of payment or an investment opportunity, it’s important to recognize that they remain fairly volatile. This is good news when the price changes work in your favor, less good when they don’t. But provided you can take a long-term view and are prepared to wait for positive price rises before converting the money back into a fiat currency, this won’t be an issue.

So, for any forward-thinking small business owner, it definitely worth considering Bitcoin as an additional payment option – and one that is certain to become more popular as time goes on.",2020-06-08 11:00:32+00:00

Since January, ether’s price performance has been steadily outpacing that of bitcoin (BTC). With over 90% in gains since 2020 started, ether holders are beating bitcoin investors because the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up by just over 30% since January.

Ether versus bitcoin in 2020 Source: TradingView

One of the reasons for ether’s boost is the increasing use of decentralized finance, or DeFi, said Peter Chan, a trader for Hong Kong-based crypto firm OneBit Quant. DeFi is used for lending and trading, including derivatives, using the Ethereum network’s smart contract technology instead of third parties providing centralized software.

“This explains why we see bigger pumps on ether than bitcoin when the market moves upwards,” Chan added. “Ethereum is evolving much faster than bitcoin with the rapid growth in DeFi.”

Indeed, while dipping considerably during March’s market crash, the amount of U.S. dollar value locked in DeFi has recently surpassed $1 billion once again.

While the amount of price appreciation may have diverged, both bitcoin and ether markets seem to operate in tandem. Since the start of 2020, ether and bitcoin have been heavily correlated.

“With insight, ether has been a better investment than bitcoin from a pure performance point of view so far this year,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at Paris-based quant firm ExoAlpha. “But on the downside, they both behaved identically on downward slides.”

Sasha Goldberg, a senior trading specialist for crypto firm Efficient Frontier, notes ether may rise more than bitcoin but has also dropped more than it, too. “Although it seems that ether outperforms bitcoin, when you look at the bigger picture, bitcoin is down 51% from its all time high while ether is down 83%,” he said.

In early 2018, bitcoin traded around $17,900 on spot exchanges on the day ether touched its all-time high of $1,432. The bigger question may be which one has the highest price ceiling the next time crypto prices break out as they did in late 2017.

“Investors get the benefit of trading and owning bitcoin through a regulated security, while having the option to redeem bitcoin if they choose,” said Bradley Duke, CEO of ETC Group, in a press statement emailed to CoinDesk.

“It really is a hybrid ETP product that has the same features as an ETF [exchange-traded product]. Because it’s a single asset instrument it doesn’t qualify to be an ETF according to the European fund regime,” explained ETC in an emailed statement.

The novel security is also bound to cost slightly more than traditional ETFs, with an expense ratio of 2% compared to anywhere between 0.5 to 0.7% charged by most ETFs.

The company operates a peer-to-peer, crypto-enabled business that allows individuals anywhere in the world to invest in solar infrastructure in Africa.

How’s that all work?

“You as an individual are selling electricity to a school in South Africa, via a solar panel you bought through the Sun Exchange,” explained Abe Cambridge, the startup’s founder and CEO.

“Our platform meters the electricity production of your solar panel. Arranges for the purchasing of that electricity with your chosen energy consumer, collects that money and then returns it to your Sun Exchange wallet.”

It costs roughly $5 a solar cell to get in and transactions occur in South African Rand or Bitcoin.

“The reason why we chose Bitcoin is we needed one universal payment system that enables micro transactions down to a millionth of a U.S. cent,” Cambridge told TechCrunch on a call.

He co-founded the Cape Town-headquartered startup in 2015 to advance renewable energy infrastructure in Africa. “I realized the opportunity for solar was enormous, not just for South Africa, but for the whole of the African continent,” said Cambridge.

“What was required was a new mechanism to get Africa solar powered.”

Sub-Saharan Africa has a population of roughly 1 billion people across a massive landmass and only about half of that population has access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

Recently, Sun Exchange’s main market South Africa — which boasts some of the best infrastructure in the region — has suffered from blackouts and power outages.

Sun Exchange has members in 162 countries who have invested in solar power projects for schools, businesses and organizations throughout South Africa, according to company data.

The $3 million — which closed Sun Exchange’s $4 million Series A — came from the Africa Renewable Power Fund of London’s ARCH Emerging Markets Partners.

With the capital, the startup plans to enter new markets. “We’re going to expand into other Sub-Saharan African countries. We’ve got some clear opportunities on our roadmap,” Cambridge said, referencing Nigeria as one of the markets Sun Exchange has researched.

There are several well-funded solar energy startups operating in Africa’s top economic and tech hubs, such as Kenya and Nigeria. In East Africa, M-Kopa sells solar hardware kits to households on credit, then allows installment payments via mobile phone using M-Pesa mobile money. The venture is backed by $161 million from investors including Steve Case and Richard Branson.

In Nigeria, Rensource shifted from a residential hardware model to building solar-powered micro utilities for large markets and other commercial structures.

Sun Exchange operates as an asset free model and operates differently than companies that install or manufacture solar panels.

“We’re completely supplier agnostic. We are approached by solar installers who operate on the African continent. And then we partner with the best ones,” said Cambridge — who presented the startup’s model at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield in Berlin in 2017.

“We’re the marketplace that connects together the user of the solar panel to the owner of the solar panel to the installer of the solar panel.”

Sun Exchange generates revenues by earning margins on sales of solar panels and fees on purchases and kilowatt hours generated, according to Cambridge.

In addition to expanding in Africa, the startup looks to expand in the medium to long-term to Latin America and Southeast Asia.

“Those are also places that would really benefit from from solar energy, from the speed in which it could be deployed and the environmental improvements that going solar leads to,” said Cambridge.",2020-06-09 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-authority-freezes-cryptocurrency-traders-bank-accounts/,"Chinese Authority Freezes Thousands of Cryptocurrency Traders' Bank Accounts

Several thousands of bank accounts belonging to cryptocurrency traders have reportedly been frozen by Chinese police as a result of an extensive crackdown on illicit activities. Frozen accounts are not necessarily involved in wrongdoing and supposedly can be unfrozen if the authority finds no evidence of illicit activities.

Police Freeze Bank Accounts of Crypto Traders

The police in China’s Guangdong province have been freezing bank accounts of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency buyers and sellers in the country. Chinese publication 8btc reported on Monday that about 4,000 such bank accounts have been frozen since June 4 on the suspicion of being involved in illicit activities, including money laundering.

Chinese police have been ramping up efforts to crack down on telecom fraud, gambling and cryptocurrency scams, which could result in them freezing related bank accounts. Some accounts have been frozen without any trading activities for several months. According to the publication, the authority claims that tether (USDT) is frequently used in illicit activities. The police are even learning about blockchain and on-chain analysis to understand how to trace crypto assets.

However, frozen accounts are not necessarily involved in wrongdoing and supposedly can be unfrozen if the authority finds no evidence of illicit activities. One investor unexpectedly found that his bank account had been frozen after using yuan to buy cryptocurrency on a major crypto exchange a week ago, the news outlet conveyed.

Recently, a major scam allegedly using cryptocurrencies for money laundering was busted. According to local police in Guangzhou, a city in Guangdong province, the scammers created a fake Huobi website to defraud investors and transferred illegally obtained money to an overseas account.

The country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has been increasing efforts to crack down on money laundering. The publication noted that many crypto startups have been investigated by local financial bureaus and police. Since the PBOC closed down crypto exchanges in September 2017, people in China have been using peer-to-peer OTC trading to exchange between cryptocurrencies and yuan.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are legal in China as several Chinese courts have ruled. The Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People’s Court, for example, ruled that bitcoin is an asset protected by law, and the Shenzhen Futian District People’s Court ruled that ethereum is legal property with economic value. In addition, China passed the Civil Code in May which protects cryptocurrency inheritance.

In the book, Mezrich describes the twins’ legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook to claim their rights over the social media giant, which was originally their idea. A court ruling later awarded the brothers a $65 million settlement for their claims.

Bitcoin Billionaires continues the Winklevoss’ journey from winning the lawsuit in June 2011 to investing $11 million in Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 and becoming the world’s first crypto billionaires.

“This is Rocky II meets Wall Street”

Silverman said that the idea for making the film came to him right after he finished reading the book along with his son, who received an early copy from the twins during his internship at Winklevoss Capital:

“Upon finishing it, it was clear to both of us that Cameron and Tyler’s remarkable redemption story, coupled with Ben’s masterful writing, would lend itself to a one of a kind movie.”

“This is Rocky II meets Wall Street in a world filled with unique and mesmerizing characters,” Silverman added.",,https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-crypto-broker-voyagers-stock-has-doubled-this-year-beating-bitcoin,"For investors looking to bet on the coming adoption of digital assets, there might be a stock for that: Shares of the cryptocurrency retail broker Voyager Digital are outperforming this year, with triple the year-to-date returns of bitcoin.

Crypto markets, just 11 years old, are evolving fast, with more than 5,500 digital-tokens now in existence, many of them trotted out by entrepreneurs with scant revenue to speak of, few proven use cases and minimal supervision from government regulators.

So there’s something to be said for those crypto firms that embrace the scrutiny that comes with being a public company – from investors and regulators alike.

Voyager Digital is one such company, a New York-based broker that aims to help individual investors buy and trade cryptocurrencies. Shares in the company, which went public in February 2019 through a reverse merger, are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and traded in over-the-counter markets.

On Monday, its stock price tumbled 18% to 47 cents, the biggest drop in nearly three months, after Voyager announced it had raised $2.2 million through a dilutive sale of new equity via a private placement led by investors including Susquehanna, Streamlined Ventures and the CNBC personalities Jon and Pete Najarian.

The money will be used partly to fund an expansion of the company’s business beyond its core U.S. market into Canada and eventually Europe, CEO Steve Ehrlich told First Mover in a phone interview.

Voyager is a penny stock, so volatility is a part of the bargain. And indeed, the shares had shot up last week, so even after Monday’s sell-off, they’re still double where they started out 2020.

That compares with a 35% year-to-date return for bitcoin.

Crypto stocks straddle cutting-edge digital-asset technology and traditional Wall Street markets. Benefits for public companies include easier capital raising and potentially free publicity with every headline that crosses. Trade-offs include stricter reporting requirements and the need to stomach wide swings in the ever-visible share price.

It’s a very different model from many of the crypto industry’s largest companies, mostly private concerns like the exchanges Binance and Coinbase and the mining computer maker Bitmain Technologies. Disclosures on the companies’ underlying financial health are harder to find, if available at all.

“Everything we do is scrutinized by auditors, and every decision we make as a board and as a company, we know is something that is potentially disclosable,” Ehrlich said. “A private company has a lot more wiggle room and can do things that never get shared.”

Here’s how glaring that disclosure can be: Last month, Voyager reported an operating loss of $1.78 million during the three months ended March 31, narrower than the $2.8 million deficit during the same period a year earlier.

And its cash dwindled to $1.7 million from $3.1 million in June 2019, even after private-placement capital increases totaling more than $3 million.

Another disclosure that might raise eyebrows: According to a May 20 regulatory filing, Voyager in recent months got two loans totaling more than $1 million from a U.S. government coronavirus-related relief fund, the Paycheck Protection Program.

Many private companies doubtless took the money without the need for immediate disclosure; some $511 billion of the loans were approved as of last week. But for public companies, accepting the financing meant also embracing the risk of any stigma or scrutiny that might come with the revelation.

“We felt comfortable upon conversations with counsel that taking the money was a fair step for us,” Ehrlich said. The financing is helping to pay for three or four new hires, he said.

It goes without saying Voyager is still an early startup company, focused on longer-term trends in the crypto industry. There’s been a lot of talk recently about big hedge funds and money managers nosing into the cryptocurrency market, and Ehrlich says he believes that serving retail investors will become a major growth market in its own right.

Ehrlich is a former executive of the online stock broker E*Trade, which helped to shake up the brokerage industry in the 2000s with its electronic trading tools and expensive Super Bowl commercials. So he’s comfortable with the idea that losses in the single-digit millions of dollars might someday turn to profits in the billions.

Many companies tread that road to profitability in private before going public with an initial public offering. Companies have raised more than $23 billion in IPOs this year on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, including Warner Music Group, which raised more than $1.9 billion.

It puts Voyager’s $29.8 million market capitalization into context. Not exactly a unicorn.

But at least the valuation is public and based on the collective judgment of markets. Ehrlich says that in some ways it’s easier for the company to raise new money – such as in Monday’s private placement – because he can offer new investors the chance to get in at a valuation predicated on a market-determined share price.

“I always have questions when I see valuations on private companies,” Ehrlich said. Meanwhile, “I have a currency that is quite attractive for people in looking to do not just organic growth but for mergers and acquisitions.”

Ehrlich said that, based on internal projections, his company has enough cash on hand to make it through 2021, when, also according to projections, the firm will turn cash-flow positive.

In the meantime, he says, some of the company’s customers now jump on its periodic business-update conference calls and webcasts. It might be their way of assuring themselves that their cryptocurrencies are safe with Voyager.

There’s no assurance, of course, that Voyager will eventually grow out of its penny-stock status – or that its stock price will continue to outperform bitcoin.

But at least investors and customers will know what the company is up to, and how it’s doing.

BTC: Price: $9,714 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,870| 24-Hr Low: $9,610

Trend: Bitcoin’s struggle for clear directional bias continues with prices trapped in the trading range of $9,350–$9,900 for the seventh straight day.

Technical indicators like a golden crossover on the daily chart, a long-term bull cross on the three-day chart, and the positive reading on the weekly MACD histogram suggest the path of least resistance is to the higher side. A slide in the number of coins held on exchanges is also painting a bullish picture, as investors choose to hold.

As such, one may expect the ongoing consolidation to pave the way for stronger gains. However, the technical indicators mentioned above are based on historical data and tend to lag prices.

Additionally, the upward trend from the March low of $3,867 looks to have run out of steam. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to keep gains above $10,000 over the last four weeks and recently dived out of an ascending channel drawn from the March 13 and April 21 lows and the March 20 and May 7 highs.

Meanwhile, the Chaikin money flow indicator, which takes into account both prices and volumes, is printing negative values on the weekly chart. That indicates selling pressure is stronger than the buying pressure right now.

As a result, a pullback to $9,000 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose the higher low of $8,630 created on May 25. On the higher side, the high of $10,500 reached in February is the level to beat for the bulls.",2020-06-09 12:00:43+00:00,https://www.theburnin.com/technology/5-most-important-cryptocurrencies-2020/,"Cryptocurrencies are still coming into their own, and that means they’re evolving on a near-constant basis. Many people around the world have gradually come to understand just what cryptocurrency is, and how it might be useful. But even as this has happened, we’ve seen new cryptocurrencies emerge, and we’ve seen existing ones gain influence. Because of all this, it can be helpful now and then to look at the crypto market as a whole, and get a feel for what the most valuable and influential assets are.

Outside of pure value or market cap, there’s no exact way to measure these digital commodities against one another. As far as we’re concerned though, these are the five most important cryptos in 2020.

Bitcoin

It all still starts with bitcoin. The original cryptocurrency remains the most valuable, as well as the one most investors focus their energy on. While bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset, its potential for spikes in value (such as the surge we saw last summer) make it a very tempting opportunity for many who trade in cryptocurrency. Investments aside, bitcoin also remains one of the most useful options for those who actually want to spend cryptocurrency. It’s accepted at a growing number of stores around the world, and it can also be used to load debit cards that can be used just about anywhere (with the bitcoin converted to cash at the point of sale).

Ethereum

Despite being worth substantially less than bitcoin, Ethereum is frequently mentioned right alongside the market leader. It is in some respects the primary challenger to bitcoin’s status as the leader of cryptos — at least where long-term potential is concerned. What sets Ethereum apart is that it was designed as a platform that could be adapted to a variety of purposes. Basically, people can build “smart contracts” into the Ethereum platform. These are automatically enforced agreements that can facilitate the transfer of assets, information, and so on. The actual cryptocurrency on this network is known as ether, and some believe that as Ethereum applications grow and expand, ether (which is used to conduct transactions on Ethereum’s network) will ultimately gain significant value.

Ripple XRP

One of the trendier cryptocurrencies for the last year or so, Ripple XRP has become a popular item among investors. In fact, an up-to-date look at this asset states that Ripple is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies in the market, alongside bitcoin. There are two main differences between the two, however. One is that currently, Ripple XRP is dramatically less valuable. The other is that Ripple XRP doesn’t use a traditional blockchain the way bitcoin does. Instead, it uses a similar distributed consensus ledger, which actually makes for quicker transactions — one of the factors people prefer about Ripple.

Litecoin

Litecoin is often framed as “bitcoin junior,” and there’s something to that characterization. It was one of the first imitators of the leading cryptocurrency, and it functions very similarly, but at much lower value. There are two reasons litecoin continues to be one of the most significant crypto options, however. One is that like Ripple XRP, it facilitates faster transactions, which can put some traders at ease. The other is that litecoin is hot on bitcoin’s heels as an actual, useful currency, in that it’s accepted by many if not most of the same merchants that accept bitcoin. Some actually find that litecoin’s lower values make it more convenient to use as money as well.

Libra

Finally, there’s Libra — a cryptocurrency (or perhaps stablecoin, more accurately) that doesn’t actually exist yet. As you may have heard, this is an effort by social media giant Facebook to establish its own crypto option. Libra has faced some speed bumps since it was announced in 2019, but it’s still attracting new investors, and could still be released this year. We don’t know exactly what it will look like, but with significant backing, meaningful partnerships, and the Facebook attachment, it’s going to shake up the crypto market when it launches. Even that potential alone makes it one of the most important cryptos to watch in 2020.

Coca-Cola Amatil, the Asia-Pacific bottling giant, has partnered with digital assets platform Centrapay to integrate bitcoin as a payment option from its vending machines across Australia and New Zealand.

This means over 2,000 smart vending machines now accept cryptocurrency.

The machines running the bitcoin transactions are owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, a regional bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products. While the Atlanta-based soft drink producer is a major shareholder in the distributor, the two are separate companies.

Transactions are conducted via New Zealand-based Centrapay and Sylo Smart Wallet, which currently has about 250,000 users. Newcomers can download the Sylo app on their smartphones, add bitcoin to their wallets and scan a QR code to purchase Amatil products.

Sylo co-founder and business manager Dorian Johannink said the digital wallet can typically store, send and receive cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ERC20-compatible tokens like its own SYLO listed on Hong Kong exchange KuCoin.

“But for the Coke scenario, it’s just supported for bitcoin initially for the trial run, but we may extend the functionality,” Johannink said.

Buying a Coke with bitcoin sounds catchy, but the cryptocurrency has notoriously limited scalability, processing an average of 1 megabyte worth of transactions every 10 minutes, after which bitcoin miners prioritize transactions with higher fees.

But Sylo’s main focus is not on bitcoin as a payment form, but on the vision of connecting crypto to the real world and using the architecture of this trial to roll out digital assets as payment tools more broadly. Centrapay announced the partnership on Twitter Monday, echoing Sylo in claiming it was the “first step toward mainstream digital transactions.” The future, as Sylo envisions it, will allow customers to purchase a digital asset in the real world, perhaps a Coke token, and use it to purchase products.

Sylo has moved quickly in the last few months, going from adding bitcoin to its wallet back in March and listing its token on KuCoin, to a real-world trial run in crypto transactions. According to Centrapay CEO Jerome Faury, the initiative has already demonstrated it can work in Australia and New Zealand, and will be “targeting the U.S. market next with some world-first innovations.”

Johannink said Faury has already established connections in the United States and there are plans to move things quickly, but the regional partnership is still in its nascent stages.

Sylo is determined.",2020-06-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-bitcoin-train-inches-toward-10k-wild-predictions-trillion-dollar-crypto-economy/,"Market Update: Bitcoin Train Inches Toward $10K, Wild Predictions, Trillion Dollar Crypto Economy

On Wednesday, the market valuation of all 5,000+ cryptocurrencies is worth around $277 billion after a few coins gathered decent gains during the morning trading sessions. Today, bitcoin is trading for over $9,783 per unit and many traders believe the asset will surpass $10K once again. However, there is a significant amount of resistance at the psychological $10K zone and it’s going to take a strong bull charge to break it.

Crypto Market Cap Holds Above $275 Billion

Crypto asset prices are seeing some gains today, as most of the top ten coins are up between 0.5% to 2% on Wednesday afternoon. At the time of publication, bitcoin (BTC) is swapping for $9,783 per BTC and the market is up 0.68% today. BTC has a market capitalization of around $180 billion and there’s $4.6 billion in global BTC trades today.

Ethereum (ETH) markets are up a hair and each ether is trading for $244 per coin. The market valuation of ETH markets is around $27.2 billion on Wednesday and there’s $1.32 billion in trades.

The third-largest market cap belongs to XRP and each unit is trading for $0.20. With an $8.7 billion market cap and $191 million in XRP trades, XRP is down 0.47% this afternoon.

Tether (USDT) is the fourth largest market cap and the stablecoin’s market is valued at $5.75 billion this week. USDT captures a touch less than two-thirds of the global crypto swaps against a myriad of different crypto assets.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

While BTC and other coins have been rising in value, bitcoin cash (BCH) has been growing in value as well. A single BCH is worth $253.96 per unit and there’s around $300 million in global trades. The top trading pair with BCH today is USDT and tether represents 62% of all bitcoin cash trades. Other pairs include BTC (16.7%), KRW (2.13%), USD (3.33%), ETH (2.16%), GBP (1.08%), USDC (0.70%), and PAX (0.56%). The overall market valuation of BCH is around $4.68 billion on Wednesday.

Blocktown Capital Managing Partner: ‘Crypto Economy Could Reach $10 Trillion’

On Wednesday, Blocktown Capital managing partner Joseph Todero said that the capitalization of the entire crypto-economy could reach $10 trillion when retail investors join. ”When retail money really starts flowing back into crypto I wouldn’t be surprised to see a $10 trillion+ market top,” Todero tweeted. However, not everyone believed Todero, as one person replied: “’When?’ Heard this for what three years now? Retail isn’t coming back whilst the market is this cruel.” Todero did respond to the critic and said: “Cycles take time.”

Blockstream’s Adam Back Claims Bitcoin Could Reach $300K Without Institutional Adoption

The CEO of Blockstream, Adam Back thinks that BTC will surpass it’s all-time high. Back was recently accused by the Youtube channel, Barely Social, as possibly being Satoshi Nakamoto. Although Back has denied the accusation and the Barely Social host explained that he or anyone could leverage “plausible deniability.”

Just recently speaking with the financial news outlet, Bloomberg, Back explained that he thinks BTC could touch $300K.”[Bitcoin] might not require additional institutional adoption [to reach $300,000] because the current environment is causing more individuals to think about hedging [and] retaining value when there’s a lot of money printing in the world,” Back told Bloomberg.

Number of Bitcoin Addresses With More Than a Hundred Are On the Rise

This week data from the crypto aggregator, Santiment, shows that bitcoin addresses with 100 coins or more are growing. “After declining to start the month, the number of addresses holding more than 100 bitcoin has been on the rise over the past five days, with 43 new addresses joining the 100+ BTC club,” Santiment tweeted.

“Over the past few months, the growing number of large BTC holders has coincided with short-term price rallies for the top coin, and vice versa: short-term whale drop-offs typically signaled an incoming price correction as well,” the researchers added.

A survey conducted by Fidelity Digital Assets found that nearly 80% of institutional investors see something appealing about the asset class, the company revealed during a conference call on Tuesday. The percentage of investors who allocated to digital assets increased from 22% in 2019 to 27% in 2020, an indication that an incoming tide of adoption continues, according to Fidelity Digital Assets' director of research Ria Bhutoria.

Indeed, investors have become more comfortable with digital assets on several fronts, with the number of respondents concerned about the asset's price volatility, market manipulation, and lack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value decreasing in 2020 compared to 2019.

Bhutoria said investors have been drawn into the market by ""hard money"" theses and unconventional monetary policy by central banks aiming to stimulate the economy.

The manner in which investors gain exposure to the market varies, with some purchasing crypto directly and others buying derivatives products like futures, according to the survey. This should come as no surprise, given how difficult it is for certain funds to custody bitcoin and other digital assets. And in some cases, they lack the legal mandate to do so.

As such, the number of investors allocated to digital assets via futures saw significant growth from 2019 to 2020, increasing by 13 percentage points.

Fidelity's report did not break down which futures products investors are buying. Still, it's a safe bet to say CME Group's bitcoin futures product would have been the dominant product among US-based firms.

CME Group's bitcoin futures product is perhaps the easiest way for a large investment firm or fund to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin, as my colleague Ryan Todd has noted. For traditional funds — which already trade different futures across assets — CME offers a regulated and liquid venue with which they are already familiar.

The size of CME's bitcoin futures market appears to have grown as institutional investors have sought out indirect exposure to digital assets, as shown by data from Skew. Since the beginning of May, open interest in CME's bitcoin futures product has stood above $400 million.

That's a fourfold increase compared to the end of 2019.

The size of CME Group's bitcoin options market has also seen some growth, picking up significant market share relative to market leader Deribit.

On Tuesday, CME Group's options contract — which launched at the beginning of 2020 — comprised of 23% of aggregated open interest in crypto options. That growth comes in spite of higher capital requirements to trade compared to Deribit.

In terms of volumes, CME's market represents one-third of the total crypto options market. That's a noticeable increase even when compared to a few weeks ago when The Block's Larry Cermak identified Deribit as the clear leader in crypto options.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-10/novogratz-s-galaxy-bakkt-start-white-glove-bitcoin-service,"Why did this happen?

The company crowdfunds commercial and industrial solar projects, claiming to sell the project by the solar cell while “closing the C&I funding gap.”

Here are the steps involved in the Sun Exchange finance model, according to the startup’s website.

Projects undergoing economic and social evaluation are listed as “coming soon” on its solar projects Once a solar project is accepted, a crowd sale of the PV “cells” powers the project in a buy-to-lease solar marketplace. “Once all cells sell out,” the construction partner “installs the solar cells and the rest of the solar equipment.” The lease starts when the project goes live. The business pays to consume the electricity produced by the solar panels. The cell owners receive this as lease rental payments minus insurance and servicing fees on a monthly basis, paid in local currency or bitcoin.

CEO Abraham Cambridge can be found on video saying that the Sun Exchange marketplace is “an entirely new economic paradigm — silicon-based clean energy systems with positive feedback loops to create economies of abundance.” He adds that the company “streams monetized sunshine around the world …. in bitcoin.”

The CEO notes in a video that the company is “converting photons to electrons to crypto in a constant stream” that is “spread around the world from African sunshine.”",2020-06-10 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-releases-bitcoin-based-id-tool-as-covid-19-passports-draw-criticism,"Microsoft’s Bitcoin-based decentralized identity tool, ION, went live with a beta version on mainnet Wednesday as one of many efforts by members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), some of which may fast-track tools anyone can use for COVID-19 crisis response programs.

Microsoft and ConsenSys’s uPort project are both leading DIF members. Separately, Microsoft is also collaborating with the bitcoin startup Casa to create a user-friendly interface for managing multiple digital identities.

“We’re excited to help ION take full advantage of technology like Bitcoin to vastly improve authentication, security and privacy on the internet,” Casa CEO Nick Neuman said in a press release.

“We are thrilled to have Casa collaborating on ION with us, which showcases the potential of building real-world applications that leverage the strong foundation Bitcoin provides,” Microsoft project lead Daniel Buchner said in a statement.

First announced last year, ION is meant to enable user-controlled logins that suit independent companies or services, rather than having system-providers (like Facebook) owning a user’s login credentials. ION can be used for many use cases that aren’t strictly related to health certificates or contact tracing, though the continued spread of coronavirus has influenced its potential usage.

“Almost every group in the blockchain industry is coming up with use cases,” said ConsenSys employee and DIF leader Rouven Heck, referring to potential partnerships with government agencies.

“There are conversations happening at the moment but it’s not a formal agreement,” Heck said.

“Everybody wants to move fast and has a high interest in demonstrating this technology can be very powerful.”

The race is on for companies to work with governments on such high-tech emergency ID measures. There are generally two approaches, contact tracing and digitized medical records, while some Asian governments combine them. For example, dozens of blockchain startups joined forces to start creating an “immunity passport” approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credentials standard.

However, some people see both approaches as controversial, even dangerous.

In May, attorney Elizabeth Renieris resigned from her advisory role at the ID2020 consortium for decentralized ID (DID) creators, including Microsoft, saying she “cannot be part of an organization overly influenced by commercial interests that only pays lip service to human rights.”

Microsoft would not make executives available for an interview, though the company did provide a statement.

“Microsoft is continuing to work on the ION project, which has always included considerations on functionality for a wide range of use cases,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CoinDesk. “While there could be relevant software solutions inspired by new needs and current market demands, Microsoft believes in empowering people and protecting privacy and is committed to growing the open source community and industry standards.”

Layered privacy

Microsoft’s open source ION project uses the Bitcoin blockchain for something comparable to a coat-check ticket.

Rather than include all the data about the coat (or person), which would be hard to scale, it offers a Bitcoin-ledger reference number to the data’s chronology. The heavy data is actually stored between ION nodes using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Whoever is anchoring the data pays a small fee to bitcoin miners to record the reference number.

“The focus is to make things highly interoperable,” Heck said, referring broadly to the urgent work being done on solutions across the space.

Part of the reason why organizations involved with DIF are working to make their technologies compatible across use cases and systems is interoperability might, at the very least, make it easier to build privacy features that apply across the spectrum.

“Uport at ConsenSys are also working on projects,” Heck said. “Microsoft’s ION stack or Uport’s stack should be compatible.”

Even so, some privacy advocates say the project’s safeguards are lacking.

Former W3C employee Harry Halpin, now CEO of the privacy-tech startup Nym, said some of these efforts are simply repackaging previous work.

“ID2020 is just the latest attempt to violate people’s privacy using feel-good rhetoric. It’s also part of a larger business plan. Microsoft and IBM’s entire bottom line is to build identity systems,” Halpin said. “Governments need to establish identities of who owns these keys, so they say, ‘OK, we’ll have an open standard, call it decentralized, and make it mandatory.’”

In the face of such harsh criticism, blockchain advocates are working to identify and minimize the ethical risks of the tools they continue to build.

According to W3C member and nonprofit Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen, it’s not clear the contact tracing like Google and Apple are offering will work unless the vast majority of all Americans use them. Since it’s hard to get enough people on board for contact tracing to work, he worries the most salient result may simply be accelerated data collection.

“Probably the most dangerous type of information, out of all types of personal information, is location data,” Allen said, explaining contact tracing would require privacy tech at multiple layers, from the app level on the phone to the internet infrastructure someone uses.

“It’s incredibly hard to protect,” he said.

In reference to an open source emergency app in Israel, which does have privacy measures yet was operated in cooperation with various government entities, Allen said it’s clear “this data is already out there being collected and [location data] correlation is happening.”

Government partners

Zcash Foundation researcher Henry de Valence agreed such systems are not the best use case for distributed ledger technology, or really any software.

“I don’t think people should build those systems and I don’t think they would be effective at preventing the spread of disease,” he said, adding he does not see so-called immunity passports as any better. “There’s no cryptographically strong way to prove immunity one way or another.”

Some countries, like Honduras, have already implemented some type of blockchain solution for certificates that give people a type of ticket for medical services or free movement outdoors.

However, in these cases, the government generally came up with a policy and found a startup to create the relevant tooling, rather than tech startups coming to policymakers with prospective offerings. One exception, which isn’t widely adopted so far and didn’t use blockchain technology, was NSO Group pitching surveillance technology to American police. Despite the societal risks, crypto companies are taking NSO Group’s proactive approach.

Blockchain certificates

Allen is slightly more optimistic about decentralized identity tools for self-sovereign medical records.

“This architecture is ripe for solving this particular problem,” Allen said, warning this is only in reference to the digital certificate itself. (Whether the medical tests actually prove immunity is a different matter entirely.)

As someone who collaborates with both immunity passport teams and companies involved with the DIF, he said they are taking disparate approaches based on their own evaluations of the tradeoffs. He’s not sure which will be better and hopes the market will decide.

Gold is a popular asset among orthodox investors while the new generation is seeing the value in Bitcoin, and BTSE is becoming the first exchange to directly connecting the two with a derivatives contract.

This will enable the derivatives traders to speculate on the performance of Bitcoin versus gold and predict the future development of the in-demand assets.

Commenting on the new offering, Jonathan Leong, CEO of BTSE, said: “Bitcoin is evolving into a matured store of value. The performance of gold versus Bitcoin fascinates both institutions and retail users, so we are excited to help traders directly trade and speculate on the performance of both assets in comparison with each other by launching a gold index that is priced in BTC.”

The rising demand for alternative assets

The announcement detailed that the exchange’s gold index price is derived from Tether Gold (XAU₮).

Tether Gold was launched last January as the stablecoin issuer saw a growing demand for the alternative asset. Each token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of gold and has been issued on both Etheruem and Tron blockchain.

The futures will be listed alongside other futures contracts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero, alongside major perpetual contracts as well.

According to the exchange, the traders can not only speculate on the market with the gold futures, but also can hedge against inflation.

“The debate of whether gold or Bitcoin is a more reliable store of value is heating up as more institutional investors, central banks, and high net-worth individuals recognize the potential to maximize profits on Bitcoin’s anti-inflationary design,” BTSE noted.

Other than the crypto trading products, BTSE is also expanding its business into other areas and launched a crypto-fiat debit card earlier this year.",2020-06-10 15:01:37+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/russias-economy-ministry-calls-for-controllable-market-rather-than-crypto-ban,"The Russian economy ministry is pushing back against the nation’s planned ban on cryptocurrency.

In a letter to the country’s parliament, the nation’s Ministry of Economic Development criticized a package of draft bills recently introduced by lawmakers. If passed, Russia would at last have its first regulatory regime for crypto and digital assets – but would also effectively ban any businesses facilitating crypto transactions.

According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, which obtained the letter, the ministry points out that people will still be able to buy crypto assets elsewhere, but the current version of the bills would not allow the government to protect their rights. Crypto-oriented businesses would also be driven outside of the country, harming the economy.

Instead, the new rules should take a different approach and work on creating a “controllable cryptocurrency market” in Russia, the ministry argues, according to the report.

The more conciliatory stance on cryptocurrency from a government ministry, however, might be a sign Russia could yet tone down its hostile approach, which recently led to a loud outcry from the local crypto industry.

'Marijuana treatment'

The draft legislation, introduced in late May as a supplement to the previous bill on digital assets, deems illegal any activities facilitating the issuance of, and operations with, virtual currencies and if Russian servers or websites registered by Russian providers are used.

This includes purchasing crypto for fiat currency and accepting it as a payment. However, owning crypto is legal if it’s inherited, transferred as a result of bankruptcy proceedings or seized as a result of a court decision. Also included is the potential to issue digital securities, but that must be done under the full control of the central bank.

“The Bank of Russia does not understand how to control crypto. Rule number one: if you can’t control something, ban it,” a source in the cryptocurrency mining industry, who participated in the working group drafting the bill and asked not to be named, told CoinDesk.

For many crypto businesses, the bills would not actually change much, the source added, as even now, exchanges and over-the-counter services with Russian origins prefer to register in other jurisdictions. And large amounts of cryptocurrency in the country are often purchased for cash.

Sarkis Darbinyan, an IT-focused attorney at Moscow-based law firm the Digital Rights Center, believes that if the law is passed inits current form, cryptocurrency in Russia is going to go from the grey zone “into the darkness of the digital underground.”

“In fact, bitcoin gets the same status as marijuana. You can use it in a limited fashion under the close eye of the state, but can’t talk or write about it,” Darbinyan said.

Under the draft law, he continued, crypto owners would have to report their holdings for tax purposes, and that information would be readily available for the country’s law enforcement agencies. “In the Russian reality, only a crazy person would choose to keep the police posted about the state of their crypto accounts,” Darbinyan said.

Threat to miners

The proposed regulation looks problematic for Russia’s crypto miners, too. While mining is not explicitly mentioned in the draft, the draft bills’ ban on the digital asset “issuance” is likely to cover the sector.

“This draft has been in the works for three years. We suggested some options to legalize crypto mining back in 2019 that was a lot of work, but it all got thrown out the window,” the industry source said,. The mining industry in Russia is yet not big enough to have strong lobbyists to help push their case, they added.

Compounding matters, miners can’t be as nimble as over-the-counter brokers in shifting to other jurisdictions because relocating a building full of mining machines is a much greater logistical problem than moving an office.

However, bigger mining entities in Russia, which tend to keep their businesses secret, might have a quick and easy fix for their pending legal troubles. “You register a company abroad, say, in Hong Kong. This company puts the miners in a data center in Russia, and the Russia-registered company is not issuing crypto,” the source said.",2020-06-10 15:00:26+00:00,,,

TORONTO (Reuters) - Last year’s collapse of Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform Quadriga CX was due to a Ponzi scheme operated by founder Gerald Cotten, who died suddenly in December 2018, the country’s biggest securities regulator said on Thursday.

Cotten died at age 30 from complications of Crohn’s disease while volunteering at an orphanage in India, according to the Facebook page of Quadriga CX, which announced his death in January 2019.

“What happened at Quadriga was an old-fashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology,” staff at the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) wrote in a report.

“While public release of an investigative report is rare, we believe the tens of thousands of Ontarians who entrusted Quadriga with their money and crypto assets deserve to know what happened.”

Facing losses when the price of crypto assets changed, Cotten covered the ensuing shortfall with other clients’ deposits, according to the report.

Richard Niedermayer, lawyer for Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some 76,000 investors from Canada and around the world collectively lost at least C$169 million ($124.2 million)

from the collapse of Quadriga in 2019, the statement added.

About C$115 million of that was due to Cotten’s fraudulent trading, the regulator said.

When Cotten died, the platform owed approximately C$215 million to clients, according to the OSC. Cotten also siphoned off assets for personal use, transferring about C$24 million to himself and Robertson between May 2016 and January 2018, the report said.

About C$34 million was recovered by the bankruptcy trustee and paid to clients, it said. The trustee also recovered assets from Robertson expected to be worth about C$12 million, and Cotten returned about C$10 million to Quadriga in the months before his death, it said.",2020-06-11 21:14:03+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/osc-quadriga-gerald-cotten-1.5607990,"The Quadriga cryptocurrency exchange that saw millions of dollars disappear just as its founder died was a ""fraud"" and Ponzi scheme, according to the Ontario Securities Commission.

The regulator said Thursday that Vancouver-based Quadriga's late founder Gerald Cotten committed fraud by opening accounts under aliases and crediting himself with fictitious currency and crypto asset balances, which he traded with unsuspecting clients.

Cotten, the OSC said in a new report, ran into a shortfall in assets available to satisfy client withdrawals when the price of the crypto assets changed. He started running a Ponzi scheme that covered the shortfall with other clients' deposits, the agency determined.

""What happened at Quadriga was an old-fashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology,"" the OSC said.

""Quadriga did not consider its business to involve securities trading and it did not register with any securities regulator. This lack of registration facilitated Cotten's ability to commit a large-scale fraud without detection. So did the absence of internal oversight over Cotten.""

The OSC spent 10 months analyzing trading and blockchain data, interviewing key witnesses, collaborating with overseas regulatory bodies and using third-party and bank information to reconstruct what was going on at Quadriga in the months leading up to 30-year-old Cotten's death.

Cotten died due to complications of Crohn's disease during his December 2018 honeymoon in India, where he was also opening an orphanage.

Around the same time, Quadriga users reported roughly $190 million in missing cryptocurrency.

Cotten's widow tried to locate passwords for Quadriga accounts, but Jennifer Robertson said she couldn't find any her husband had written down. The laptop he used was also encrypted, she testified, when Quadriga sought creditor protection last year.

On Thursday, the OSC attributed about $115 million of the $169 million clients lost to Cotten's ""fraudulent"" trading.

Another $28 million was lost when Cotten used client assets on three external crypto asset trading platforms without authorization or disclosure.

The OSC said he also misappropriated millions in client assets to fund his ""lavish"" lifestyle and because he was in sole control of the company ever since 2016, he ""ran the business as he saw fit, with no proper system of internal oversight or controls or proper books and records.""

""Quadriga clients could not have known what Cotten was doing,"" said the OSC.

Those clients entrusted their money and crypto assets to Quadriga, which provided ""no meaningful insight"" into how those assets were being stored, moved and spent and instead gave false assurances about asset storage.

By the time the OSC started investigating, over 76,000 clients — about 40 per cent of them Ontarians — were owed a combined $215 million.

Ernst & Young, Quadriga's bankruptcy trustee, was only able to recover $46 million in assets to pay out to clients.

""OSC Staff would likely have pursued an enforcement action against Cotten and Quadriga,"" the agency wrote in its report.

""However, this is not practical given that Cotten is deceased and Quadriga is bankrupt, with its assets subject to a court-supervised distribution process.""

Jeff Kehoe, the director of the agency's enforcement branch, said in a statement that it was unusual, but necessary for the OSC to release the investigative report.

""While public release of an investigative report is rare, we believe the tens of thousands of Ontarians who entrusted Quadriga with their money and crypto assets deserve to know what happened,"" he said.

""Our aim in making this information public is also to prevent this type of situation from recurring.""",,https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/business/local-business/osc-quadriga-founder-gerald-cotten-carried-out-cryptocurrency-fraud-by-himself-461043/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook,"A A

Following the death of the founder of Canadian digital currency platform QuadrigaCx, investigators at Canada’s biggest securities regulator dug into the mysterious case that had stranded more than $180 million of investor funds.

What they found was an old-fashioned fraud wrapped in a new technology, according to a 33-page report made public Thursday.

The Ontario Securities Commission, which investigated alongside an RCMP probe, concluded that Gerald Cotten, who died during a trip to India in 2018, carried out the fraud by himself.

“Staff determined that Quadriga collapsed due to a fraud committed by Cotten,” the OSC said, adding that he had opened accounts under aliases and credited himself with fictitious currency and crypto-asset balances, which he then traded with unsuspecting Quadriga clients.

When he died, the 30-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency platform - from Fall River, Nova Scotia - was also the only one with access to the keys, or passwords, to the digital wallets of more than 100,000 investors. Those wallets were supposed to hold their crypto assets, and the investors have been pressing since Cotten’s death to find a way to access their investments.

But what the OSC revealed Thursday is that their money was largely gone two years before Cotten died — lost to unsuccessful trades in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ether or taken by Cotten to fund a “lavish” lifestyle.

By 2016, Quadriga had morphed into what was more or less a Ponzi scheme, the regulator says, with new investor funds being used to pay out old investors who made withdrawal requests.

“Cotten sustained real losses when the price of crypto assets changed, thereby creating a shortfall in assets available to satisfy client withdrawals,” the OSC explained, adding that he “covered this shortfall with other clients’ deposits – in effect, operating a Ponzi scheme.”

Most client losses fraud-related

The OSC calculated that the bulk of the $169 million in client losses – approximately $115 million – arose from Cotten’s fraudulent trading.

An additional $28 million was lost to trading on other platforms.

“Staff also determined that Cotten misappropriated millions in client assets to fund his lavish lifestyle,” the regulator said Thursday.

Following Cotten’s death, the Quadriga case grew sordid, with investors questioning whether he was really dead and seeking last year to have his body exhumed.

His widow, Jennifer Robinson, said in legal filings that she had received threats.

Quadriga filed for protection from creditors in February of 2019, and entered bankruptcy proceedings a couple of months later. Ernst & Young is the trustee in bankruptcy.

The OSC report said Quadriga was “already in crisis before Cotten’s death, and most likely would have collapsed even if Cotten had lived.”

When he died in December of 2018, the crypto platform owed about $215 million to clients but had almost no assets to cover these liabilities.

“By November 2016, Cotten had injected so many fake assets into the platform that its eventual insolvency was all but assured,” the regulator concluded.

Ernst & Young, the bankruptcy trustee, was able to recover $46 million in assets to pay out to clients, according to the report.

With Cotten dead and the company in bankruptcy, the OSC determined it was not “in the public interest” to bring an enforcement action in the case. But the regulator still wanted to tell investors and the public what happened.

“In this case, our mandate is best fulfilled by sharing enforcement staff’s findings publicly,” the regulator said.

“While public release of a report of this nature is rarely done, we believe that making this review of the facts widely available may help prevent this type of situation from recurring.”

RELATED:",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-stuck-stocks-fed-reality-check,"Bitcoin remains stuck below $10,000 amid jitters in traditional markets over the pace of economic recovery.

As of 11:45 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at around $9,780, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

While bitcoin’s price is down 1% on the day, the major equity market indices in Europe are reporting a drop of over 2% drop. The futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Wall Street’s equity index, are down over 600 points and reporting a 1.8% decline on the day. Asian equities also suffered losses early Wednesday, according to data source Investing.

The Federal Reserve’s dour economic outlook seems to have spooked investors, forcing them to shun risk and take shelter in traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, which has hit a one-month high against the dollar.

The Fed, which held interest rates near zero on Wednesday, said borrowing costs would remain low until 2022. “We are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can for as long as it takes,” Powell said, adding that the job market may not recover for years.

Powell’s comments have damped hopes of a V-shaped economic recovery, with U.S stocks sliding 0.5% soon after. They had been given a boost last Friday by a surprisingly positive nonfarm payrolls report, which showed the economy added over 2 million jobs in May.

Bitcoin is widely perceived as a hedge against the Fed’s inflation-boosting policies, such as near-zero interest rates and massive asset purchases. As such, one may expect it to climb high on the Fed’s commitment to hold rates at record lows for a prolonged period.

However, the bullish move may remain elusive in the short run if the stock market sell-off gathers pace. “While the correlation between bitcoin and equities has been slowly drifting apart in recent weeks, a switch to ‘risk-off’ in global markets could lead to further downside pressure for major cryptocurrencies,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Indeed, the cryptocurrency followed the equity markets in March and April, plummetting from $10,000 to $3,867, as global equities cratered on fears of a coronavirus-induced recession, and investors scrambled to accumulate cash, primarily U.S. dollars.

Now with the halving done, a correlation between bitcoin and stocks may begin to strengthen. Especially as increased mainstream participation from institutions and macro traders appears to make the cryptocurrency, somewhat ironically, more sensitive to global factors.

“The 2020 recession officially marks the beginning of bitcoin as a macro asset class. For retail investors and institutional investors, crypto isn’t the only asset class in their portfolio. Therefore, it’s crucial to look at crypto from a portfolio allocation perspective,” Messari analysts noted in their newsletter last month.",2020-06-11 11:58:49+00:00,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-ira-launches-an-all-new-crypto-savings-program-called-saver-ira-for-retirement-investors-301074426.html,"Saver IRA enables clients to invest in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets for their retirement accounts with recurring contributions.

",,https://in.mashable.com/tech/14682/someone-paid-26-million-in-fees-to-move-134-worth-of-crypto-and-oops,"There are typos, and then there are typos.

Someone appears to have made a mistake this morning when transferring the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), the younger sibling to bitcoin, from one digital wallet to another. After all, when moving around $134 dollars worth of digital currency, it hardly seems like anyone would intentionally pay a $2.6 million fee — and yet that's exactly what happened.

That's right. Someone paid 10,668.73185 ETH, worth approximately $2.6 million at the time, to move 0.55 ETH from one wallet to another. The transaction, in all its painful glory, is visible on Etherscan — a tool for viewing and searching ETH transactions.

While the internet loves a good conspiracy, and many on Twitter are speculating that this is evidence of some elaborate form of money laundering, a much simpler explanation is likely: a mistake.

Ethereum users can dictate the terms of their transactions, setting both the amount of ETH they want to send and the amount of fees they are willing to pay. The higher the fee, the thinking goes, the more likely their transaction will be included on the next block — i.e. it will go through more quickly. It's possible, therefore, that someone attempted to send $2.6 million worth of ETH with $134 in fees and simply reversed the two fields.

Someone missed a decimal point in their gas price. Oops. — Kate Baucherel (@KateBaucherel) June 10, 2020

Which, yeah. Oops.

Of course, we are talking about cryptocurrency, so some kind of convoluted scam is always a possibility. However, this wouldn't be the first time that an unusually large fee has been paid on an otherwise small transaction. In February of 2019, someone accidentally paid 2,100 ETH in fees to move .1 ETH.

Coindesk reported at the time that the South Korean blockchain firm behind the error admitted to the mistake, contacted the mining pool that had benefitted, and worked out a deal where the firm got half of the accidentally sent ETH returned. Notably, that partial happy ending 100 percent relied on the goodwill of the mining pool, as ETH transactions are non-reversible by design.

Is that what happened this time around? It's impossible to know for sure with the information that's publicly available at the moment, but either way, the next time you fat-finger a text message or make an embarrassing typo just keep in mind that it could be worse. Like, $2.6 million worse.",2020-06-11 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/in-a-world-about-to-go-cashless-digital-currency-presents-some-obstacles-amid-coronavirus,"It’s become a near-daily occurrence: Practically every morning, Americans awake to find the next batch of luminaries — everyone from scientists to civic leaders — asking the world to consider the “new normal” in the age of COVID-19. Whether it’s regular mask wearing, the re-imagining of office spaces, or the permanence of telecommuting, it seems some of society’s basic tenets will be turned on their heads in the not-too-distant future.

That, too, will almost certainly lead to more widespread adoption of digital payments as an alternative to cash.

Cash hasn’t been king for some time. While an overwhelming majority of Americans still believe cash should be accepted, their habits say they’re not too attached to their paper money. In fact, according to the Federal Reserve, cash is used in just 26 percent of all transactions, and 49 percent of those are under $10.

Now, in the midst of a global pandemic brought on by the spread of COVID-19, the gravitational pull toward digital transactions has been amplified. Customers are happily leveraging their debit and credit cards, as well as mobile payment vehicles like Venmo and PayPal, to avoid handling communal money. It’s the same environment that has shot virtual currencies like bitcoin back to the forefront of the public consciousness.

After its explosive jump in December 2017 to trading at nearly $20,000 per coin, bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride with more valleys than peaks. But the pandemic could change that for not only bitcoin, but all cryptocurrencies, as both banks and regulators could flock to crypto as a useful way to steady an uneven economy, propping it up once again as the must-have asset in everyone’s portfolio.

Even as it regains steam, though, the nature of cryptocurrency still remains largely niche, and it could severely complicate tax matters for investors who simply can’t keep track of the comings and goings.

Take, for example, the IRS’s own thoughts on the subject. In October 2019, the IRS released additional guidance that spoke to the technological side of cryptocurrency. In it, the IRS addressed some major points of contention, specifically the difference between hard forks and soft forks.

If an investor has existing virtual currency, and the distributed ledger of the cryptocurrency is changed, that’s a hard fork. An example of this is when bitcoin, in an effort to facilitate faster, cheaper transactions, forked to “Bitcoin Cash” in August 2017. According to the IRS, if a hard fork does not result in new units of cryptocurrency, the transaction is not taxable. If it does, it is taxable.

Meanwhile, soft forks — when investors are given new units of crypto in the same currency — are not taxable at all because taxpayers are in the same position as they were before. Sound confusing? Don’t worry, it is.

What’s more, if the dates don’t quite line up for you, you’re not alone. The guidance came more than two years after the first bitcoin fork, leaving investors and practitioners to completely fly blind. Not only are we asking for advisors to take on a heavy lift in understanding some relatively new and very nuanced terminology, the difference between the two could have major tax consequences.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency market offers other products (futures, retirement accounts invested in crypto assets, and interest paid on crypto deposits). Currently, the IRS offers no guidance on those. As virtual currency becomes more popular, practitioners will struggle with the tax treatment of these items, and again, struggle to make recommendations to their clients that will ensure their compliance.

So, as the world envisions itself free of physical cash and rushes to pump money into digital tokens, these complex issues will trickle down to more unsuspecting practitioners and investors. And with the ramifications of a misstep being potentially huge, it will be of the utmost importance to demystify the jargon and to get timelier guidance to help keep an audit at bay.",2020-06-11 15:47:00.832000,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/06/16224241/bitcoins-10-000-psychological-level-retail-investors-vs-whales-and-professional-traders,"The following is a contributed article from a content partner of Benzinga

The general trading direction of bitcoin has been mixed through 2020. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap started the year in a rally from a December low of a little under $6,900 and, by February, it had crested the $10,000 level. Then the pandemic set in and sent prices throughout the investment world into a frenzy, pushing the price of bitcoin to a 200-day low.

Nevertheless, bitcoin rebounded and now sits with about 36.16% in gains year-to-date, hovering at that same 10,000 its seen several times now in the past 12 months. Those who trade bitcoin have no doubt observed that the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain its value past psychological resistance at the $10,000 price point. Over the last four weeks, bitcoin has been finding support around $8,600 but has failed to break out convincingly above the resistance at $10,000.

The bitcoin halving event that happened last month was a big deal, and in the weeks leading up to the halving, there were many predictions about how the halving will send the price of bitcoin to the moon. However, the halving has happened, and bitcoin is still finding it hard to build the momentum for a post-halving rally.

This piece explores why bitcoin seems to be stuck in a range and how a breakout above $10,000 might be the lynchpin to the explosion of a post-halving boom.

The $10,000 Level: Breakout Or Breakdown?

On Monday, June 2, bitcoin recorded a sudden surge that pushed its price above $10,000 – a move that emboldened the bulls while simultaneously squeezing short-sellers.

However, the rally peaked around $10,428 and the trading price slumped by 8% in less than 5 minutes to return bitcoin back to the $9,500 range. It appears that one of the reasons bitcoin can’t seem to make up its mind for a post-halving rally is the effect of the price action in the fight for market dominance between retail traders of bitcoin and those with the capital to make bigger wagers on the cryptocurrency: whales and professional traders.

The chart above superimposes the support and resistance range on the trading price of bitcoin over the past 30 days. From the chart, bitcoin currently has solid support around $9400, the support at $9,200 is thin, and $9000 is not off the table. There’s significant resistance at $10,200, but a breakout above $10,400 could leave the bears in the dust.

One the one hand, the bitcoin whales and professional traders seem to be shorting into $10,000, and on the other hand, retail investors seem to be under-allocating funds above $10,000. The counterbalancing effect of the market dynamics of buy- and sell-sides of $10,000 appear to be the main reason bitcoin is stuck in a range.

The short-term fate of bitcoin seems to be dependent on which of the two camps is able to exert the strongest market-making pressure that will force the other side to give up. If the sell-side pressure continues to rise, FUD might kick in and the price of bitcoin might retest previous lows.

A Surge In Retail Interest In Bitcoin

It is still somewhat hard to draw correlations between bitcoin and other traditional assets because the crypto market is still largely speculative. Nonetheless, large traditional indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index have historically shown a significant impact on the price of bitcoin.

The chart below shows how bitcoin has fared relative to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index, which tracks the value of the USD relative to a basket of four other currencies. Year-to-date, bitcoin has rebounded from the lows it set in March to chalk up a 36.16% gain in 2020. Meanwhile, the USD gave up some of the strength it received during the depths of the pandemic for a YTD gain just 0.28% and the S&P 500 has been able to rebound close to retaking positive territory at -0.89% in losses on the year.

The uncertainties that remain surrounding the global equity markets, like the fact that people are staying at home amidst the COVID-19 lockdown and growing civil unrest across the globe could suggest that retail investment in bitcoin will continue to increase as more investors explore alternative safety investments, even in the historically volatile cryptocurrency market.

If enough retail investors pile into bitcoin and they manage to push the price above $10,400, it could spell doom for whales and professional traders who have margin exposure; thereby, forcing them to start covering their trades. The move could in turn trigger a short-squeeze for cryptocurrencies and turn the expectations of a post-halving rally into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

What Crypto Analysts Think

The June edition of Bloomberg Crypto Outlook suggests that bitcoin will find support at $10,000 and that there’s a decent chance that it will retest the 2017 highs of $19,000 or even extend the rally up to $28,000.

The analysts further note that technical indicators point to a consolidating bitcoin bull setup as it continues to gain upward companionship with gold. They expressed that the “unprecedented year of central-bank easing is accelerating the maturation of the first-born crypto toward a digital version of gold while accentuating oversupply constraints in most of the market.”

Also, the COVID-19 pandemic as well as socio-economic unrest around the world could be hastening the maturity of bitcoin has an asset with an inverse relationship to equities and fiat currencies. Irrespective of what traditional economists think, COVID-19 has uncovered new dimensions in risk analysis that takes into account the possibility of unforeseen global turmoil as a result of mounting environmental, social and civil challenges that already characterize the 21st century juts 20 years in. The fact that a virus could cripple the global economy in modern times was something unthinkable until it happened. That alone is causing people to rethink the concept of money and the real degree of control governments have over those finances.

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has completed its investigation of what happened to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Quadrigacx which owes over 76,000 clients a combined $215 million in assets. Supposedly deceased, its founder Gerald Cotten was found to have committed a series of fraud, the regulator details.

Quadrigacx Fraud: Exchange Owes 76,000+ Clients $215 Million

The Ontario Securities Commission has spent 10 months investigating what happened to the Quadrigacx cryptocurrency exchange. The regulator published a 33-page report of its findings on Thursday. The Canadian crypto exchange announced on Jan. 14, 2019, that CEO Gerald Cotten had died while on honeymoon in India with his wife, Jennifer Robertson.

Noting that “Over 76,000 clients were owed a combined $215 million in assets … Ernst & Young, the bankruptcy trustee, was able to recover or identify just $46 million in assets to pay out to clients,” the OSC staff detailed:

The downfall of crypto asset trading platform Quadrigacx (Quadriga) resulted from a fraud committed by Quadriga’s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cotten.

The OSC staff found that Cotten “spent, traded and used” at will the assets clients deposited with Quadrigacx. “Cotten was able to misuse client assets for years, unchecked and undetected, ultimately bringing down the entire platform,” the staff’s report details.

The Quadriga exchange was cofounded by Cotten and Michael Patryn in 2013; it was incorporated in British Columbia with Cotten as the sole director. Patryn was convicted in the U.S. in a money-laundering case in 2015 under his prior name, Omar Dhanani. He left Quadrigacx in 2016, leaving Cotten with complete control of the platform.

Quadrigacx Is a Ponzi Scheme

The OSC staff found most of the $169 million asset shortfall — approximately $115 million — “resulted from Cotten’s fraudulent conduct, which took several forms.” Cotten “opened Quadriga accounts under aliases and credited himself with fictitious currency and crypto asset balances which he traded with unsuspecting Quadriga clients,” the OSC staff described. “He sustained real losses when the price of crypto assets changed, thereby creating a shortfall in assets to satisfy client withdrawals. Cotten covered this shortfall with other clients’ deposits.” The staff continued, “In effect, this meant that Quadriga operated like a Ponzi scheme.”

Cotten also lost an additional $28 million while trading client assets on three external cryptocurrency trading platforms “without authorization from, or disclosure to, clients,” the OSC staff further added, elaborating:

He also misappropriated millions in client assets to fund his lifestyle. In its final months, Quadriga had almost no assets left and was operating like a revolving door — new client deposits were immediately re-routed to fund other clients’ withdrawals.

However, many believe that Cotten is still alive and faked his death as an exit scam. Some have called for an exhumation and autopsy of his body. The platform ceased operations by Feb. 5 and filed for creditor protection. The complete OSC report on Quadrigacx can be found here.

The Indian government is reportedly reconsidering a plan to ban cryptocurrency and the finance ministry has initiated related inter-ministerial consultations. The move is supposedly spurred by the supreme court quashing the banking ban imposed by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

India’s Plan to Ban Crypto Reportedly Rekindled

The plan to ban cryptocurrency in India is reportedly back on the table. The Economic Times (ET) reported on Friday that “India is looking to introduce a law to ban cryptocurrencies, as the government sees a legal framework as being more effective than a circular from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in this regard.”

The publication detailed that “A note has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultation,” citing a senior government official. The draft cabinet note was spurred from the Indian supreme court’s ruling on March 4 which quashed the RBI’s circular issued in April 2018 that banned financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses, including exchanges, the news outlet described, adding:

The note will be sent to the cabinet after consultations and, subsequently, to parliament.

This note may resemble the bill to ban cryptocurrencies proposed by the interministerial committee (IMC) headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.

The document entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” was submitted to the finance ministry in February last year and published in July. It proposes jail sentences for violators. The bill was supposed to be introduced in parliament in the winter session last year but it was not. The Indian crypto industry had hoped that with the supreme court ruling, the government would reevaluate the proposal to ban cryptocurrency.

What the Indian Government Will Do

The Indian cryptocurrency community is divided on the merit of this news. Nischal Shetty, CEO of local cryptocurrency exchange Wazirx who is behind the #Indiawantscrypto social media campaign, quickly tweeted in response to the report. He pointed out that the note referenced by ET and the IMC report submitted by the Garg committee are two different things, adding:

I’m confident our PM will not stop a booming sector.

Shetty noted some important points to be considered. Firstly, the plan cited by ET is in fact “just a note,” he said. Secondly, a committee will need to be formed to proceed and a draft bill would be needed, he continued, noting that there would be industry consultations before it can move onto parliamentary approval. “Innovative technology will always be seen negatively by those who do not understand it … How would anyone think/talk of banning a technology that cannot technically be banned?”

Policy 4.0 CEO Tanvi Ratna explained: “The consultative process is a long one. If there is agreement to push this, a parliamentary process will begin. This was the expected course after the Feb 2019 report was issued, but it was stalled due to the supreme court case and other priorities.” She opined: “the [supreme court] verdict left every ground open for a legislative ban to cryptocurrencies. If the bill does pass parliament then the verdict would not hold. It’s now time for the industry to fully understand the process and engage constructively.”

According to a report posted June 11 by Steven McClurg and Leah Wald of Exponential Investments, Ether is a “risk-on asset” and not a reliable investment as many in the crypto community believe.

The crypto fund managers liken ETH to “digital tungsten” rather than the digital gold which Bitcoin (BTC) has come to be known as in some circles, in that the token is not stable enough against future purchasing power:

“Ethereum does not have one of the greatest value propositions of Bitcoin: predictable scarcity. Instead, the antithesis is the reality.”

The report states that the monetary policy surrounding Ether issuance is inconsistent, making the supply of the token vulnerable to inflation and unsuitable for a store of value:

“Given Ether’s inability to adequately serve as a store of value, it remains a highly risky speculative instrument. Ether traders look to take profit from its subsequent price changes over a short time-horizon. They chase high returns, coupled with high risk. Visions of digital ingots dance before their eyes. However, these visions are formed without evidence. Like Ether, they are pure speculation.”

Many fund managers still choose Ether

Wald’s and McClurg’s remarks come after a PwC report stated crypto hedge funds’ assets under management doubled in 2019 to $2 billion. 67% of those portfolios included investments in Ether.

Yet the pair conclude “Ether is both a poor store of value and a terrible cryptocurrency to speculate on.”

Grayscale Investments doesn’t seem to agree with this assessment. Cointelegraph reported on June 5 that the firm has purchased $110 million in ETH in 2020. Its Ethereum Trust totaled $290 million as of May 19.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently on a bearish trend, with the price dropping 4% from $245 to $236 within 24 hours.",,https://www.coindesk.com/xapo-suspends-credit-card-crypto-purchases-shifts-operations-gibraltar-bitcoin,"Crypto wallet and bitcoin custodian, Xapo is discontinuing support for credit card payments for digital asset purchases.

“If you make a transfer, the app will detect your country of residence and specify the minimum amount,” the company email said.

The changes come after Xapo announced on May 5 it would be transforming into a digital bank late in 2020. It will also move its operations from California to Gibraltar, which offers a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency firms but sets a high standard for approvals.

Vlad-Călin Nistor and 14 other defendants, including the owner of a car wash, pled guilty for their roles in a transnational and multi-million dollar scheme to defraud U.S. residents.

The guilty pleas were issued at the Eastern District Court of Kentucky, per a Thursday announcement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Four of the guilty pleas were made by Romanian nationals in the past 24 days, with two taking place in the last 24 hours, the announcement stated.

The defendants were involved in a racketeering conspiracy and online auction fraud, defrauding millions of dollars from U.S. residents by selling goods that didn’t actually exist.

The scheme began as early as 2013, according to the statement, when Romanian car wash owner Bodgan-Stefan Popescu coordinated the spread of tools like fake advertisements and account info for IP address anonymizing services to defraud American residents. Popescu also connected these residents with other members of the racketeering scheme, who would impersonate different people over the phone, including eBay customer service representatives and military members trying to sell items before deployment.

Popescu collected Bitcoin through fraudulent means. One of the main ways he did this was by receiving cryptocurrency from co-conspirators through online scams and sending the money to Nistor. Nistor would launder funds generated through CoinFlux, exchange the cryptocurrency for fiat currency and then deposit the funds into bank accounts under the names of employees and family members.

“Through the use of digital currencies and trans-border organizational strategies, this criminal syndicate believed they were beyond the reach of law enforcement,” Assistant Director Michael D’Ambrosio, U.S. Secret Service, Office of Investigations, said in the DOJ statement. “However, as this successful investigation clearly illustrates, with sustained, international cooperation, we can effectively hold cyber criminals accountable for their actions, no matter where they reside.”

Nistor was arrested in December 2018 on an international warrant and was extradited to the U.S. The defendants now await sentencing.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/community-is-puzzled-as-cryptocoms-token-receives-branded-twitter-hashtag,"The Crypto.com Chain token (CRO) is now the second cryptocurrency to receive an emoji hashtag on Twitter. This follows a similar move for Bitcoin (BTC) in February.

Since Thursday, tweeting the “#CRO” hashtag automatically add the Crypto.com logo to it, similar to what happens when tweeting “#Bitcoin” or “#BTC.”

The company launched a promotional giveaway campaign in connection with the event.

Community confusion

Some members of the Twitter community expressed confusion as to why a relatively small project received a dedicated hashtag before others.

However, this appears to be part of a branded hashtag service offered by Twitter to major brands. It comes at a reported price of $1 million, though this is quoted for the traditionally competitive Super Bowl campaigns.

Cointelegraph reached out to the CEO of Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, who did not wish to answer detailed questions on the hashtag. His response was that “we have a team that works relentlessly and creatively to drive engagement on Twitter,” noting that the response to the new hashtag was “beyond our expectations.”

What’s next for crypto hashtags?

Some people called to “crowdfund” multiple hashtags for crypto projects like Ethereum (ETH).

Lolli, a Bitcoin-based cashback provider, responded with a humorous tweet regarding a potential Tron (TRX) hashtag.

Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey is heavily involved with Bitcoin through his company Square, which funds a portion of BTC’s development. He has traditionally ignored all other cryptocurrencies, making it unlikely that another crypto hashtag will be introduced “organically.”

Cointelegraph reached out to Dorsey to learn more about the emoji hashtags, but did not receive a response.",,https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dz35q/cryptocurrency-exchange-wash-trading-coinsquare,"Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare has been artificially inflating how much currency it is trading, according to leaked emails, Slack messages, and other files obtained by Motherboard.

According to the material, Coinsquare was ""wash trading,"" which means it was automatically buying and selling currency between accounts it controlled. The news provides evidence of a practice that is often suspected in the cryptocurrency world but rarely proven, and can draw attention from regulators.

""Turn it back on,"" one seemingly angry March 2019 Slack message from Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond to other employees of the company read, referring to the code that managed internal trades after an employee switched it off, fearing retaliation from regulators.

Coinsquare lets users buy or sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies. With wash trading, it seems like more currency is coming in and out of the company, signifying a healthy exchange which other people may want to use, or perhaps looks more attractive to potential investors. In reality, the exchange is just trading coins with itself.

Several of the leaked documents specifically show Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond pushing for the company to practice wash trading, and employees of the company being uncomfortable with the practice. The documents allege that Coinsquare performed wash trading at least during 2018 and 2019.

""[He] said he didn't approve, but that he did it because Cole asked him to,"" one email between colleagues reads, referring specifically to an employee being told to practice wash trading. ""The decision to continue wash trading was final by Cole,"" the email reads, adding that senior staff asked others to stop using the term ""wash trading"" in email and Slack messages as it could create a problematic paper trail for the company.

""Turn it back on.""

One employee who was able to disable the code decided to do so, seemingly in anticipation of an upcoming visit from regulators, according to the leaked material. In a Slack message, Diamond asked who disabled the code that managed internal trades.

""Me,"" an employee replied. ""Didn't want to test OSC with it,"" they added, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission, essentially the Canadian province's version of the Securities and Exchange Commission which combats insider trading and other financial crimes. The OSC had visited the company just a few days earlier, according to company emails.

""But whoever did that took ZERO steps to ensure that a MASSIVE change to how we are viewed externally would be enormous,"" Diamond replied. ""Turn back on please.""

External parties had already spotted something wrong with Coinsquare months earlier. In August 2018 cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Reddit noticed that much of Coinsquare's trading happened outside of normal trading hours. Others suspected Coinsquare was faking how much the company was really trading.

A section of what a source said was Coinsquare code, obtained by Motherboard, indicates that wash trading occurred while trading Bitcoin and Canadian dollars; Bitcoin and Ethereum; and Bitcoin and Litecoin. The code was designed to buy and sell while wash trading at randomly chosen prices and volumes, according to the file.

Multiple employees were worried about the ramifications of practicing wash trading, according to the emails and messages. A number of workers were ""concerned about the reputational risk this posed to us as professionals,"" one of the emails reads.

Kristen Rose, manager of public affairs at the OSC, declined to say whether the organization is investigating Coinsquare over wash trading.

""As a matter of general policy, we are unable to speculate, confirm or comment on the existence, status or nature of any complaint, review or investigation. This is to protect the integrity of investigations, to ensure the complaint process is not used to affect the market and to promote fairness towards those who are the subject of investigations,"" she wrote in an email.

Many companies have launched a streaming service over the past few years, trying to capitalize on the digital media shift and launching the so-called “streaming wars.”

After Netflix grew from a small DVD-rental company to a household name, every media company from Disney to Apple saw recurring revenues ripe for the taking. Likewise, the audio industry has long-since accepted Spotify’s rise to prominence, as streaming has become the de facto method of consumption for many.

But it was actually the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic that solidified the foothold of digital streaming, with subscription services seeing massive growth over the last year. Although it was expected that many new services would flounder along the way, media subscription services saw wide scale growth and adoption almost across the board.

We’ve taken the video, audio, and news subscription services with 5+ million subscribers to see who came out on top—and who has grown the most quickly—over the past year. Data comes from the FIPP media association as well as individual company reports.

Streaming Service Giants: Netflix and Amazon

The top of the streaming giant pantheon highlights two staples of business: the first-mover advantage and the power of conglomeration.

With 200+ million global subscribers, Netflix has capitalized on its position as the first and primary name in digital video streaming. Though its consumer base in the Americas has begun to plateau, the company’s growth in reach (190+ countries) and content (70+ original movies slated for 2021) has put it more than 50 million subscribers ahead of its closest competition.

The story is the same in the audio market, where Spotify’s 144 million subscriber base is more than double that of Apple Music, the next closest competitor with 68 million subscribers.

Meanwhile, Amazon’s position as the second most popular video streaming service with 150 million subscribers might be surprising. However, Prime Video subscriptions are included with membership to Amazon Prime, which saw massive growth in usage during the pandemic.

Service Type Subscribers (Q4 2020) Netflix Video 203.7M Amazon Prime Video Video 150.0M Spotify Audio 144.0M Tencent Video Video 120.0M iQIYI Video 119.0M Disney+ Video 94.9M Youku Video 90.0M Apple Music Audio 68.0M Amazon Prime Music Audio 55.0M Tencent Music (Group) Audio 51.7M Viu Video 41.4M Alt Balaji Video 40M Hulu Video 38.8M Eros Now Video 36.2M Sirius Xm Audio 34.4M YouTube Premium Video/Audio 30M Disney+ Hotstar Video 18.5M Paramount+ Video 17.9M HBO Max Video 17.2M Starz/StarzPlay/Pantaya Video 13.7M ESPN+ Video 11.5M Apple TV+ Video 10M DAZN Video 8M Deezer Audio 7M Pandora Audio 6.3M New York Times News 6.1M

Another standout is the number of large streaming services based in Asia. China-based Tencent Video (also known as WeTV) and Baidu’s iQIYI streaming services both crossed 100 million paid subscribers, with Alibaba’s Youku not far behind with 90 million.

Disney Leads in Streaming Growth

But perhaps most notable of all is Disney’s rapid ascension to the upper echelons of streaming service giants.

Despite Disney+ launching in late 2019 with a somewhat lackluster content library (only one original series with one episode at launch), it has quickly rocketed both in terms of content and its subscriber base. With almost 95 million subscribers, it has amassed more subscribers in just over one year than Disney expected it could reach by 2024.

Service Type Percentage Growth (2019) Disney+ Video New Apple TV+ Video New Disney+ Hotstar Video 516.7% ESPN+ Video 475.0% Starz/StarzPlay/Pantaya Video 211.4% Paramount+ Video 123.8% HBO Max Video 115.0% Amazon Prime Video Video 100.0% Alt Balaji Video 100.0% YouTube Premium Video/Audio 100.0% DAZN Video 100.0% Eros Now Video 92.6% Amazon Prime Music Audio 71.9% Tencent Music (Group) Audio 66.8% New York Times News 60.5% Spotify Audio 44.0% Hulu Video 38.6% Viu Video 38.0% Netflix Video 34.4% Tencent Video Video 27.7% iQiyi Video 19.0% Sirius Xm Audio 17.4% Apple Music Audio 13.3% Youku Video 9.6% Pandora Audio 1.6% Deezer Audio 0%

The Disney+ wave also spurred growth in partner streaming services like Hotstar and ESPN+, while other services with smaller subscriber bases saw large growth rates thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lingering question is how the landscape will look when the pandemic starts to wind down, and when all the new players are accounted for. NBCUniversal’s Peacock, for example, has reached over 30 million subscribers as of January 2021, but the company hasn’t yet disclosed how many are paid subscribers.

Likewise, competitors are investing in content libraries to try and make up ground on Netflix and Disney. HBO Max is slated to start launching internationally in June 2021, and ViacomCBS rebranded and expanded CBS All Access into Paramount+.

And international growth is vital. Three of the top six video streaming services by subscribers are based in China, while Indian services Hotstar, ALTBalaji, and Eros Now all saw surges in subscriber bases, with more room left to grow.",2020-06-13 15:18:35-07:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackout-cure-needed-btc-price-volatility-challenges-crypto-exchanges,"Nobody can really predict Bitcoin’s (BTC) price volatility. But one thing is becoming painfully predictable when the price of Bitcoin suddenly lurches in one direction or another: One or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges simply goes offline. This leaves users powerless to prevent losses from spiraling, as they are left unable to trade or buy more positions as a hedge.

These outages have happened time and time again. Most recently, as Bitcoin started climbing toward the $10,000 mark, Coinbase went offline. At the time it happened, Cointelegraph reported that this is the fourth time in the last three months that Coinbase has shut down during major moves in the price of BTC. Additionally, Twitter user CryptoWhale pointed out that there have been no fewer than 11 Coinbase outages over the last 12 months, each one coming at a time when Bitcoin’s price had moved more than $500 in value.

The Silicon Valley-based exchange later issued a statement via its blog, clarifying that the June 3 outages were due to an issue with its API, which was seeing five times more traffic than usual. Without directly addressing the issue of the frequency of outages, the blog post stated that Coinbase is “working on reducing the impact of price-related traffic spikes though pre-scaling and caching.” Meanwhile, the exchange saw users withdrawing BTC en masse, following the incident.

A broader problem?

During March’s Black Thursday, BitMEX went offline for 25 minutes, subsequently blaming two separate distributed denial-of-service attacks. However, Twitter users, including the CEO of rival exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and trader lowstrife, called foul play.

BitMEX denied the allegations, but it’s not the first time that the Seychelles-based exchange has been accused of playing dirty. Blogger Hasu aired his suspicions that the company “weaponizes their server problems” back in 2018. This issue is also clearly set out in the form of allegations in the class-action lawsuit currently pending against BitMEX, which states: “BitMEX routinely freezing its servers — which BitMEX blames on technical glitches and limitations — to profit from moments of high volatility.”

A month after Black Thursday, the company saw a drop of 38% in its Bitcoin holdings. It is unclear whether the drop is due to users losing trust in the platform or because of the overall market sentiment, whereby an abnormally high amount of BTC is being withdrawn from exchanges. Meanwhile, BitMEX has struggled to regain the open interest lost in March, implying that it may be losing market share to its smaller rivals, such as Bybit and FTX.

Coinbase and BitMEX are the two platforms that have most often come under fire for downtime in volatile markets. However, data provider Kaiko performed an in-depth analysis of the minute-by-minute trade data for March 12 and 13, covering seven spot and six derivatives exchanges. Five of the spot venues and four of the derivatives platforms were found to have experienced some kind of issue during peak moments of volatility.

Of the spot platforms in question, only Binance and Bitstamp held up, although Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao acknowledged some “glitches on peripheral systems” in a tweet. In derivatives, Binance Futures and Huobi DM managed to ensure uninterrupted trading.

A problem unique to crypto?

Contrary to the crypto sphere, there are no regular instances of the traditional stock markets going down during peak trading hours. Of course, the stock markets don’t see the same volatility as cryptocurrencies, but they do handle trading volumes that are far greater than any crypto exchange. The biggest cryptocurrency exchanges have enough experience of Bitcoin’s volatility to be able to anticipate certain kinds of peaks.

Arguably, some big exchanges also have money to invest in building infrastructure that can handle the kind of volume spikes. Coinbase has raised over half a billion dollars over its lifetime. It could be argued that BitMEX is a minnow, by comparison, having raised only $25,000 with the last seed round in 2015. However, one analyst estimates that BitMEX is raking in around $700,000 per day in fees from its derivatives trading service, which could come to over $250 million each year. Joel Edgerton, the chief operating officer of bitFlyer USA, believes that the issue is one of industry maturity, telling Cointelegraph:

“Crypto exchanges do not have the deep institutional experience that is in a traditional stock exchange. Traditional exchanges have had over 100 years to build the skills, processes and systems needed to handle the volumes they receive.”

Digging deeper

Different exchanges appear to have different views on what could be an appropriate fix for the downtime problem. Bitfinex has recently issued a press release boasting its own performance in 2020, stating that it’s had no major incidents of downtime so far this year. The exchange points to its “obsessive interest in technical improvement” as being the reason why it has managed to achieve this.

Other exchange leaders seem to agree unanimously that the focus should be on the technology above all else. Edgerton explained that bitFlyer was built in Japan by specialists from Goldman Sachs and undergoes continual rigorous performance testing. On the matter, Catherine Coley, the CEO of Binance.US, pointed out to Cointelegraph that:

“Our infrastructure is built to regularly handle over $10 billion of daily trading activity. We have capacity for much larger volumes before our systems would become stressed.”

Stephen Stonberg, the COO of Bittrex, believes that many exchanges may be underestimating the effort and expertise involved in building an exchange that can withstand high volumes during peak times. He told Cointelegraph: “We can say with certainty that building a rock-stable exchange is harder than it looks.”

Unfounded speculation?

While it seems acceptable enough that the crypto industry simply isn’t developed enough to handle high volatility at peak yet, the debate still rages over whether the industry should implement circuit breakers. Meanwhile, some have accused exchanges of using their downtime as a form of a hidden circuit breaker.

Several platforms that have suffered from outages, including Robinhood and Gemini, don’t offer leveraged trading. Furthermore, both Coinbase and Gemini are regulated in the United States. Therefore, it would be a stretch to assume that the platforms take their services offline deliberately. If anything, spot exchanges risk losing out on the fees from users who would happily dump their holdings at market rates instead of setting a limit order.

Related: Crypto Industry Divided Over Introducing Circuit Breakers on Exchanges

Edgerton cautiously told Cointelegraph that there could be two reasons behind the outages: “In one theory, an exchange has lost focus on the cryptocurrency community and is trying to become a financial conglomerate with a hand in every pot.” He added: “In this case, frequent volatility-caused outages are the result of not taking care of the basics.” But it may also not just be about inadequate systems, as he elaborated on another potential theory:

“Some exchanges are closer to a casino business model than an exchange one. Volatile assets like Bitcoin do not need 100x leverage, especially when marketed to retail customers. Additionally, some of these exchanges may actively avoid regulation or not clarify where their business really exists. In these circumstances, it is reasonable that people would question mysterious outages as a hidden circuit breaker that is putting the company’s interests ahead of their customers.”

Users demand better systems and transparency

This year’s volatility has been extreme, even by Bitcoin’s standards. It’s also worth remembering that there are more traders, exchanges and general interest in cryptocurrencies now than at any point in the past. So, in a way, it’s no surprise that the infrastructure of some exchanges has started to creak and groan under heavier loads.

However, transparency is also critical. In traditional markets, regulation forces transparency. In crypto, only some exchanges have chosen to be regulated in order to operate in particular markets. In the absence of regulation, it’s reasonable to expect a certain degree of transparency from exchange operators, particularly regarding how they handle costly issues such as liquidation during volatility. In a crowded market, traders will vote with their feet, so it’s up to the crypto exchanges to meet transparency demands and system stability.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/162707-new-crypto-ban-proposal-in-india-recommends-over-3-million-fine-and-up-to-10-years-prison-sentence-for-entities-dealing-in-virtual-currencies/,"Indian officials are reportedly considering passing a law that would ban the use of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

As reported by India’s Economic Times, the nation’s government might see a legal framework as being more effective than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) blanket ban on crypto-assets.

A senior Indian government official confirmed:

“A note has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultations.”

This development has come after the country’s Supreme Court struck down the RBI’s ban on offering banking services to firms or individuals dealing in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.

The new note, which recommends banning crypto-asset transactions, will reportedly be sent to the Indian cabinet after consultations and then to the Parliament.

In July 2019, a high-level government panel in India drafted a law that recommended a ban on all forms of private virtual currencies. Violators would have to pay an INR 25 Crore (appr. $3.29 million) fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years.

At the time of the March 2020 ruling, the Supreme Court had said that “while we have recognized… the power of RBI to take a preemptive action, we are testing in this part of the order the proportionality of such measure, for the determination of which RBI needs to show at least some semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated entities. But there is none.”

The ruling effectively lifted RBI’s ban on offering banking services to local entities dealing in crypto-assets.

According to several reports, banks haven’t been cooperating with cryptocurrency firms, as they’ve still made it difficult or refused services to these businesses.

Amit Maheshwari, partner at Indian firm AKM Global, claims that the July 2019 draft recommends making it “illegal to hold, sell, issue, transfer, mine or use cryptocurrencies and, if passed in the current form, would completely decimate the crypto-industry in India.”

The panel was headed by Subhash Garg, and had recommended that the RBI look into launching a virtual currency or central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Nischal Shetty, founder of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, says:

“We’re living in dangerous times where we have lost many lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The global economy has also taken a hit with majority of once-thriving industries in shambles.”

Shetty adds:

“Crypto … has been generating jobs across a variety of functions — legal, compliance, tech, marketing, business development, finance, etc. — in India and abroad. There are top-notch projects that have come out of India. Imagine what we can achieve with positive regulation.”

It’s worth noting that blockchain and crypto have been creating new jobs, globally, with companies like Block.one and BlockFi offering high-profile roles.

However, crypto-related crimes, scams, and hacks have been on the rise in India and other countries such as Estonia, where 500 firms lost their licenses recently after billions of dollars of illicit cash had been allegedly laundered via Danse Bank and the use of virtual currencies.

Moreover, cryptocurrency exchanges encourage speculative trading by listing coins which have very limited or no practical use cases. The sector is now well-known for its controversial initial coin offerings (ICOs) which scammed investors out of billions of dollars during the past few years. Initial exchange offerings (IEOs) haven’t lived up to expectations, either.

Shetty notes that there are around 5 million Indian consumers who are reportedly using cryptocurrencies. He argues that the country should tap into the $250+ billion crypto market, however, most of these initiatives don’t last very long.

For instance, DogeCoin (DOGE), a highly popular cryptocurrency, Bytecoin, Siacoin, ODEM, and Bibox token are just a few projects that have been marked as “dead” by Coin Code Cap, a website that tracks how active the development communities are for digital currency projects.",2020-06-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/estonia-revokes-500-crypto-firms-licenses-after-220-billion-money-laundering-scandal/,"Estonia Revokes 500 Crypto Firms' Licenses After $220 Billion Money Laundering Scandal

Estonia has canceled 500 cryptocurrency firms’ licenses, about 30% of the total, as part of a crackdown on illicit financial flows following a $220 billion money-laundering scandal involving Danske Bank.

Regulators are concerned that bitcoin exchanges and other crypto companies might be liable to using their platforms to facilitate illegal transfers, Bloomberg reported.

Madis Reimand, who heads the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), indicated that the clampdown was a pre-emptive strike aimed at cleaning up the crypto industry. He notes that the idea is not to cripple the sector, but rather tighten regulations to prevent risks associated with money laundering.

To date, the FIU has shut down companies that failed to start operations in the Baltic state within six months of getting a license.

“This is a first step in tidying up the market, allowing us to take care of the most urgent issues by permitting operations only for companies that can be subjected to Estonian supervision and coercive measures,” Reimand said.

The moves come after Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest lender, was accused of facilitating $223 billion of laundered money through a small Estonian branch. Europe’s biggest money-laundering scandal has left egg on the face of Estonian authorities, forcing them to turn attention to crypto firms, a sector considered high risk.

Until now, Estonia has been a haven for virtual currency companies. The north-eastern European country was among the first on the continent to liberalize crypto in 2017, licensing more than 1,400 entities in a space of three years.

But regulators have become stricter, in an effort to curtail international risks related to money laundering. The Estonian parliament recently passed a law that makes it difficult to obtain a crypto license.

According to the new regulations, permits will now be issued after three months at a cost of €3,300 ($3,715). Previously, it took 30 days to obtain the same license for €300. Cryptocurrency outfits registered in Estonia will also need to incorporate in the country or open an Estonian branch of a foreign firm.

Reimand warned that over 50% of the remaining 900 digital asset companies may lose their licenses “as they have no operations in Estonia and their managers are outside the country.”

A Spacex bitcoin scam has frequently appeared on Youtube, claiming to give away BTC. Its promo video features the recent Spacex launch with two NASA astronauts and an interview with Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The scammers claim that anyone sending bitcoin to them will be “airdropped” twice the amount sent.

Spacex Bitcoin Scam: Elon Musk’s BTC Giveaway

A bitcoin scam claiming that Spacex and its CEO, Elon Musk, are giving away bitcoin has been growing more common. Videos advertising that Spacex and Musk are giving away 5,000 BTC have repeatedly appeared on Youtube, featuring Spacex’s May 30 launch in collaboration with NASA and other projects. The historic launch marked the first human space mission from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011.

The Spacex Youtube bitcoin scam video shows a live interview with CEO Elon Musk about the recent Spacex launch. An URL and a bitcoin address are displayed on the video for people to send their coins to participate or learn more about the BTC giveaway.

The URL on the video redirects to a webpage, entitled “Spacex Foundation 5,000 Bitcoin Giveaway Airdrop.” The site states: “At a time of such global crisis, Spacex is here to offer all the help that we can. We understand the financial uncertainty that some people may be facing right now, and have decided to giveaway 5,000 bitcoin, in our best attempts to help out.”

To participate, you need to send any amount of bitcoin between 0.1 BTC and 20 BTC to the bitcoin address provided, which the scammers call the “official contribution address for this event.” The fake Spacex bitcoin website continues, “once we have received your transaction, we will immediately send back (2x) to the address that you sent the bitcoin from.” That means “if you send 5 BTC, you will be airdropped 10 BTC + 25% bonus,” the scammers wrote.

The Spacex bitcoin scam website even has a “terms and conditions” section that reads: “This promotion is available worldwide. Anyone can participate. You can only participate once. If you try to participate more than once, your BTC will be automatically refunded. You can send bitcoin using any wallet or exchange – it does not matter.” Continuing to display red flags, the site further states:

If the transaction does not process properly, please try by sending the same amount to the BTC address again, and it should go through. Your original transaction will be refunded as you can only participate once.

BTC giveaway scams often feature famous people or events that are hot at the time. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on a 5000 BTC giveaway scam leveraging the name of Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya. Besides Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, other well-known people whose names have been used to promote bitcoin scams include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and a number of executives in the crypto space.

Some people claim to have fallen for the scam and have complained to Google Inc., owner of Youtube, but the scam videos keep reappearing on the video-sharing platform. Anyone coming across bitcoin giveaways must take caution as there are many of them. Spacex and CEO Elon Musk do not give away free BTC, but many scammers falsely use their names in an effort to make fake cryptocurrency giveaways appear legitimate.

GlobalData compiled a list of top 10 blockchain influencers after analyzing Twitter conversations from more than 200 experts.

After the analytics firm noted that the most searched trend among influencers was ""bitcoin,"" they commissioned the study.

Most searched trends among companies were: Coinbase, Blockstream, and Microsoft.

The top 10 blockchain influencers were ranked based on GlobalData's assigned scores that measured specific metrics, including follower count and connections network on Twitter.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO at Messari, claimed the top influencer spot on blockchain topics in the first quarter of 2020, according to analytics firm GlobalData.

The firm analyzed its Blockchain Influencer Network Platform, which follows more than 200 experts in the field and their discussions on Twitter.

These influencers were ranked based on GlobalData's assigned scores that measure metrics such as follower count, number of tweets with topical keywords, number of engagements their content receives, and their connections network.

GlobalData found that ""bitcoin"" was the most discussed trend among influencers in the first quarter of the year, ahead of ""cryptocurrency"" and ""fintech.""

The conversations largely grew out of news that India's supreme court lifted a ban on cryptocurrency trading and legalized crypto exchanges in the country.

This drew attention from global companies and investors eyeing the potential of Indian cryptocurrency start-ups, GlobalData said.

Apart from the influencer space, companies were found to be discussing ""coinbase"" the most, followed by ""Blockstream"" and ""Microsoft.""

GlobalData found that conversations on Coinbase emerged from news that the coinbase card is now compatible with Google Play, making it the first company to enable crypto mobile payments.

Especially in the current scenario, where the global health pandemic has caused immense economic distress, digital currency is arguably going to lead the next financial revolution. While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, etc. have proved their importance, it is the right time to explore and invest in the newer ones, which will add real-life value and drive mainstream crypto adoption. In this context, CashTelex is one of the most promising projects in the crypto space.

About CashTelax

CashTelex is a financial platform based on blockchain technology, which offers complete financial independence and enables 100% ownership of one's own funds. The platform comprises a cryptocurrency exchange which is powered by its native token named CTLX. The exchange platform is equipped with several advanced trading tools, and also offers numerous other benefits to traders. Apart from the exchange, CashTelex is connected to several other systems, which form an inclusive financial ecosystem.

Benefits of Investing in CashTelex

Primarily, CashTelex adds real-life value, which is one of the most crucial factors in driving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. CTLX holders will be able to pay for goods and services using this currency on ClashTelex's in-house e-commerce website - just like any other traditional shopping site, these goods will be delivered straight to the user's address. Being able to use crypto to pay for regular usage items contributes to the idea of adopting it as a serious currency, and CTLX serves that purpose seamlessly.

CTLX is directly pegged to physical assets like gold and real estate, unlike many other cryptocurrencies. Hence, it is expected to be much less volatile, and remain stable over a longer duration of time. This relieves users from constantly being concerned about fluctuating prices. On top of that, this enables token holders to store CTLX in their CashTelex accounts and earn regular dividends out of those. Moreover, the exchange also facilitates the buying and selling of these tokens on the same platform.

Story continues

One more benefit of joining the CashTelex community is gaining access to its highly secure and easy-to-use wallet, through which one can make and receive payments at minimum transaction fee. The platform is further developing a feature using which users will be able to buy and sell gold using CTLX.

The new top banking regulator for the Trump administration sees “huge and great promise” in cryptocurrency. Focusing on decentralized networks, bitcoin, and rewriting existing regulations, he shares his views on cryptocurrency and the creation of the digital dollar.

Top US Banking Regulator Is Pro-Crypto

Brian Brooks recently became the new acting Comptroller of the Currency, the top banking regulator for the Trump administration. The 51-year-old has experience in crypto, having previously served as general counsel to bitcoin exchange Coinbase. Discussing his views on cryptocurrency, regulation, and technology, Brooks told Forbes:

There is huge and great promise in blockchain and crypto.

He elaborated: “Blockchain has potential to connect up, in a decentralized network, all kinds of data … It has the ability to create large, friction-free, decentralized networks of people.” Brooks believes that “blockchain is the solution to our problems,” Forbes conveyed. “I’m very bullish on technology … Things like AI, things like blockchain have a better ability to leverage the wisdom of crowds,” he was quoted as saying.

As acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brooks is the administrator of the federal banking system and chief officer of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC supervises nearly 1,200 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks that conduct approximately 70% of all banking business in the U.S. The Comptroller also serves as a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

A lawyer by trade, Brooks joined the OCC in March as chief operating officer, appointed by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. The former banker was previously executive vice president and general counsel at Fannie Mae. He, Mnuchin, and former Comptroller Joseph Otting worked together at Onewest Bank in Pasadena, California, which was heavily criticized for its foreclosure practices in the years after the financial crisis.

New Top Banking Regulator Shares His Views and Policies on Cryptocurrency

Discussing his views on cryptocurrencies, Brooks told the publication that he is “looking for decentralized networks in general — he cited bitcoin, ether and XRP in particular — to solve many of the problems hindering more than one-thousand financial institutions under his purview,” Forbes contributor Cory Johnson detailed.

The new acting comptroller also revealed that he is focusing on rewriting existing regulation on “bank digital activities.” Citing banks’ antiquated money transfer methods, he said that it takes three days to transfer money from the U.S. to Europe on the SWIFT network. Not only is people’s money at risk during that time, but they also incur foreign exchange fees, he noted, adding that these problems can be eliminated using digital assets.

Moreover, Brooks sees a threat in other countries modernizing their payment systems, leaving the U.S. lagging behind. Criticizing the Fed’s version of faster payments, he revealed: “There are certain O.C.C. regulations that require that certain things be transmitted by fax and require banks maintain a fax number. Those were written at a time when faxes were a cool technology. Now they’re mandates.”

Regarding the digital dollar, Brooks is skeptical about the federal government issuing one. He opined:

I’m not in favor of a government-created token … I just don’t think that’s the role of government, quite honestly. But I think that the Fed and the SEC need to be putting up frameworks of what that digital currency needs to be.

Meanwhile, the most crypto-friendly commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to serve another term. Commissioner Hester Peirce, often known in the crypto community as “crypto-mom,” has been nominated for another term as an SEC commissioner. Her existing term expires this month but commissioners may serve up to 18 months beyond the expiration of their terms. Peirce’s nomination needs to be confirmed by the Senate.

A strong advocate of the SEC approving bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), she introduced the “Token Safe Harbor Proposal” in February to “fill the gap between regulation and decentralization,” proposing a grace period of three years for tokens. The commissioner recently said that there is an increasing demand for cryptocurrency, particularly from institutional investors.

Cryptocurrencies became popular because their programmers touted them as anonymous. It has, however, emerged that they are not and that transactions undertaken using altcoins can be traced.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Over time with the increased government scrutiny and unwanted invasion by phishers, users now realize that the cryptocurrency world is not as anonymous as most of them were led to believe.

A tech startup called, CryptoMixer is changing all this and giving back cryptocurrency enthusiasts their security and privacy. The start-up provides a cryptocurrency mixing platform that obscures your cryptocurrency transactions, making it hard for anyone to trace your dealings. CryptoMixer reintroduces anonymity by allowing online shoppers that pay using cryptocurrency through addresses that remain anonymous when the user is completing transactions. The shoppers, as such, cannot be associated with the various addresses they use.

How Does Coin Mixing Work?

Coin mixers work by essentially collecting cryptocurrency from the people using cryptocurrency, mixing it with a giant pile of other cryptocurrencies, and then sending them smaller units of cryptocurrency to an address of their preference, with total the amount that you put in minus 1-3%. The 1-3 % is generally taken as a profit by the coin mixing company. This is how they make money.

A cryptocurrency mixer (also known as a blender) allows you to spend, store and share cryptocurrencies, without your transactional data becoming public. In short, it makes your financial transactions anonymous in the true sense. It is done by mixing your transactional data with a pool of Bitcoin data. This ensures your data is secure, you have control over your privacy, and no data can be traced back to you, as the link between the sender and the receiver is broken.

Crypto Mixer: The crypto mixing solution

CryptoMixer is a unique cryptocurrency mixer/blender that ensures your cryptocurrency becomes untraceable, and no link exists between the stakeholders. They have designed different pools of cryptocurrencies based on their sources, with variable fee percentages. This segmentation and differentiation ensure the clean mixing of the currency. The three pools include Standard Pool, Smart Pool, and Stealth Pool. It uses a 'smart code' to avoid the same currencies from reaching a user on multiple occasions.

Features of Smart Mixer Platform

Zero Post-Transaction Logs - CryptoMixer platform keeps transaction logs for only as long as it needs them. The longest period that these logs can remain is 24 hours, otherwise, the platform keeps them only for as long as is necessary to complete a transaction.

Full Anonymity - The need for complete anonymity is greater in the online space, and it is only second to the information online prowlers seek. Users that mix cryptocurrency on the platform do not even need to input their information. Instead, only the recipient altcoin address is necessary.

Customizable Process - Users can set various parameters as they so choose. You, for instance, can choose the amount of cryptocurrency to mix, the commission to pay for the mixing, and the delay period you prefer.

The importance of privacy and security while transacting online cannot be stressed enough. It probably is the reason why platforms like CryptoMixer are timely. The advantages it offers hold the possibility of making crypto mainstream.

There are 41 active developers working on Libra, meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the world’s largest smart contract platform, has 36 active developers, the data site reveals.

Other active open-source protocols include Near (NEAR), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), CELO, and IOTA – even though it recently experienced serious issues including a million dollar hack.

Filecoin (FIL), a highly-anticipated blockchain project that has been aggressively rolling out updates, is the 7th most active project right now in terms of developer activity.

Insolar (XNS), a Swiss enterprise blockchain development firm that counts Microsoft, Oracle and AT Kearney amongst its business partners and clients, has also consistently been in the top 10 in terms of having the most active development.

As confirmed in a separate report by Outlier Ventures, blockchain interoperability project Cosmos (ATOM) has seen many developers contribute to the ongoing development of its protocol.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) development has remained steady due to the significant amount of support it receives in terms of grants to developers, and also international support from established organizations like the Human Rights Foundation.

Development for stablecoin Dai, Decred (DCR), Stellar (XLM), Algorand (ALGO), Waves, Lisk (LSK), and Cardano (ADA) has remained fairly steady despite the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting economic uncertainty.

Despite being a fairly new player in the competitive DLT space, Libra has managed to attract 176 active authors in the past year – which is a lot more than any other project.

This has all been going on while Facebook had to make significant changes to it development roadmap for Libra, after regulators heavily scrutinized the initiative – citing concerns about the social media giant’s issues related to privacy and many lawmakers being against Big Tech moving into finance.

As reported, Facebook’s Libra may serve as signal that Fintech firms like Visa, Paypal, Booking.com have been eager to explore stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing sectors in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the blockchain space, in general.

Bitcoin's options market suggests Monday's price drop could be short-lived.

However, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to a sell-off in stocks and increased miner hoarding is a sign the market lacks strength.

Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity on Monday alongside losses in the traditional markets.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,080, representing a 2.7% decline on the day. Prices hit a three-week low of $8,910 during the early European trading hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 are down over 2.5% and major Asian and European equity market indices are in the red red, apparently over fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections in China.

The decline in bitcoin prices, however, could be short-lived, options market data suggests.

While bitcoin looks to be tracking equities lower, the top cryptocurrency’s put-call volume ratio has risen to three-month highs. At 1.79, the ratio currently stands at the highest value since the markets crash on March 12, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

The put-call volume ratio is an indicator of relative trading volumes of put options (bearish bets) to call options (bullish bets). To put it another way, trading volume in put options has been significantly higher than that in calls.

“A put-call ratio above 1 is considered to be an indicator of a selloff while a put-call ratio below 1 is an opportunity to buy,” as per Investopedia.

However, when the ratio gets too high (extreme bearishness), the market is considered to be ready for a reversal higher, and when the ratio is too low, the market is considered close to topping out.

Put-call volume ratio

In bitcoin’s case, a reading above 1.7 could be considered too high. In the past, the ratio has breached that level only two times. Further, on both occasions, prices bottomed out on the same day or the following day.

The put-call volume ratio rose to a high of 1.89 on March 12, when the cryptocurrency fell by nearly 40%. On the following day, prices bottomed out at $3,867.

Similarly, the cryptocurrency bottomed out near $6,500 in mid-December with the put-call ratio rising to levels around 2.00.

As such, the latest reading of 1.79 could be considered an advance warning of an impending bear trap – more so, as the put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of open put options relative to open call options, recently hit a 14-month low of 0.40.

Put-call open interest ratio

“The divergence between the put-call volume and the decreasing put-call open interest implies that a lot of the put positions have been closed out on profit-taking,” according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.

Validating Thomas’ argument is the recent decline in the one-month put-call skew from 9.4% to 6.3%. The put-call skew measures the price of puts relative to that of calls. The decline, therefore, represents a recovery in demand for (bullish) call options.

Meanwhile, the three-and six-month skews are also hovering in the negative territory, implying stronger demand for call options expiring in the September and December expiry contracts.

That said, options market positioning is known to change quickly and the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to potential deeper sell-off in the equity markets.

“The key thing to watch over the next few weeks is the Covid related equities sell off. If markets react very negatively towards the increased Covid cases, we may see more panic which could also pull bitcoin lower,” said Thomas.

In addition, bitcoin’s network statistics are painting a bearish picture and the cryptocurrency’s “fair value” looks to be below $7,000, according to Atlantic House fund manager and ByteTree founder Charlie Morris.

Miners, in particular, have accumulated inventory over the past seven days, selling less coins than they generated.

Key Takeaways The stock-to-flow model uses scarcity to predict Bitcoin’s price, assuming that its price will rise with each halving

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he disagrees with the theory

The Bitcoin-stock-to-flow model predicts prices through scarcity, calling $288,000 BTC by 2024. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin calls the theory into question.

Stock-to-Flow Is Unprovable

First popularized by the anonymous crypto analyst PlanB, the stock-to-flow model predicts Bitcoin’s price through scarcity. Usually applied to commodities such as gold and silver, whose diminishing supply determines its price, the stock-to-flow model can be applied to an asset with a limited supply, such as Bitcoin.

The model takes into consideration Bitcoin’s block reward halvings and predicts that its price could reach as high as $288,000 in 2024. While Bitcoin maximalists celebrate this model, the co-founder of Ethereum is not convinced.

Vitalik Buterin called the model “unfalsifiable,” claiming that the very way it was set up made it impossible to disprove. If Bitcoin’s price peaked before the halving, the model proves to be correct as it suggests that the price rose in anticipation of the halving, he explained. This thinking, however, is applied to any other point in Bitcoin’s timeline when its price peaked:

The ""halvings cause BTC price rises"" theory is unfalsifiable: Was the peak before the halving? Then it ""rose in anticipation of the halving""

During? ""Because of the halving""

After? ""Because of…"" The last $20k peak was near the halfway point between the 2016 and 2020 halvings. pic.twitter.com/dhVxhmECQS — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 14, 2020

Later on in the conversation, he affirmed his position, saying he “disagreed” with the model entirely.

Applying Scarcity to Bitcoin is Incorrect, Buterin Says

Some Twitter users noted that the stock-to-flow model itself doesn’t imply that a peak is a direct consequence of the block reward halving, but that each period between two halvings sees different orders of magnitude due to the changes in supply. If a period between two halvings turns out not to follow this pattern, it would make the theory falsifiable.

Ricardo Lopes, a software developer, replied that if prices between two halvings decreased, then that would disprove the model. PlanB, the analyst that popularized the model, chimed into the discussion, saying that halvings did make Bitcoin scarcer and that the model wasn’t so much about the “peaks,” but rather the average price levels the coin sees between halvings.

During the last few months in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak and faltering global economy, many individuals have shown an interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, oftentimes people can find the process a bit daunting because they are not used to using crypto assets and have never experienced the process. The following article is a quick guide on how to get a cryptocurrency address, receive digital assets, and send them as well.

Creating a Bitcoin Cash Wallet and Obtaining a Receiving Address

Amid the crazy economy, a lot of people have noticed a number of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and bitcoin cash (BCH) have done far better performance-wise than a majority of stocks, bonds, and commodity assets worldwide. For instance, the crypto asset bitcoin cash (BCH) dropped to a low of $150 per unit on March 12, 2020, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday.’ The price of bitcoin cash has gained 60.66% since then at today’s BCH price of roughly $241 per BCH. At a price of $9,453 per unit, Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 162% since March 12, when it traded for $3,600 for a brief period that day.

Besides the price rises, many people are beginning to understand the importance of a censorship-resistant and permissionless, electronic peer-to-peer cash. However, many people get frustrated when they try and learn the process of obtaining a crypto address, receiving digital currencies, and sending them to people after learning to store them in a wallet. In this article, you will learn the basics of all three of those tasks by leveraging a noncustodial Bitcoin.com Wallet and some practice.

In order to get a cryptocurrency address, you need a wallet. Basically crypto wallets are software applications that allow you to send, receive, and store digital currencies on a mobile phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. The Bitcoin.com Wallet allows people to use bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin (BTC), and crypto tokens built using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). For today’s testing, we are only focusing on the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash with the ticker symbol BCH. The Bitcoin.com Wallet is noncustodial, which means the company has zero access to the funds and you are 100% in control of the storage. This means when you create a wallet, you need to back it up immediately using the twelve-word mnemonic phrase.

Generating an Alphanumeric Address and Receiving Crypto Assets: QR Code or Copy & Paste

Once you have created a Bitcoin.com Wallet on one of your devices, the process of storing, sending, and receiving is very simple. All you need to do to obtain a bitcoin cash (BCH) address via the Bitcoin.com Wallet is by simply pressing “receive.” You need to choose what wallet you will be receiving to and in this example, it would be bitcoin cash (BCH). After selecting BCH, the wallet will generate an alphanumeric address that allows you to accept BCH to that specific address.

There are two ways to copy the address. One way is giving someone a copy or picture of the QR code, and a person with a QR code reader tied to their bitcoin cash wallet will be able to scan the code. The second way is by copying and pasting the BCH address by copying it to your device’s clipboard and sending it to another person. With this address, any person from anywhere around the world can send you bitcoin cash.

Sending Bitcoin Cash by Scanning a QR Code or Copying an Address to a Device Clipboard and Pasting It Into the Wallet’s Sending Screen

Once someone has sent you some bitcoin cash, you then have the ability to send it all to another address or send it in fractions to various individual addresses. To send someone some BCH, simply launch the Bitcoin.com Wallet and select the “send” button. This will direct you to a screen that allows you two options; either copy and paste the recipient’s wallet address into the address box or you can select “scan QR code.”

After one of those two options has been completed, you need to choose a wallet that holds your unspent bitcoin cash (BCH) and enter the amount you wish to send to the individual. After selecting the number of funds you want to send, simply press the “next” button. There will be a confirmation screen that shows you all the details of your transaction and if you are happy with the details, simply “slide to send” to deliver the transaction. Alternatively, you can also send money from one wallet to another wallet within your device’s application.

Practice Makes Perfect

Obtaining a cryptocurrency address is very easy once you download a wallet, and most wallets follow the same standards when it comes to getting an address and the sending and receiving processes. There are many wallets that allow people to store cryptocurrencies in a noncustodial fashion.

Also if it is a different cryptocurrency, obtaining an address and sending and receiving an address is pretty much the same process. The biggest difference is, each cryptocurrency has an alphanumeric string, but they look different in the beginning of the address. For instance, bitcoin cash (BCH) addresses look different than ethereum (ETH) addresses, but the process of sending and receiving is the same.

After doing these steps a few times, you should easily get the hang of obtaining a crypto address, and using a wallet to send and receive digital currencies. When practicing, try sending small fractions of a cryptocurrency like bitcoin cash (BCH) in order to feel more comfortable with the processes. A great number of crypto assets have a network fee associated with sending a cryptocurrency, and bitcoin cash (BCH) fees are always less than a U.S. penny per transaction.

On the BTC and ETH networks, fees could be higher than you realize, and you may have to adjust a transaction accordingly. Besides fees, doing this step-by-step process regularly with even just a few dollars in bitcoin cash, will turn you into a well-seasoned machine in no time.

In their report published last week and obtained by The Block, strategists at the bank led by Joshua Younger and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said that bitcoin rarely deviated from its intrinsic value or mining cost in the past few months, and outperformed other traditional asset classes, proving its resilience.

There was also little sign of a flight to liquidity within the cryptocurrency market, and the market structure was “more resilient” than forex, equities, treasuries, and gold, according to the strategists.



Bitcoin saw one of the “most severe” drops in liquidity around the peak of the crisis in March, “but that disruption was cured much faster than other asset classes. At this point, Bitcoin market depth is above its 1-year trailing average, while liquidity in more traditional asset classes has yet to recover,” said the strategists.

“That cryptocurrencies largely survived the stresses of March point to longevity as an asset class,” they added, “but price action points to their continued use more as a vehicle for speculation than medium of exchange or store of value.”

The strategists said there is “little evidence” that bitcoin served as a safe haven i.e. “digital gold” during the March market panic. Instead, its value appears to have been “highly” correlated to risky assets like equities.

“Though correlations were modest and mostly mean-reverting around zero for much of the past couple of years, in recent months they have moved sharply higher in some cases (equities) and lower in others (U.S. dollar, gold). [...] That suggests that...cryptocurrencies have traded more in line with risk assets since early March,” said the strategists.

Stablecoins also got a mention in the JPMorgan report. The strategists said stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), emerged largely “unscathed” from the turmoil.“These tokens were relatively well behaved—though daily volatility is much higher than one would want from a truly managed exchange rate, it did not rise appreciably either in March. In that sense, their backing held through the most acute phases of the crisis,” they added.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-trading-and-cryptocurrency-industry,"A growing number of indicators suggest that institutional players are continuing to enter the digital asset markets, which have been dominated to date by high-net-worth individuals and actively trading crypto enthusiasts. Case in point: Crypto markets are seeing all-time highs in futures contracts’ open interest at entities such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Widely known as one of the world’s largest financial derivatives exchanges, the CME enables sophisticated traders to trade in asset classes such as agricultural products, energy, metals and crypto futures and options.

Traders on the CME are generally institutions, not individuals, which is why this open interest in the digital asset market is noteworthy. Institutions that are already onboarded and active on the CME — trading wheat and oil for example — are increasingly moving into crypto futures as an alternative asset class. In fact, derivatives volume increased to an all-time high in May, totaling $602 billion while total spot volumes increased 5% to $1.27 trillion. As a result, derivatives represented 32% of the digital asset market in May, compared with 27% in April, according to CryptoCompare’s most recent Crypto Exchange Review.

Other credible indicators include the latest report from Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of the $7.9 trillion asset manager. The survey found that of the nearly 800 institutional investors surveyed, almost 80% find something appealing about digital assets. Respondents ranked three characteristics of digital assets as almost equally compelling, that they: are uncorrelated to other asset classes (36%), offer an innovative technology play (34%) and offer a high potential upside (33%).

But what’s far more eye-catching is the fact that six out of 10 respondents believe digital assets have a place in their investment portfolio — and this survey was done prior to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. If the survey were taken today, it would be interesting to see where the numbers would fall given widespread discussion that the global crisis could be a tipping point for the mass adoption of digital assets.

For instance, macro investor Paul Tudor Jones recently publicized his investment in Bitcoin (BTC) and credited the pandemic with substantially altering his interest in digital assets. His thesis is that quantitative easing will lead to inflation and he views Bitcoin as one of the best inflation hedges.

Support for crypto assets at this level instills confidence in the asset class a whole. The proof is in the numbers and the numbers reveal that crypto assets are becoming increasingly popular with institutional investors.

Moreover, open interest made a new all-time high on six consecutive days from June 5-10.

Significant growth in CME futures points to rapidly growing interest by institutional investors in trading regulated bitcoin derivatives products. Despite this growth, however, CME Group “has no plans to introduce additional cryptocurrency products,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Thus for now, CME Group’s cryptocurrency products will only involve bitcoin.

CME, which launched its bitcoin options product only at the beginning of 2020, now represents over 20% of the global bitcoin options market measured by open interest, or the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. It’s now the second-largest bitcoin options market in the world behind Panama-based Deribit, according to Skew.

Growth in CME’s bitcoin options market is “a strong signal that regulated institutions are exposing their books to bitcoin,” said Matt Kaye, managing partner at Los Angeles-based Blockhead Capital. “CME has a higher cost of capital and is closed on weekends, so anyone trading there is likely making those sacrifices because they have to.”

Much of CME’s growth appears to have come at the expense of Deribit. Market shares claimed by competing bitcoin derivatives markets LedgerX, Bakkt and OKEx have remained largely unchanged since January.

Indian news site The Economic Times created a stir Friday by suggesting lawmakers in India, where the Supreme Court overturned a punitive banking ban from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) only four months ago, were planning on slapping a new ban on crypto companies.

The article, titled “With a law, India plans lasting ban on crypto,” cited one unnamed “senior government official” who told The Economic Times, “A note [presumably on crypto] has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultations.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The article doesn’t provide any information on what the note could be but says it was spurred on by the Supreme Court ruling, which allowed crypto exchanges to finally access banking services after nearly two years stuck in the wilderness.

The article said the government could lean on a previous government draft law, from July 2019, that proposed all forms of cryptocurrency be banned, with anyone caught holding them facing up a fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.

But is there any substance to this?

Well, the report in question relates to one published by a government panel, chaired by former Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. While the report recognizes blockchain technology is an “important new and innovative technology,” it notes, “with serious concern,” that the use of cryptocurrencies in India is “mushrooming” at an alarming rate.

Highlighting that many crypto assets don’t have any intrinsic value and supporting the RBI ban, the report concludes: “The Committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalising carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India.”

The only exception, they say, would be a digital currency issued by the state itself.

Speaking to CoinDesk, Nischal Shetty, the founder and CEO of WazirX, a local exchange acquired by Binance late last year, said a blanket ban on crypto wasn’t what he was seeing.

“This is all leaked information,” Shetty said. “There is movement for sure, but no one has been able to get clarity on whether it specifically talks about a ban, or whether it talks about just moving forward with regulation. There are a lot of assumptions.”

Based on his own government sources, Shetty said he believes the Finance Ministry is consulting with other government departments to determine what the next regulatory step should be.

“I’ve personally met people in government, right, ministers in Parliament, and what I’ve seen is they’ve been very positive about regulating,” Shetty said. “Some of them have been very vocal that a ban is not the solution because they understand technology … they understand that banning a technology is not a solution.”

The original draft bill from the Garg committee – which has long since been wound up – is still floating in the Finance Ministry and Shetty agrees it could form part of the “default content” when determining how to move forward with crypto regulation.

“Someone from the Finance Ministry has proposed that they should consider looking into cryptocurrencies and figuring out what to do, either to ban it, or to regulate it,” Shetty said, as the lifting of the RBI ban has made this a priority for officials. “[The government] wants to see progress and regulations,” he added.

But, he points out, the idea of reaching out to other departments is in order to take in other viewpoints. Citing Bloomberg Quint’s appraisal of the note, Shetty highlighted: “if in any way, they [the Finance Ministry] get pushback that a ban is not the right way approach, then they would set up another committee, which would explore [crypto] regulation.”

“I see this as a positive step,” he continued, “there is no clarity in India today. It’s a good thing that someone is taking the initiative.”

Shetty’s thoughts have been echoed elsewhere.

A spokesperson for the Bangalore-based exchange CoinSwitch said, “the report has no mention of the particular government body responsible for such actions or contains quotes from reliable sources. As such there is a lack of clarity and until further details reveal we would carefully monitor the situation.”

Similarly, Sumit Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, one of the country’s largest exchanges, told CoinDesk in an email that “reconsidering past bills is likely part of the process of forming clearer regulations around the use of cryptocurrencies within India.”

Gupta noted the lifting of the RBI ban has led to record trading volumes and user adoption, calling recent growth in the sector “unprecedented.”

CoinTelegraph reported earlier this week there has been a flurry of new exchanges launching in India, as well as a wave of outside investment from global players, including OKEx and Binance.

“Given the previous open-mindedness of government officials and regulators in the Supreme Court case, where they were willing to engage with cryptocurrency sector leaders in dialogue about the future of the industry – we are confident that a similarly communicative approach will be taken in making this decision,” Gupta said.

Among some of the existing industry players in India’s crypto scene, a consensus is building around starting more formal dialogues with officials. There’s already an active crypto-related trade body within the Internet and Mobile Association of India, which helped challenge the RBI ban.

Shetty said WazirX was looking at creating a self-regulatory framework.

“We have to show our government on why we are already practicing KYC [know-your-customer verification] and all the standard practices in India as exchanges,” he said. “I think a formal regulatory note from us would be helpful in going in the right direction.”",2020-06-15 08:02:17+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/okex-paxful-fiat-currency-crypto-onramps,"Crypto exchange OKEx is partnering with peer-to-peer marketplace Paxful to enable new fiat on-ramps for its customers.

According to the statement, Paxful would work as a fiat-to-cryptocurrency ramp for OkEx and its services will allow users to buy bitcoin with over 160 different national currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Indian rupee and Thai baht.

“With this partnership, we hope to make crypto more accessible as a real-world payment method,” said Ray Youssef, CEO and co-founder of Paxful, in the statement.

Following reports that Chinese authorities are freezing bank accounts of cryptocurrency traders, five banks have reportedly clarified their policies. They confirmed that accounts with legal crypto transactions will not be frozen. However, some people claim that their accounts have been frozen without involvement in illegal activities.

Crypto Traders’ Bank Accounts Frozen

Chinese police have been freezing the bank accounts and bank cards of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency traders as they crack down on illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported that about 4,000 bank accounts had been frozen in China’s Guangdong province. A few days later, local media reported that the police in Sichuan similarly froze the bank accounts of crypto traders and miners.

A China Times reporter asked five banks regarding their policies in freezing the bank accounts of customers with crypto transactions. China Merchants Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China responded the same way. The news outlet conveyed on Saturday:

As long as the operation is legal, the channel is legal, the virtual currency source is legal, the page supports bank card service, bank card users’ funds will not be intentionally frozen unless it involves illegally related cases, such as money laundering and fraud.

Nonetheless, there are reports of people saying that they are not involved in any illegal activities but their bank accounts have been frozen. A woman told China Times that she used her bank card to purchase cryptocurrency on a large crypto exchange and her account was frozen a week later. “I was a little shocked at the time,” she said, insisting that she “did not participate in any illegal activities.” As she tried to get her account restored, her bank said, “the card was frozen by the police, so wait for the notification.” A bitcoin miner whose bank account was also recently frozen shared his story with the publication, stating: “I have been notified that I can unfreeze with my ID card and related information.”

China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has been increasing its anti-money-laundering efforts. According to local media, Chinese police have cracked down several large-scale money laundering cases involving cryptocurrency. While Chinese regulators closed down local crypto exchanges in September 2017, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain legal in the country, as ruled by several Chinese courts.

Although banks claim that accounts showing legal transactions and operations will not be frozen, industry insiders recommend using a separate account to buy cryptocurrencies. “It is best not to use bank cards with important purposes to purchase cryptocurrencies, such as debit cards linked to mortgage loans [and] wages.”

Analysts say a risk reset in the traditional markets fueled bitcoin’s rise from $8,900 to $9,580 in the last 24 hours. “Bitcoin has regained poise, possibly tracking the recovery in global stock markets,” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital.

Major European equity markets are reporting gains of over 2% at press time, while futures tied to the S&P 500 are up 1.2%, according to Investing.com. The situation was different 24 hours ago when S&P 500 futures were down 2% due to renewed fears over the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Sentiment on Wall Street turned positive during yesterday’s U.S. trading hours after the Federal Reserve announced it would start buying yet more corporate bonds. The S&P 500 ended the day with a 0.83% gain. The risk appetite improved further during Tuesday’s Asian hours after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration is preparing a near $1 trillion infrastructure proposal.

The turnaround in the global equities likely helped bitcoin rise back to $9,600. In the past, the cryptocurrency has closely followed traditional markets during bouts of coronavirus-induced panic.

Most notably, the cryptocurrency crashed from $10,000 to $3,867 in the first half of March, as stock markets cratered at the prospect of a coronavirus-induced recession. In the following five weeks, both stocks and bitcoin witnessed solid recovery rallies.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,550, representing a 1% gain on the day. While the unprecedented stimulus programs are widely expected to bode well for bitcoin in the long run, in the short-run, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to losses in stock markets.

Prices may fall again fall back to $9,000 in the next 24 hours if the stock markets lead the way lower. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to present a dour outlook on the economy during his semi-annual policy report on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Fed said last Wednesday the economy would take years to normalize, dashing hopes for a V-shaped recovery.

From a technical analysis perspective, a clear break above $10,000 is needed to confirm a bullish breakout. The bulls have persistently failed to keep gains above that level over the past three months.

Daily chart

“Bitcoin has been flirting with the $10,000 mark since May but has since been coming back down,” said Vijay Ayyar, Asia head at cryptocurrency exchange Luno. “This is what is typically known as ‘distribution’, where a lot of the gains made in the past few months by large traders are sold into weaker hands.”

The psychological $10,000 barrier, however, may soon be breached as larger investors seem to be accumulating bitcoin.

As of Monday, there were 2,151 addresses with balance more than 1,000 BTC, the highest since mid-March, according to data from Glassnode. The so-called bitcoin “rich list” has increased by nearly 3% over the past two months.

A convincing move above $10,000 would likely yield a stronger rally to resistance lined up at $11,950 (September 2019 high). Meanwhile, on the downside, $8,500 is a key support. “If that level is breached, prices could decline to the levels we saw in the crash in March: $7,700, and then $7,100,” said Ayyar.",2020-06-16 12:19:58+00:00,https://www.internationalinvestment.net/news/4016545/revolut-clients-legal-ownership-cryptocurrencies,"Revolut, the digital or ""challenger"" bank, has announced a modification to its terms to allow customers beneficial ownership of their cryptocurrency portfolios.

The news caused a stir in the country, which saw its latest crypto ban overturned in April

However, Indian crypto companies believe this is highly unlikely and have been introducing various educational efforts to boost adoption

Share this article

A new ban on Bitcoin ownership in India is unlikely, say companies working in the country’s crypto industry. The rumors about a new ban began last week after a news report cited an unnamed government official, who said an anti-crypto proposal was in the works.

Crypto Ban Rumors are “Overblown”

After the Indian Supreme Court overturned a two-year-old ban preventing banks from providing services to companies that deal in cryptocurrencies, the industry began to gear up for an influx of new customers. With over 1.3 billion people, India is believed to be the next driving force for the industry.

However, the burgeoning sector was stirred to the core last week when rumors about another potential ban began circulating online. What started these rumors was a report from the Economic Times. The publication cited an unnamed government official who said that a bill proposed in July 2019 banning the ownership of cryptocurrency would be considered again.

While the sources themselves haven’t been disputed, companies working in the crypto sector believe that these rumors are “overblown” and “highly unlikely” to happen. Nischal Shetty, the founder and CEO of WazirX, said that this was nothing more than rumors and assumptions. Shetty, whose exchange was acquired by Binance last year, said that his own sources within the government were “very positive” about regulation and haven’t mentioned bans.

Disregard Rumors, Work on Adoption

Sumit Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, one of the largest exchanges based out of India, said that reconsidering “old bills” was part of the process of regulating the use and ownership of cryptocurrencies.

Gupta believes that the Indian crypto sector is yet to see its heyday, which is why CoinDCX has launched a new online platform aimed at education called DCX Learn. In a press release shared with Crypto Briefing, the company said that DCX Learn was part of its plan to introduce cryptocurrencies to 50 million people in India. The platform will provide learning material in the form of guides and articles, as well as extensive online courses and interactive lectures.

The newly launched learning platform perfectly illustrates the industry’s ambitious plans to tap into the vast Indian market. DCX Learn is undoubtedly filling a hole in the market. Kashif Raza, the co-founder of CryptoKanoon, said that there was a need for better access to knowledge and toolsets to make the onboarding process safe and productive:

“The launch of DCX Learn comes at a time when India is bullish on crypto—and with more resources and information available to Indian users, we are confident that the industry can achieve long term, sustainable growth.”

The finance ministry, on June 12, has passed a draft cabinet note which seeks to set up a legal framework for banning cryptocurrency in India. According to media reports, the note has been shared with the other ministries for consideration. However, the details of the draft are not available.

The report stated that the government would lean on a previously drafted bill by Garg committee, from July 2019, which proposed all forms of cryptocurrency are banned and anyone caught holding them could face a hefty fine and up to ten years imprisonment.

“It’s not clear whether the finance ministry intends to work upon the old draconian crypto bill or whether they plan to work on bringing a new bill,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO, WazirX.

Shetty, in a blog post, said with over 5 Mn young crypto enthusiasts, India is poised to gain a big share of the $250 Bn crypto market. Further, he said that the government should revisit the entire bill and think in the direction of innovation and encourage a fast-growing industry as it is in India’s best interest.

Calling for a crypto-friendly law, Shetty said that crypto startups have been generating jobs across a variety of functions, including legal, compliance, tech, marketing, business development and finance in India and abroad, amid the pandemic-created economic crisis. Also, he said that some of the top-notch projects have come out of India. “Imagine what we can achieve with positive regulation,” added Shetty.

Also, many crypto exchange founders and startup CEOs told CoinDesk that the rumours of India considering a new ban on crypto may be premature.

Capital One Services, which deals in credit cards and auto loans, says its system uses AI technology for “analyzing [the] credibility of cryptocurrency-related information.”

Humans face barely surmountable obstacles and pressures when they trade crypto, the filing states.

The market runs 24/7 and it requires investors to know the intricacies and nuances of very distinct protocols as well as watch out for events such as airdrops, forks or hacks that come streaming in from multiple sources including Twitter, Medium posts and crypto news sites, the content of which cannot always be readily verified.

“It would be impossible for human traders to track all of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency-related data and respond to that data in real-time,” the patent reads. “Further, it would also be difficult to verify the credibility of the cryptocurrency-related information in real time. In particular, it is difficult to verify the credibility of speculation, rumors, opinions and other information posted on social media and elsewhere.”

Awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last week (patent no. 10,679,229), Capital One’s AI verification system can be split into three crucial components.

First, the system has a specific AI program that looks out for one kind of information such as tweets. After finding a potentially noteworthy event, it feeds it back to a “credibility analysis engine,” which cross-references and determines whether the event is credible based on historical examples and, if so, how the market has responded in previous instances.

It then collects all the information, processes it and uses it to make quick trading decisions.

Capital One said the AI engine could become nuanced and sophisticated at interpreting information. The system might be able to detect fake volumes and evaluate the speed by which news, such as an exchange hack, goes viral across various social media platforms and news sites.

“The machine-learning algorithm,” the patent reads, “can also determine the reach … and how quickly the news spreads out, what investors said and felt … on social media as the news was spreading out, how long it took for the initial fear, if any, to fade out, for the “buy-the-bottom” mood to arise, as well as for the market to bounce back up.”

But Capital One says its patent will need further nuance before it can be launched as a new service (and generally, the filing of a patent does not necessarily indicate intention to launch a product). It’s unclear as it stands whether the system could execute trades autonomously or whether they would have to be okay’d by a human first.

Like the rest of the U.S. banking sector, the broader Capital One group blocked account holders from purchasing crypto using their credit cards in early 2018. The bank has defended its decision, saying it wants to shield clients from the high levels of fraud, loss and inherent volatility in crypto.

This same sentiment is reflected in the patent filing: “As with many nascent markets, many cryptocurrency investors rushed into the market without adequate knowledge and experience in either trading or cryptocurrencies. In fact, many of the cryptocurrency investors were trapped by short-term market movement and lost money quickly.”",2020-06-16 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/if-crypto-is-anything-like-fixed-income-its-going-to-need-a-fatter-textbook,"Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management.

Very few people can claim a full grasp of bitcoin from the jump. Most start as skeptics, then after a few months some become a bit more open-minded (albeit still confused), and then eventually succumb to Plato’s Cave, emerging years later as educated and passionate adopters and evangelists. It is no small feat to grasp the philosophical, economical and psychological nuances of the world’s largest digital asset.

And that’s just bitcoin. What happens when someone dives into the rest of the opaque world of digital asset investing?

The term “cryptocurrency” is a misnomer. While a select few are in fact “currencies,” this broad label is actually not nearly broad enough. “Cryptocurrency” implies a very simple construct where each currency can be traded peer-to-peer on an open protocol as a medium of exchange. But today we have a more complex digital asset ecosystem. The majority of today’s digital assets have unique sets of properties, and thus require different methods of analysis and comprehension. We’ve come a long way from the days when we analyzed every “cryptocurrency” using MV=PQ, a monetarist theory whereby if supply of money increases, economic activity will increase (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity, P is the price of goods and services and Q is the quantity of goods and services).

Today’s digital assets universe is similar to the fixed-income market. Most people understand the basic concept of debt and can explain what a bond is, yet the “Handbook of Fixed Income Securities” written by Frank Fabozzi is over 1,300 pages long! Clearly, there is more to the bond market than just coupon payments and principal repayment. This “fixed-income bible” is required reading for anyone who begins their fixed-income journey.

The book discusses bonds with different maturities, different coupons and different covenants. It discusses different issuer types (government, municipal, investment grade, high-yield, distressed, asset-backed, etc.) and distinguishes between bond features (callable, put-able, convertible, sinkers, bonds with warrants, etc.). It discusses important valuation concepts such as duration and convexity and introduces “bond math” and recovery values. Clearly a “one size fits all” investment framework would not be prudent for such a complex topic.

Over time, as with fixed income, digital asset participants will begin to specialize.

Similarly, the digital assets ecosystem has evolved from the early days of simple homogenous “currencies” to an ecosystem now worthy of its own long explanatory handbook. We can now invest in, and utilize, digital assets issued by faceless entities, decentralized projects, digital asset corporations, traditional non-crypto companies, individuals and soon-to-be governments. The investment vehicles consist of SAFTs, private tokens, public tokens, DAOs, and digital debt and equity instruments. We have tokenized time, predictions, basket tokens and NFTs. Some digital assets are true utility tokens meant for a targeted use case on a specific platform. Others are quasi-equity/quasi-utility tokens with amortizing features, dividends or buyback/burn mechanisms. And, of course, we’ll eventually need a whole chapter dedicated to security tokens, which one day will look more like straightforward financial instruments.

Analyzing value accrual for these digital assets requires blending traditional finance valuation techniques (like a P/E ratio) with token design mechanisms intended to drive active network participation. For example, the growth in the total value locked (TVL) for DeFi tokens (up tenfold to $1 billion in a little over a year) demonstrates that using high staking rewards (inflation) to reduce velocity and float has the potential to create a long bias for holders and increases the costs of borrowing, making it hard to short the token. In addition to inflationary rewards, these early adopters are providing collateral to the staking pool and earning yield based on the transaction fees the platform is generating, which once again, lends itself to traditional cash flow analysis.

We’ve barely scratched the surface, and we’d probably already be on page 100.

There are a myriad of issues holding established investors back from entering the digital assets space, but using a proper narrative and setting more realistic expectations can help investors better understand how to view and analyze this new asset class. Over time, as with fixed-income, digital asset participants will begin to specialize. Investors with certain unique skill sets and investment goals will begin to focus on the subsets of the market that appeals most to them, or best fits their goals.

The digital assets space is new, different and still largely misunderstood. But so are all new asset classes and products when they are introduced. From high-yield bonds to credit default swaps to exchange-traded funds, each new financial product started out slowly before becoming widely understood, investable products.

Europe and the U.S. are filled with them. The rest of the world is an ocean of blankness with a few scattered islands.

Source: Lighting Network Explorer

Africa appears to have eight nodes total. From this map, entrepreneur and IT guru Chimezie Chuta inferred that he is the only person in Nigeria known to be running a Lightning node.

A crucial caveat is that many users might be running nodes without exposing them to the world. But, all told, Lightning activity looks sparse on the planet’s second-largest and second-most populous continent.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Chuta wants to change this. Like many Bitcoiners, he believes running a network node is one of the best ways to become truly financially independent. A Lightning node in particular, while experimental and maybe risky to use, allows Africans to earn a little cash by way of fees for relaying money across the network, he said.

To that end, BlockSpace Technologies Africa Inc., Chuta’s company, has released a kit for a Bitcoin and Lightning node, including all the hardware pieces for assembly, called SpaceBox, in the hopes of expanding the technology’s use across the continent.

“I think this will help many people living in low-income regions of the world to become part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Beyond trading and speculation, Africa seems to have zero representation,” Chuta said.

Many Africans don’t have access to financial services like traditional bank accounts. In 2015, the World Bank estimated that 350 million people living in Sub-Saharan Africa were “unbanked.” In theory, running the pair of nodes could connect Africans to a more modern financial system – and do so in a way that gives them greater visibility and control over their funds than relying on third parties.

Chimezie Chuta

The SpaceBox sells for 210,000 naira, the Nigerian currency, worth roughly $541. The main component of the kit is a tiny hobbyist computer called the Raspberry Pi running the open-source Raspblitz software for Lightning nodes. It also has a solar panel component, since many Africans lack electricity.

“Our goal is to raise an army of full Bitcoin Lightning node operators to dot every nook and cranny of the continent in the next one year,” Chuta said. “We plan to sell and deploy at least 250 of these nodes … in the next six months.”

So far, over the last month the company has received seven orders, one from British Columbia, five from Nigeria, and one from Ghana.

Financial sovereignty

Some readers may feel deja vu. Half a decade ago, Africa was touted as fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. Back then, cheaper remittances were supposedly the killer app.

Compliance costs, along with bitcoin’s scaling challenges, complicated that narrative. While some people, including in Nigeria, indeed use bitcoin for remittances today, it hardly put a dent in Western Union.

Chuta’s pitch is different, emphasizing the autonomy that comes with running a full Bitcoin node, and the income from a Lightning one. It’s a way to earn and safeguard money, not just zap it to someone else.

Operating a Bitcoin full node basically means running the underlying infrastructure for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unlike mining, which requires significant investment in specialized chips, electricity and cooling, anyone can run a node on a laptop with enough space. At least 10,000 people are running nodes today – a conservative estimate since not all nodes show the world they are running.

While there’s no direct financial reward for running a Bitcoin node, it has an advantage over both custodial services (where a third party holds the private keys) and simplified payment verification wallets (which verify only their own transactions). A full node “self-validates” by retrieving every transaction recorded on the blockchain. With this information and the node rules downloaded, users can verify firsthand that transactions follow the network rules.

As the ultimate bullshit detector, it can tell if you’re getting false data.

“Being financially sovereign has become a necessity and Bitcoin offers the primary tool to attain that,” Chuta said.

SpaceBox’s Lightning node component is built on top of the Bitcoin node. Lightning attempts to solve one of Bitcoin’s biggest problems: increasing scalability so more people can use the network at once. If successful, it might become the main method of making everyday payments in the cryptocurrency – and generate revenue for those running nodes.

“Although operating a full Bitcoin Lightning node is more like a hobbyist engagement, some people are already making some money by positioning their nodes as [a] Lightning payment routing channel,” Chuta said.

Solar-powered

There are several options for building Lightning nodes, such as RaspiBlitz, or just purchasing them already put together from vendors like myNode.

Most node makers assume that users will have a stable electric source to plug into, which isn’t a safe assumption in Sub-Saharan Africa where, according to The World Bank, more than one half of the population lacks electricity.

“With regards to infrastructure, Nigeria (and a number of other African countries) have very poor electricity supply so keeping a full node running is very difficult,” Bitcoin Core contributor Tim Akinbo told CoinDesk.

Hence the solar panel that comes with the SpaceBox kit.

“This lack of regular electricity has denied most bitcoin enthusiasts in the continent the opportunity to participate in the global bitcoin multi-billion dollar industry as miners or routing node operators,” Chuta said. “By integrating [an] affordable solar power kit into bitcoin node operation, we expect that many more people across the world, especially Africans, can participate.”

Beyond electricity, Akinbo notes there are other costs to running a full node. They require a lot of storage space, for instance.

“It’s just untenable for most Africans at the moment,” Akinbo said, arguing that only wealthy bitcoins in Africa could afford a node.

But in Chuta’s vision, not everyone will necessarily run a node themselves. Perhaps there will be specialists that learn to run them, he said, who then pass the benefits on to their local community.

“The main point of this project … is to educate and train capable node operators across Africa, who then can help their small communities maintain ‘friends and family node’ in order to secure a healthy financial future for them,” Chuta said.

The halving event on May 11 saw the mining reward per block on bitcoin’s blockchain cut from 12.5 BTC to 6.25. The event was expected by many to accelerate the price uptrend from the low of $3,867 seen in March.

So far, though, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has failed to pick up a strong bid and continues to trade below $10,000 – a level seen two days ahead of the halving. Even so, larger investors, often called whales, continue to accumulate coins, as seen below.

As of Tuesday, the number of bitcoin whales, as represented by the tally of unique entities holding at least 1,000 coins, was 1,840. That’s up nearly 2% from the level of 1,811 observed on May 1, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The metric clocked a recent high of 1,844 on Monday, a level last seen in November 2017.

The steady accumulation since the halving suggests investor confidence in the long-term bullish narrative surrounding bitcoin.

Most analysts expect the cryptocurrency to rise sharply over the next 12 months on the back of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus delivered by authorities across the globe in the past three months. Bloomberg analysts said they expect bitcoin to challenge the record high of $20,000 by the end of 2020 on increased institutional participation.

For the whale metric, an entity refers to a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through Glassnode’s proprietary clustering algorithms.

Glassnode considers it a more reliable indicator of investor participation – the number of individuals or businesses using the network – compared to the traditional approach, which considers the number of addresses on the network as a proxy to the number of users/holders.

The latter method is weak because a single user can hold coins in multiple addresses, the firm says. The same is true for exchange addresses, which hold coins belonging to more than one individual.

What’s next for bitcoin?

Bitcoin’s current period in the doldrums could end with a bullish breakout above $10,000, given the steady accumulation by investors and other factors.

“We are bullish in the medium term with a target of $12,000, said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds. Dibb, however, believes the move to $12,000 would be preceded by a few weeks of erratic trading.

That possibility shouldn’t be ruled out, as bitcoin’s correlation with the equity markets has strengthened over the past week. The cryptocurrency fell sharply twice in the last week as stocks slipped over renewed coronavirus concerns.

“Bitcoin is currently trading as a ‘risk asset’ and will likely be subject to continued volatility as further US economic data is released in the coming days,” said Dibb.

While the immediate bull target is the psychological level of $10,000, support is seen at $8,900 (Monday’s low). A violation there would expose the next support lined up at $8,000.",2020-06-17 12:00:44+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/06/17/top-crypto-strategist-predicts-bitcoin-btc-will-surpass-20000-in-just-two-months-with-ethereum-leading-next-altcoin-rally/,"Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten says Bitcoin may be only a couple of months away from surpassing its all-time high of $20,000.

On a new episode of DataDash, Merten looks at the boom and bust cycles of the king cryptocurrency and says BTC is well-positioned to begin a parabolic rally.

“There’s a really interesting similarity that I’m seeing here when I take a look at the monthly chart of Bitcoin and the sense that has given me confidence that we’re just a couple of months away from getting back above $20,000.

The first thing I want to focus on is the longer-term chart, the expanding cycles. We talked about this: about how each new cycle usually expands by around 11 to 13 months. In this case, we added 12 months for the previous one just to keep it neutral and we’re expecting sometime in November 2022 to be the peak around $100,000.”

The crypto strategist says that his $100,000 BTC prediction is conservative, especially in comparison to other analysts who forecast Bitcoin surging as high $500,000.

Once BTC begins printing new highs, Merten believes a rising tide will lift all boats and spark a new altcoin season. The analyst says that the Bitcoin dominance chart is already flashing signals that are similar to the 2015 – 2017 altcoin bull market.

“I think this historical similarity is a good sign that we could be in an early stage of an altcoin cycle coming up here very soon. And not to mention, during this time period, even though the broader altcoin space hasn’t really kicked off yet, we have got from 72% to 66% for market dominance for Bitcoin. That’s gains for the altcoin space in general…

If you are in the right place here even in these early moves, you can benefit quite greatly if you start to make the right calls.”

Merten believes that the new altcoin spring will be spearheaded by Ethereum. He says the second-largest cryptocurrency is primed to erupt in a few months.

“What we want to look for is an eventual breakout above this wedge and a continuation of higher lows and higher highs. It looks like we’re formulating for that sometime around in the fall to the winter of 2020, lining up pretty close to our general estimations from what we can tell about altcoin dominance as well as Bitcoin.”

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,265 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.

At 00:00 UTC on Wednesday (8:00 p.m. Tuesday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,500 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. It then dipped 1.6% to as low as $9,348. The price is now below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages — a bearish signal for market technicians who study charts — but with little action, it looks to be going nowhere for the time being.

“The price of bitcoin managed to get only up to $9,600 Tuesday. Now fiat reigns,” said Constantine Kogan, crypto fund-of-funds BitBull Capital.

In fact, since the start of May the price of bitcoin has only appreciated 5.6% overall. It’s a relatively sleepy performance when compared to the oil market, which has had a wild 2020. A barrel of crude has gained over 90% since the beginning of May.

Oil is flat Wednesday, down 0.39% and priced at $37.71 as of press time.

Despite stimulus, bitcoin outpacing equities

Uncertain economic times still motivate cryptocurrency traders and investors to remain steadfast in their investment thesis on bitcoin. “I am personally not negative on bitcoin and my view is based on several ingredients that have not changed or improved my outlook,” said Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trader based in Sweden.

One element Kugelberg points to is the debasing of the U.S. dollar. Since 2000, the number of dollars in circulation has jumped over 240%, from $565 billion to almost $2 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data.

Other cryptocurrency advocates echo the same long-term outlook – that holding bitcoin is much better than owning traditional assets such as equities. Bitcoin is still up over 30% so far this year. Major global stock indices are either lower or just about even in 2020, and have been in negative territory since the middle of February.

George Clayton, managing partner of alternative asset fund Cryptanalysis Capital, says continued fiscal stimulus is just an attempt to push equities above the 0% return level, but with major long-term side effects on the value of U.S. dollar.

“A $1 trillion stimulus plan to build bridges, roads and rural 5G broadband that the Trump Administration is mulling over is perhaps the only piece of major legislation that stands a chance of passing both houses of Congress,” Clayton said. “It would be far more inflationary than the $500 billion in aid funneled to corporations that seems to be propping up stock markets.”

The Nikkei 225 of publicly traded companies in Japan closed the day flat, down 0.56% as real estate and transportation stocks dragged the index down.

The FTSE 100 index in Europe ended trading up 0.91% as energy stocks made gains.

The U.S. S&P 500 index lost 0.36%, dragged down by the retail and travel sectors.

The rise of tether on Ethereum since 2019 has shifted fee distributions on the network. With $5.7 billion of tether on Ethereum, the stablecoin has taken over fees paid by ERC20 contracts and even the network token itself, ether, according to data aggregator Glassnode.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has won a case in which it demanded that a Maryland couple liquidate their bitcoin to pay-off a $1.1 million tax debt.

Alexander and Laura Strashny proposed to the IRS to pay their 2017 tax liability, generated from non-crypto activities, in installments over a six-year period.

But after seeing the Strashny’s $7 million cryptocurrency fortune, the tax collector rejected the proposal, insisting that the couple sell a part of their bitcoin and immediately settle the debt in full.

The case was heard in a tax court in the state of Maryland on June 11. More taxes await the couple in the likely event it sells crypto to pay-off the debt. Bitcoin investors in the U.S. are taxed on profits generated from buying and selling of digital financial assets.

The ruling “shows how your cryptocurrency holdings could work against you in applying for an installment plan with the IRS and how – contrary to popular belief – regulators have oversight over your cryptocurrency portfolio,” said Shehan Chandrasekera, tax expert at Cointracker.

According to court papers, the Strashnys filed a 2017 tax return on time, but did not pay the $1.1 million tax charge, inclusive of penalties. In July 2018, the couple proposed to the IRS to pay-off their huge tax bill over six years.

To qualify for the installment plan, a taxpayer must also furnish the IRS with details about their source of income, personal assets, including cryptocurrency, as well as monthly expenses. So, the Strashnys filed a Collection Information Statement, also known as Form 433-A, for this purpose.

It is on this Form that the couple revealed its $7 million crypto cache. In addition to annual wages of $200,000, the Strashnys were also pocketing $19,000 each month from their digital assets investment. Now the IRS hit the family with a formal threat of seizure of wages and properties, as it waited for a response on the installment proposal The tax collector demanded full payment on time.

Eventually, the Strashnys requested a hearing. The tax court ruled that the couple was in a good financial position to pay off the $1.1 million tax debt by liquidating the crypto stash or borrowing U.S. dollars against the virtual currency.

“The outcome of this court case shows how cryptocurrency is not immune from regulatory oversight,” explained Chandrasekera.

“One might question why the cryptocurrency holdings were reported on Form 433-A in the first place. This IRS form is signed by the taxpayer under penalty and perjury. If the large holding of cryptocurrency were omitted from the form, this would have been a fraudulent filing and the consequences could have been much harsher,” he added.

There has been some confusion over whether India will ban cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, following recent reports of a note being circulated by the government. News.Bitcoin.com interviewed executives of five cryptocurrency exchange platforms in India to find out the truth about the news.

Indian Crypto Ban: What’s Likely?

Talks of the Indian government banning cryptocurrency have resurfaced following a report by the Economic Times of a note being circulated by the finance ministry regarding a crypto ban. However, the report is unverified and the news outlet only cited an unnamed government official as the source of the news. Nonetheless, it has many people associate the note with the draft bill submitted to the ministry last year by an interministerial committee that proposes a ban on cryptocurrency.

Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath explained to news.Bitcoin.com on Tuesday that “The movement of the note is the procedural next step after the committee has submitted the report mid last year.” Emphasizing that “This is also the needed step towards regulation for crypto in India,” he said:

A blanket ban is unlikely … Given that the supreme court did hear all aspects of crypto within India and abroad and have taken a stance to support the industry, the old report may be considered outdated. From the information that we have, the industry players will be invited to intervene while forming the regulation for crypto.

Wazirx CEO Nischal Shetty strongly believes that the Indian government will not ban cryptocurrency. He told news.Bitcoin.com Tuesday: “I’m positive that India will not take a regressive stance on crypto by putting a blanket ban. When it comes to regulation, I’m sure that India will follow the footsteps of developed countries like Japan, USA, UK, Australia, and more which have embraced crypto.”

Pointing out that “the news which is based on a note does not clarify whether the finance ministry intends to work upon the old draconian crypto bill or whether they plan to work on bringing a new bill,” he affirmed: “I don’t think there’s anything to worry about the note as of now.”

Another Indian crypto exchange’s CEO, Shivam Thakral of Buyucoin, also does not think the Indian government will take the approach of banning cryptocurrency. “I personally think that the Indian government would come out with certain crypto pro regulations very soon, they won’t ban cryptocurrency since India … is a part of G-20 [which] recommended its members to adopt FATF rules to regulate cryptocurrencies,” he told our newsdesk.

Giottus cofounder Arjun Vijay also shared with news.Bitcoin.com:

India generally looks for a precedent when it comes to creating complex laws. With none of the developed economies having banned cryptocurrencies, it is going to be very difficult for Indian government to roll out a feasible plan for banning cryptocurrencies completely.

Discussing the likelihood of a crypto ban in India, Vijay stated that the government is faced with two major issues. Firstly, “If India bans crypto, they need to be able to enforce the ban,” he remarked. “Because of the nature of the product, it would be very difficult for our government to track cryptocurrency holders and implement the ban. On the other hand, a regulation will grant them access to data with which they can efficiently govern/track/tax the cryptocurrency usage.” Secondly, he noted that “If India bans crypto, but crypto becomes mainstream, [India will be] missing out on millions of dollars of revenue and job creation opportunities.”

Coinswitch Chief Business Officer Sharan Nair reiterated to news.Bitcoin.com that “The news of a possible crypto ban in India is not a new development. This bill was proposed a year and a half back.” He opined: “What needs to be considered is that a lot of positive developments have happened in the Indian crypto space since then, namely the supreme court lifting the banking ban on crypto and multiple Indian crypto companies raising funds and ever-growing customer enthusiasm. We are hopeful that the authorised bodies would consult all stakeholders in this matter before coming to a decision.”

In March, the Indian supreme court quashed the banking ban by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), after many hearings. The RBI subsequently confirmed in a response to a Right to Information (RTI) application by Unocoin cofounder B.V. Harish that there is no ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses, or traders in India. The Indian government and the central bank have independently indicated that cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, is legal in India.

How Are Indians Reacting to the Crypto Ban Rumor?

The five exchange executives also shared with news.Bitcoin.com how Indians are reacting to reports of the possible ban on cryptocurrency and whether they are seeing any change in trading behavior on their platforms.

“There have been speculations about crypto ban in the past as well. There are more than 5 million crypto users in India, and I’m confident that our prime minister won’t let us down,” Wazirx’s CEO stressed, elaborating:

The day the news broke out created a mild panic among the community. However, we have not seen any difference in the trading behaviour on Wazirx since then.

Unocoin also has not seen any changes in trading activities on its platform. “We have not seen any change in the trading behavior but our customer care has received numerous calls asking our comments about the article. We continue to monitor the user activity on the platform since the news broke and now it is already a few days, it is unlikely to cause any noticeable change henceforth,” the CEO told news.Bitcoin.com.

The impact is also minimal at Coinswitch and Buyucoin. “We haven’t seen any changes in the trading behavior as such but there has been a lot of queries. Users want to know what will be the future course of action for them and for us as an exchange,” Coinswitch’s executive revealed.

“We didn’t see any impact of that news in the trading behavior and people on our platform are trading as usual also it was unverified news as the source was not identified and hence people didn’t take it seriously as similar news were out in the past,” Buyucoin’s CEO detailed.

Giottus’ cofounder expressed:

Similar news has come multiple times in the last four years, but nothing concrete has followed.

“So old hands are unfazed with this news and it has been business as usual for them,” the Giottus executive clarified. “For the new users, they are having some doubts regarding this proposal and we had to educate them on how the concept is still in its early stage and there is a long way ahead for this internal cabinet note to be converted into a bill. And in these tough times, the customers also understand that the government has other priorities.”

Effects a Crypto Ban Will Have on India

The exchange executives further shared their thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com on how a ban on cryptocurrency would affect India. Wazirx’s CEO asserted:

We’re in the middle of an economic meltdown, and millions of people have lost their jobs due to covid-19. Crypto is one of the very few sectors that is hiring today. It’s in India’s best interest to encourage such a fast growing sector. A ban would lead to projects and talent to move out of India, and affect the economy adversely.

He additionally described: “It will also discourage venture capitalists to invest in Indian startups. We don’t want that. Wazirx and Binance have a $50M fund exclusively to invest in Indian blockchain and crypto ecosystem. There will be many more funds that will be launched for crypto ecosystem in India. I’m sure our government wouldn’t want to lose out on such large capital investments in the country.”

Buyucoin’s CEO concurred, noting that “crypto adoption in India is increasing at a rapid pace, so banning it would be a complete loss of control over cryptocurrency-related activities and other monetary benefits Indian government could get.”

Unocoin’s CEO chimed in: “I would consider it to be very inefficient. Presently the significant crypto activity is happening through exchanges and every exchange is doing their KYC and AML checks which are forming anchor points on the blockchain. Crypto ban would push all activities underground. It would be like punishing the legitimate business and industry for being afraid of the bad actors.”

Coinswitch’s executive foresees a “drastic” effect. In his opinion, “Many companies will either shut shop or move to other countries with crypto-friendly laws. The whole innovation around public blockchain infra in India will come to a standstill. It will also have a futuristic impact on the global crypto/blockchain industry as India is an important market.”

Giottus’ cofounder outlined the effects of a crypto ban in some detail. “We see India losing out on multiple fronts if a ban is ultimately enforced in India,” he began. Firstly, he expects that “Some of the users will leave crypto forever, while some will continue trading in cash and become untraceable. This will lead to a parallel economy being created that is unregulated. Because of the very nature of crypto, it would be a big headache for law enforcement authorities to track and trade these activities.”

Secondly, he emphasized that “Indians will miss out on the biggest investment opportunity of this century, if bitcoin continues to do what it has been doing so far.” Moreover, he pointed out that “India is one of the major exporters of software services and this forms one of the biggest contributors of foreign exchange and tax revenue for the country. If crypto/dapps were to become mainstream, Indians will be missing out on a huge opportunity in terms of job creation and revenue.”

The cooperation between Binance and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is an early step in implementing industry best practices in the Indian crypto market, according to a press statement. India’s crypto sector has rapidly emerged after the lifting of a de facto ban in March 2020. Binance is now a member of the IAMAI’s crypto committee.

The IAMAI is a not-for-profit trade body of digital businesses operating within the country. Its role is to “expand and enhance the online and mobile value-added services sectors,” according to the body’s website.

Notably, the IAMAI led the petition that sought to overturn a crypto banking ban imposed by the country’s central bank in April 2018. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the crypto industry in March 2020.

“We warmly welcome Binance as a member of the Crypto Asset Committee of IAMAI,” Gaurav Chopra, vice president of IAMAI, said in a press release.

“Given their hands-on experience of regulatory compliance in various countries, we are excited to work with Binance and other industry players in developing a constructive policy framework for crypto assets in India, helping other exchanges operate in India compliantly and developing a strong framework to foster innovation while managing potential risks,” Chopra added.

IAMAI says it intends to work with regulators and policy-makers to build a sustainable policy framework for cryptocurrencies in India.

However, the announcement comes just days after rumors that India might be considering a new ban on crypto operations.

“Binance is honored and excited to join IAMAI and contribute our part in shaping the Indian blockchain industry for sustainable growth and development,” said Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. “We hope to further accelerate the progress of blockchain adoption in India and are committed to working with IAMAI on an innovation-led and progressive framework for digital assets and blockchain.”

According to a June 4 announcement, KE International secured $4 billion from investors for the first two phases of Akon City’s construction. Akon first announced plans to build the city in January. The firm has now confirmed the deal and added more details about the project.

A crypto-driven city

The first phase of Akon City’s development is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. By the end of this phase, the complex will include a mall, residences, hotels, a police station, a school, a waste facility, a solar power plant, and a hospital campus.

The second phase is expected to be completed in 2029 and is expected to deliver a complete city entirely running on the Akoin cryptocurrency. As Cointelegraph reported in mid-March, Akoin is a cryptocurrency designed for entrepreneurs in developing countries such as Africa.

KE International is also managing the construction of the $2 billion Mwale Medical and Technology City in Western Kenya. The project started in 2014 and is expected to be completed at the end of the year.

The complex is already 85% complete and includes a 5,000-bed hospital, which opened to the public last year. Interestingly, this hospital also partnered with Akon to leverage its Akoin cryptocurrency for transactions.",,https://www.coindesk.com/river-financial-seed-round-polychain-capital-square-crypto-steve-lee,"A slew of investors is backing bitcoin brokerage River Financial to the tune of $5.7 million.

Announced Wednesday, the San Francisco-based startup has closed a seed round joined by Polychain Capital, Slow Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, DG Lab Fund, Cygni, Pfeffer Capital and IDEO CoLab Ventures, according to a release from the firm. Several individual investors participated as well, said a River spokesman, including Steve Lee of Square Crypto.

Launched in 2019, River’s first funding round adds its name to a growing body of cryptocurrency asset managers, differentiated by focusing exclusively on the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Bitcoin is the heart and soul of the operation, said River co-founder and CEO Alex Leishman in a phone interview with CoinDesk. Leishman, who left Polychain to start the venture, said his fund wants to go in a “different direction” than Coinbase or other exchanges, hinting at criticisms leveled at retail exchanges for propping up little-known alternative cryptocurrencies.

“We do bitcoin better than any other financial institution,” Leishman said.

The fresh capital will be used for scaling River, particularly as it seeks licensing across the United States. The firm currently offers a spot market, cold-storage solution and private client product intended for family offices or high-net-worth individuals in 15 states with 25 more planned for this summer, Leishman said.

“We see River Financial as bridging the gap between traditional finance and Bitcoin,” Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee said in a statement. “The evolution of finance is only happening faster in the wake of the current global economic crisis, which has illuminated holes within traditional financial systems that can potentially be filled by Bitcoin.”

Big picture

Given macroeconomic uncertainties, River – like many other bitcoin firms – entered into 2020 strongly. The firm’s volume has increased 80% month over month since January and its client count has doubled over the same time period, Leishman said. The startup is eyeing profitability by year’s end, he added.

Notably, River’s consumer composition consists of a demographic most would likely not suspect: baby boomers. That generation makes up 77% of the firm’s market to date, Leishman said. Investors over 55 years of age are looking for a hedge against inflation given erratic U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Just like boomers getting into the bitcoin game late, River’s entrance into the bitcoin asset-manager space has led to underrated pay-offs, too.

Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark – an adviser to the firm – told CoinDesk that River has embraced novel bitcoin tech that has helped the firm scale more quickly.

Stark pointed to River’s integration with the Lightning Network as an example and said Leishman remains “at the forefront of bitcoin technology.” River also retains Blockstream co-founder Jonathan Wilkins as chief security officer (CSO), a January hire.

“There’s still a lot of Bitcoin legacy tech [in the market]. River is Bitcoin future tech,” Stark said.

Stark said first movers in the cryptocurrency market such as exchanges have often failed to implement scaling techniques, such as segregated witness (SegWit) or batching. These technical upgrades keep the network healthy, but also aid in the average user’s purchase experience.",2020-06-17 13:00:00+00:00,,,

Who Watches the Watchdogs?

The DEA failed to adequately police its undercover agents’ handling of cryptocurrency, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (IG). “The DEA’s management of virtual currency-related activities was insufficient due to inadequate headquarters management, lack of policies, inadequate internal control procedures, insufficient supervisory oversight and lack of training,” the IG wrote. Elsewhere, President Donald Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to focus on a clampdown on bitcoin over negotiating a trade with China, according to an excerpt from former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s new book.

Officials Weigh In

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking before the House Financial Services Committee, said the idea of a digital dollar should be taken seriously, adding later, “this is something that the central banks have to design… The private sector is not involved in creating the money supply, that’s something the central bank does.” Elsewhere, Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said XRP is more like an alternative currency than a security. He argued Ripple Labs hadn’t violated any U.S. securities regulations and should have the same legal status as bitcoin or ether. Halfway across the world, Russia’s Ministry of Justice criticized a new draft bill prohibiting crypto operations in the country, a week after the Ministry of Economic Development also opposed it. The bill is believed to be the brainchild of the country’s central bank, which has a prohibitive approach to crypto.

A district judge has denied two requests for subpoenas filed by iFinex, in its bid to track $850 million in user funds seized by authorities after bank accounts held by its payment processor, Crypto Capital, were frozen. It appears the subpoenas were filed in the wrong district. Elsewhere, Wirecard AG, a German payment processor and an issuer of Crypto.com and TenX debit cards, is unable to locate 1.9 billion euros (over $2 billion) worth of cash balances on its trust accounts, after an EY audit. The firm said a third party may have added “spurious” balances “in order to deceive the auditor,” The Block reports. Finally, a new report shows that cryptocurrency is not a significant trend in terror financing in the Middle East. However, a new round of U.S. sanctions aimed at Syria may tip the scales in favor of experimentation.

Platform Growth

Polkadot has announced a proof-of-concept token redeemable for bitcoin (BTC). Designed by Interlay, the system will lock BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint a PolkaBTC token on Polkadot, in effort to boost the interoperability of the network. Elsewhere, the South Korean soccer association K League announced a licensing agreement with the blockchain enabled fantasy soccer platform Sorare to enable fans to collect and trade digital tokens representing league players and use them to play fantasy soccer games run by the firm.

Quarterly Slump

Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer Ebang estimates it incurred a net loss of $2.5 million on a revenue of $6.4 million for Q1 2020. In an SEC filing ahead of the company’s proposed public listing, Ebang said revenue grew 6.1% annually, while incurring $5.9 million in cost of revenues, in addition to other operational expenses. Ebang is applying to list on the Nasdaq exchange and anticipates its IPO launch price will be between $4.5 and $6.5 for each of the 19.3 million Class A ordinary shares offered, for a market value of around $800 million.

Grants

Crypto exchanges OKCoin and BitMEX recently partnered to provide a $150,000 grant to Bitcoin Core contributor Amiti Uttarwar, an alumna of Coinbase and Xapo, to build out privacy features. Elsewhere, the Ethereum Foundation followed up on its 2019 gift to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) this week with a second cryptocurrency donation. UNICEF said the fund is accepting applications from startups in emerging markets to receive investments via this second donation of roughly 1,125 ether (~$262,000). So far, UNICEF has invested crypto in nine startups in Mexico, India, Turkey, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Finally, Binance has joined an Indian tech industry association to help set best practices in the Indian crypto market. The Internet and Mobile Association of India helped overturn the nation’s crypto banking ban earlier this year.

Is Bitcoin Undervalued?

Bitcoin is trading near $9,450, up nearly 47% this quarter and 145% from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13. Despite the rise, bitcoin’s Mayer multiple – the ratio of the cryptocurrency’s price to its 200-day moving average – currently stands at 1.15, according to MayerMultiple.info. A below-2.4 ratio indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued.

Opinion

Crypto’s Convergence

Ajit Tripathi, CoinDesk columnist and an executive director at Binance, said the worlds of crypto, fiat and finance are converging. “A new way of thinking about money, banking and economics has inspired banks and regulators to take a fresh look at whether or how the monetary system is working for society at large. As the pace of digital assets and fiat systems coming together accelerates, I hope a world will emerge where customers have greater financial freedom, wider choice and increased access to capital, payment systems and investments than they have today,” he said.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-06-18 16:09:36+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-undervalued-q2-rally-price-cryptocurrency,"Bitcoin remains a bargain despite having carved out solid gains in the second quarter, according to one price metric.

At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $9,450 – up nearly 47% so far this quarter and has gained 145% from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price.

Despite the recent rise, bitcoin’s Mayer multiple – the ratio of the cryptocurrency’s price to its 200-day moving average – currently stands at 1.15, according to MayerMultiple.info.

A below-2.4 ratio indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued. Once the ratio rises above that level, it indicates that bitcoin may be overbought and a speculative bull frenzy has set in. That often leads to a price bubble and a subsequent crash.

Source: MayerMultiple.info

For instance, the ratio rose above 2.4 on Dec. 1, 2017, following which bitcoin doubled in value to $20,000 in just two weeks only to fall back to $12,000 on Dec. 22. Similarly, an above-2.4 ratio marked market tops in April 2013 and December 2013.

So, with the ratio currently down more than 50% from the key 2.4 level, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side – more so, as bitcoin’s Mayer multiple is still below its lifetime average of 1.44.

The ratio has been higher than the current level of 1.15 nearly 52% of the time, as noted by Mayer Multiple’s twitter handle. “This is a good time to stack sats,” tweeted Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company, referring to satoshis, small divisions of a bitcoin.

Simulations performed by Mayer Multiple’s founder Trace Mayer show that in the past an investor would have achieved better results by accumulating bitcoin when the ratio was below 2.4.

That said, the Mayer multiple is a technical analysis tool and its accuracy in predicting undervalued/overvalued conditions is not guaranteed.

And expecting past performance to hold consistent for future performance is risky as market conditions change. For instance, bitcoin’s correlation with the equity markets has strengthened this year and the cryptocurrency may suffer sharp losses if stocks crash on renewed coronavirus fears.

However, on-chain activity is supportive of the bullish picture painted by the Mayer multiple. The number of bitcoin whales or entities holding more than 1,000 coins recently rose to 1,844, the highest level since November 2017, as noted on Wednesday.

Retail interest, too, is at record highs, as tweeted by Ciara Sun, head of global business and markets and vice president at cryptocurrency exchange Huobi.

The continued accumulation of bitcoin by both retail and large investors indicates confidence in the long-term bullish narrative surrounding bitcoin. Whether that confidence is justified, only time will tell.",2020-06-18 11:29:50+00:00,https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/xrp/crypto-dad-chris-giancarlo-xrp-is-not-a-security/,"Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair and “Crypto Dad” Chris Giancarlo argued forcefully on Wednesday that XRP is not a security but a currency under U.S. law.

That’s a huge, potentially life-or-death question for Ripple, the international payments firm that holds more than half of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Ripple wants to get remittances to Mexico faster with XRP (Photo: Shutterstock).

Ripple has been bedeviled by accusations and civil lawsuits claiming that XRP is a security created by Ripple rather than a commodity or currency. If a court or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled against Ripple, it would essentially turn the company’s sale of XRP into an ongoing, illegal securities offering.

Depending on the findings, such a settlement could cripple XRP’s usefulness as a utility token used to make financial settlements and provide liquidity for cross-border transactions, and damage or even kill Ripple.

Which isn’t to say it would. The SEC let Block.one settle charges that its $4 billion initial coin offering (ICO) was an illegal securities sale for just $24 million. By contrast, Telegram’s attempt to get around SEC rules for its TON blockchain led to a lawsuit that threatened to drag on so long the project was abandoned, and investors lost more than a quarter of the $1.7 billion raised.

In both cases, and similar ones, having a blockchain up and running was a big factor in the SEC’s willingness to settle charges on reasonable terms. Ripple is in good shape on that front, working with more than 300 banks in 40 countries including Banco Santander, American Express, and MoneyGram.

[Editor’s Note: Ken Kurson, the founder of Modern Consensus, sits on the board of Ripple.]

When Crypto Dad speaks

While the Ripple has made the same arguments before, Giancarlo’s voice—in the form of a June 17 column for the International Financial Law Review—carries weight. The former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) remains hugely popular in the crypto community for his support of bitcoin and ether at a time when digital assets had very few friends among U.S. regulators. Giancarlo, whose term expired in April 2019, has a highly regarded and credible voice with regulators and elected officials.

Anderson Kill attorney Preston Byrne isn’t buying what Chris Giancarlo is selling (Photo: Twitter)

He has also remained active in the cryptocurrency industry, launching the Digital Dollar Project to advocate for the creation of a U.S. central bank-issued digital currency, similar to the digital yuan China is already testing in several cities. Giancarlo also joined the advisory board of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On the other hand, Giancarlo is also an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where he has a number of clients in the cryptocurrency industry, including Ripple.

Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Anderson Kill, highlighted Giancarlo’s conflict on Twitter: “The only problem is he’s no longer a regulator. In fact, he’s on the payroll of Ripple, the largest single owner of XRP, whose co-founders actually created the cryptocurrency.”

Howey: XRP is not a security

The argument over whether XRP—and almost every token issued via ICO or its variants—is a security boils down to one four-part question, called the Howey test. Based on a Supreme Court decision, Howey is the benchmark the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses to determine if something offered for sale is a security that falls under its jurisdiction.

The Howey test has four prongs that must all be met for a sale to be considered a security: When “a person (1) invests his money in a (2) common enterprise and is led to (3) expect profits solely from the (4) efforts of the promoter or a third party” they are purchasing an “investment contract”—a security.

In the column that ran in the International Financial Law review on June 17, “Cryptocurrencies and U.S. Securities Laws: Beyond Bitcoin and Ether,” Giancarlo and his law partner and co-author, Conrad Bahlke, went through the pro-Ripple case one at a time:

On the investment in a common enterprise front, Giancarlo and Bahlke argue that the vast majority of XRP holders have no involvement with Ripple, which only contracts with banks and money transmitters like MoneyGram to make sending funds between different countries and currencies nearly instantaneous and extremely cheap compared to the current interbank settlement method.

And while non-Ripple XRP holders are investing money, they are not investing with Ripple, the argument goes. “The mere fact that an individual holds XRP does not create any relationship, rights or privileges with respect to Ripple any more than owning ether would create a contract with the Ethereum Foundation, the organization that oversees the Ethereum architecture,” according to the pair.

That said, if Ripple is successful the value of XRP should go up for everyone. And with more than 55 billion of the total existing 100 billion XRP in Ripple’s hands, it is the 800-pound gorilla in the XRP room.

Where it gets muddier is that several Ripple co-founders created the company behind XRP’s blockchain, which minted all 100 billion tokens in the genesis block. They then gave a huge chunk to Ripple, which they also owned.

It’s worth noting that While Ripple controls more than half of all XRP, the now-decentralized blockchain requires an 80% supermajority to reverse transactions, so Ripple cannot commit a 51% attack on XRP, according to Giancarlo and Bahlke. That said, it can certainly veto changes.

As far as having a reasonable expectation of profit from the efforts of Ripple, Giancarlo and Bahlke argued that “Ripple has repeatedly emphasized the functionality of XRP as a liquidity tool and a settlement mechanism,” not an investment.

“The fact that certain parties may acquire XRP with the hope that it may appreciate in value” gives them different interests than Ripple, they added.",2020-06-18 11:01:44+00:00,https://www.ibtimes.com/bitcoin-not-part-top-10-cryptocurrencies-china-says-2996898,"KEY POINTS Bitcoin ranks 12th in new Chinese cryptocurrency rankings but ranks first in creativity and innovation

EOS and Tron tops the list despite reported decreased developer activity

Many public blockchains has had few developer updates, likely due to COVID-19

Bitcoin is not the top cryptocurrency, according to a new Chinese report that ranked global cryptocurrencies based on their technical merits. Ironically, one of the coins on top of the rankings had a long tense history with Chinese authorities.

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) of China published the 18th edition of the CCID Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index, local news outlet ChainNews reported. The tokens are judged based on their blockchain’s basic tech, applicability and creativity. Basic tech evaluates the function, performance, and security of the blockchain; applicability evaluates if these blockchains support actual applications; creativity or innovation refers to developer scale, code update, and code influence.

Notably, Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ranked 12th, up just two places from the previous evaluation. Cointelegraph reported the top five tokens remained the same from the previous evaluation -- EOS, Tron, Ethereum, IOST and Link. IOST topped the list in terms of basic tech. Predictably, Ethereum ranked first in applications, and Bitcoin ranked first in creativity.

Chainnews noted for the period of March-May 2020 updates to many public blockchain projects have slowed down while major updates decreased significantly. This conclusion is also reported by blockchain and artificial intelligence investment firm Outlier Ventures on their paper “Blockchain Developer Report for Q2 2020”. According to the research, major protocols saw a moderate decline in developer activity, likely due to COVID-19. Weekly code updates for EOS and Tron decreased by 94% and 96% respectively. On the CCID list, both tokens, while they ranked high overall, were lower in the “Creativity” category.

EOS -- dubbed earlier in its life as the ""Ethereum Killer"" -- is facing problems with developers and users departing in droves, news outlet Decrypt reported in May. Outlier Ventures said this is likely the result of interest in the blockchain falling after its main network launch, and, more importantly, its “core developers leaving.”

Tron, which ranked second in the CCID list, had a tense relationship last year with China when authorities raided its Beijing office. Its founder Justin Sun maintained the incident was fake news. Amid reports of him being investigated by Chinese regulators, Sun posted on Chinese social network Weibo, apologizing for the “overmarketing” of the Tron Foundation.

Outlier Ventures did say some chains saw dramatic increase in developer activity. Among them are Polkadot (+44%), Cosmos (+15%), Theta (+931%) and Cardano (+580%). Notable, only Cosmos (ATOM) and Cardano (ADA) appeared on the CCID listing, ranked 21st, and 32nd respectively. However, the report from Chainnews did not say whether the CCID took into account all the coins in the listing, considering there are hundreds of tokens and blockchains currently in development.",2020-06-18 23:47:44-04:00,https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16300418/floodgates-open-for-big-institutional-investors-to-pour-into-bitcoin,"Authored by Juan Villaverde and Bruce Ng

Why pay attention to what hedge funds, university endowments, pension funds and other big-foot institutional investors are doing?

Because that’s where the big money is. And Bitcoin is one of the only cryptocurrencies big and liquid enough to absorb institutional-sized capital inflows.

There's just one problem. Few institutional investors have governing charters that allow them to buy cryptocurrencies. But almost all of them can buy common stocks.

And now, an SEC-registered, closed-end fund is opening the door for all these institutions to invest in crypto.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares — each equivalent to 0.00096086 BTC — trade freely over-the-counter, so anyone can buy them.

This is a very big deal. It reminds us of what happened to gold prices after the first gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) opened the door for investors to buy bullion in the stock market.

Gold prices quadrupled in seven years.

And you should look for even bigger gains as GBTC opens the floodgates for anyone to buy Bitcoin ""in the stock market.""

Roughly 88% GBTC shareholders are big banks, hedge funds, and big-foot professional investors. That makes money flowing into it is one of the best indicators of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.

Big-Foot Institutional Investors Quietly

Shovelling Money into Bitcoin

Figure 2 shows the weekly flow of funds into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust from April 2019 to March 2020.

Between the third quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, the amount invested in more than doubled — from $388.9 million to $818.5 million.

This is further confirmed by anecdotal reports the ""smart money"" on Wall Street is finally starting to pour money into crypto.

For example, legendary trader and Forbes 400 billionaire Paul Tudor Jones recently told CNBC he's putting 1% to 2% of his assets in Bitcoin.

Based on the size of his hedge fund (Tudor BVI — with $21 billion in assets under management) that comes to a whopping $210 million and $420 million.

And with the Federal Reserve printing $2.9 trillion in just 13 weeks, this river of paper money seems set to flow even faster going forward.

The Case for Bitcoin at $180,000

For centuries, investors losing confidence in paper currencies have turned to gold as a store-of-value. But now, there's a new kid on the block: Bitcoin.

Like gold, Bitcoin is scarce. It has a hard ceiling on the maximum number of coins that can ever be created. But gold is heavy (70% heavier than lead). To transport it you need to hire guards with guns.

Plus, you need an expensive steel vault for safe storage. And even then, nothing keeps a hostile government from sending soldiers to seize it.

By contrast, Bitcoin is weightless. It moves via the Internet at the speed of light — at near zero cost. And unlike gold, it is virtually unconfiscatable.

The only physical manifestations of your Bitcoin ownership are the character strings that comprise your wallet address and private key.

Never has a financial asset been more easily concealable — than this.

Advantages like these arguably make Bitcoin a better safe-haven investment than gold itself.

Yet Bitcoin's total market cap is only $175 billion. A mere pittance compared to the world's above-ground hoard of gold — which weighs in at a hefty $9 trillion.

But as the financial world discovers Bitcoin's true potential as safe haven asset, it's going to have a lot of catching up to do.

How far up can it go?

Well, if Bitcoin captures only a third of gold's safe-haven business, it's going be trading near $180,000 — roughly a 20-fold increase from present levels.

Bottom line: If you think unlimited money-printing is going to send safe-haven assets blasting up — which is clearly what GBTC and Paul Tudor Jones are betting on — Bitcoin is the one safe-haven asset with the most profit potential.

Best,

Juan and Bruce

The nation’s Ministry of Justice opposed the draft new regulation Tuesday, a week after the Ministry of Economic Development also criticized it. The bill was introduced by lawmakers in March but is broadly believed to be the brainchild of the country’s central bank, which has a prohibitive approach to crypto. The proposal met some harsh reviews from Russia’s crypto community after being unveiled.

According to Russian newspaper Izvestia, Deputy Minister of Justice Denis Novak prepared the ministry’s comment for the draft bill, criticizing the proposal’s inconsistency.

The ministry’s press office confirmed to CoinDesk he wrote the response, adding his feedback was sent to the Digital Economy think tank, which is working with the government on policy issues.

The bill sets out that Russians should not be able to use the nation’s infrastructure to conduct any operations with cryptocurrency, but individuals are allowed to inherit coins or accept them as the result of a counterparty’s bankruptcy process.

Crypto can also be seized like any other type of property with a court warrant.

The justice ministry pointed out, though, it’s not clear what courts would be able to do with confiscated crypto. Normally, marshals would sell seized property at auctions, but if all crypto transactions are illegal in Russia this wouldn’t be possible.

Instead, the ministry suggests choosing a government body that will be allowed to help Russians sell crypto abroad.",2020-06-18 08:00:45+00:00,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/82959/boerse-stuttgarts-crypto-app-bison-begins-trading-in-bitcoin-cash,"Source: Boerse Stuttgart

Novogratz, a Wall Street veteran, loves a compelling narrative. “Bitcoin specifically is a story about adoption,” he said a few minutes into our call. “And the next big group that’s going to adopt bitcoin as a store of value, as a digital gold, are the financial advisers.”

Earlier this week, Galaxy Digital announced it had partnered with the educational arm of CAIS, a financial product platform that specializes in connecting institutional investors – financial advisers, hedge funds, private equity – to alternative investments and products.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The tie-up will see Galaxy provide educational content about crypto to wealth managers and financial advisors. Although the course will offer material on the broader digital asset space, as well as on the emerging market infrastructure, it will revolve around bitcoin.

It’s a “really sweet partnership,” Novogratz said. Galaxy can make bitcoin’s investment case directly to the strata of society that controls most of the country’s wealth. “CAIS is spectacularly situated to help us educate them and then connect with them to sell our products.”

Indeed, going back to the narrative, Novogratz has long believed institutional involvement was the natural next step for crypto. While it may have started out as a “retail-driven, people’s revolution,” he predicted institutions would always get involved as the asset class grew in size.

Novogratz saw a gap. As a crypto merchant bank, Galaxy offers clients asset management and advisory services; it uses its own capital to trade and invest in the space. It would become the bridge, allowing traditional capital to flow into the nascent crypto space.

While Galaxy got off to a flying start, such as a high-profile investment into Block.one, the bank’s performance over the past two years has been anything but spectacular.

My mom told me money doesn't grow on trees, and right now it's growing on trees.

In fact, Galaxy has failed to turn a profit since its launch: it lost a whopping $272.7 million in its first full year of operation. It rode the market rebound in the summer of 2019, but still lost $97 million in Q4 2019. Losses stemming from the its trading arm have wiped out its other revenue streams. A pear-shaped investment into WAX, a gaming token, for example, lost the firm as much as $47 million

In order to keep itself going, Galaxy has been forced to shrink its workforce by 15%. But it may not be out of the woods yet. The bank warned earlier this year that the coronavirus outbreak would likely contribute to a further hit to revenue.

Novogratz is confident, however, that institutions can help turn his company’s fortunes around. It has taken longer than expected, he admits, but says he has this “intuition” that there’s “going to be a big [institutional] take up in the next six to 24 months.”

See also: Binance Launching Crypto Exchange in the UK

What makes him so sure? It’s all about the narrative, he said.

“We would not be having this conversation if, you know, [the U.S.] budget deficit was going from 4% to 2% and everything looked hunky-dory,” he said. “In one week after the coronavirus crisis started, the [Federal Reserve] did more QE than it did in the entire 2008-2009 episode.”

“My mom told me money doesn’t grow on trees, and right now it’s growing on trees,” he said.

Novogratz belongs to the school of thought that sees bitcoin ultimately becoming the digital equivalent to gold: a store of value, uncorrelated to the traditional markets. As such, this darkening macro backdrop is “fantastic” for the story of bitcoin.

The smart money is buying bitcoin as a macro hedge, Novogratz said. Paul Tudor Jones, he says, is a perfect example of a well-known figure from the traditional space, who has seen the narrative and has begun allocating bitcoin to his fund. And that could open the flood gates for other institutions.

Indeed, it does feel like institutional investors are getting more interested in bitcoin. Last Month, Fidelity found that 80% of those surveyed found the asset class appealing. The likes of Coinbase, Gemini and BitGo are racing to launch prime brokerages for an institutional crowd.

“The drumbeat from the financial advisory committee on wanting to learn more about bitcoin and blockchain has been increasing,” said Matt Brown, founder and CEO of CAIS.

Which brings us back to why Galaxy is getting involved in CAIS. Novogratz said most of the content they plan to use had already been developed over the past three years. It had been collecting dust till last week. When they had tried to publish it before, institutions simply weren’t interested.

Novogratz says now is the perfect opportunity to use his course to proselytize about bitcoin and drive home the narrative that bitcoin is the new gold. “This education piece is selling the story,” getting institutional investors comfortable with the asset so they’ll potentially encourage other institutions to do the same, he said.

Crucially, it will also provide Galaxy with the opportunity to connect with thousands of financial advisors who, between them, control more than a trillion dollars in wealth.

Looking back, Novogratz realizes Galaxy Digital, as a bridge for institutions into crypto, came too early. “Quite frankly,” he said, “the consumer business was the easier play.” Even now, businesses such as exchanges, wallets, and platform providers, which cater for a retail audience, are, in his mind, still performing best in crypto.

But by talking to investors about the “bitcoin story,” Novogratz wants to be a key part of a sea change. His partnership with CAIS, he said, could be the “first big leg of more traditional capital coming into the space.”

“It’s taken longer to get there than I thought it would, but it feels like we’re finally through the starting line and starting to gain some pace.”

But, CoinDesk asked, what happens if bitcoin doesn’t become this great institutional asset? If, after educating financial firms about crypto for a whole year, few roll their sleeves up and get involved?",2020-06-18 16:21:02+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/polkadot-is-latest-blockchain-to-explore-redeemable-bitcoin-tokens,"The latest blockchain to announce a token redeemable for bitcoin (BTC) is Polkadot.

It’s only a proof-of-concept at this point and Polkadot is running but not usable yet, but a company called Interlay has designed a model under a Web3 Foundation grant for locking BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and minting what it’s calling PolkaBTC on Polkadot.

If Polkadot does prove to be a meeting place for different blockchains, then the interoperability project will have to touch the original crypto asset, and that’s bitcoin.

“Bitcoin is the asset with the most liquidity and hence we believe there is a natural demand for BTC on platforms that offer DeFi products and other features that are not natively supported in Bitcoin,” Alexei Zamyatin, CEO of Interlay, told CoinDesk in an email. Interlay works to make decentralized finance (DeFi) products interoperable.

The model deployed has similarities to the model Keep used in launching its tBTC system. A smart contract on Polkadot controls a key to a wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain and verifies its contents using simplified payment verification (SPV). That wallet is collateralized with Polkadot’s native token, DOT, which the initial design sets at 200%, though this could change. Once it verifies that the BTC is present in the wallet it controls, it issues PolkaBTC equivalent to the amount deposited.

It’s important to note here the proof-of-concept describes how it would be done, not who would do it. Different entities would be able to set up vaults to issue PolkaBTC, earning income as the tokens are issued and redeemed.

This also makes it a marked contrast from, for example, wBTC on Ethereum, which is entirely under the centralized control of BitGo, as the sole custodian and issuer.

Motivation

Once a PolkaBTC is created, that new token can be used throughout the Polkadot network and any holder of PolkaBTC can redeem it for actual BTC at any time. The BTC locked on Polkadot is monitored by the BTC-Relay announced by Interlay in April.

A key difference between BTC on Polkadot and on Ethereum is that Polkadot is building it ahead of the use cases. There are no DeFi products as yet ready to enlist PolkaBTC for uses such as lending or collateral.

“While Etheruem is without question the market leader, there are quite a few projects on Polkadot that are preparing to offer DeFi products,” Zamyatin noted. He listed Katal, which will enable selling future cash flows, and Acala, a stablecoin platform that could use PolkaBTC as a form of collateral.

Interlay is itself going to create a derivatives platform on which PolkaBTC could be useful.

That said, using wBTC as the main example of the original cryptocurrency on another chain, without a real use case the market showed relatively little interest in bridging the two chains.

Looking at BitGo’s record of supply verifications, the wBTC supply hovered between 100 and 600 before wBTC was accepted as a form of collateral on MakerDAO on May 3, 2020. Since then, it has consistently been over 1,000, with a current supply of 4,095 wBTC.

The seven-day average of the total amount of bitcoin transferred out of miners’ addresses declined to 987 on Thursday, hitting the lowest level since Feb. 3, 2010, according to data source Glassnode. The previous decade low of 988 was registered on May 23.

The number of coins being sent by miners to exchanges is also at its lowest point in over a year, as noted by Glassnode in its weekly report.

“It is a sign of efficient miners continuing to hoard (only selling a proportion of BTC),” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital.

The increase in miner holding does not necessarily have long-term bullish implications for the cryptocurrency’s price. Miners tend to operate mainly on cash and liquidate their holdings almost on a daily basis to fund operations.

As such, miner hoarding could be termed as temporary deferral of BTC sales, possibly due to fears that the market lacks the strength to absorb the regular amount of supply. Essentially, they may be waiting for the market to show strength and prices to rise before realizing their profits.

The market, therefore, could face an above-normal miner supply during the next meaningful price rise. That, in turn, could put the brakes on a price rally.

Hoarding aside, the other main reason for the decline in outflows is the reduction in bitcoin being mined since May’s reward halving, said Ahmad.

Source: Glassnode

Indeed, transfer volume from miner addresses fell from 2,334 BTC to 1,034 BTC in the nine days following the May 11 reward halving, which reduced the per block emission by 50% to 6.25 BTC.

That sharp decline in profitability forced out less inefficient miners, as evidenced by a drop in the seven-day average of the hash rate – the total computing power dedicated to mining blocks on the blockchain. That fell from 120 tera hashes per second (TH/s) to 90 TH/s in the two weeks following halving (though it’s since climbed as more efficient machines were switched on).

Forced out miners, however, may return to bitcoin’s blockchain if prices rise sharply, making older hardware once again profitable.

Bitcoin is currently trading largely unchanged on the day near $9,370, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The exchange released the results of its poll on Twitter. It shows that BTC is the favorite crypto asset among 26% of respondents, with XRP behind by one percentage point, at 25%.

Ethereum clocks in at a distant third, with 9% of the vote. The remaining 40% is made up of various altcoins including NEM, Mona, Nano, Chainlink and Chiliz.

A total of 1,498 people participated in the survey.

The Japanese messaging giant Line launched Bitmax in September of last year after receiving approval from the country’s Financial Services Agency.

The results of the survey line up with data from the Japanese crypto exchange JVCEA, which reported that Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum, ranked first, second and third as the most popular coins on its platform throughout 2019.

The three coins are on very different trajectories in 2020. This year, Bitcoin has rallied from $7,203 to $9,391 – a 30% increase. Ethereum has moved from $130.67 to $229.30 – a 75% increase. Meanwhile, XRP has remained flat and is now exactly where it began at the start of the year, at $0.19.

Analyzing the most popular coins by global trading volume reveals a very different story.

According to CoinMarketCap, the most popular coin by volume is Tether, followed by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS and XRP.

According to the table published by local media outlet Chainnews, Bitcoin (BTC) was placed in the 12th place with 106.2 points.

The criteria used to evaluate cryptocurrencies include basic technology, applicability, features, performance, safety, creativity, and decentralization.

At the top of the table is EOS with 156.1 points, followed by TRON with 138.43 points and Ethereum (ETH) with 136.4 points. The leading cryptocurrency scores 20.4 points in applicability and 24.7 in creativity, while the second-place crypto has 28.4 and 15.5 points, respectively.

The fourth and fifth in the rankings are IOST and LSK with 130.3 and 119.3 points, respectively. XRP is in 14th place with only 105 points.

Interestingly, Bitcoin is even lower down the list than in the previous ranking, at 17th place. At that time, it had a rating of only 43 points in terms of innovation and 19.9 for applicability.

Tron’s founder and CEO, Justin Sun, warned that Chinese authorities raised suspicions over the platform’s legal status. This has led to a tense relationship with Chinese authorities for Sun in recent days.

In 2019, an incident involving Tron led to Chinese police surrounding the project’s office in Beijing. Media outlets at the time claimed that Tron’s office was raided by police, but Sun indicated that this was “fake news.”",2020-06-19 08:31:17+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-fiat-new-york-federal-reserve,"Economists with the New York Federal Reserve do not think bitcoin is a new kind of money.

Bitcoin, the decentralized, permissionless, trustless digital value system that an anonymous programmer created over a decade ago is “just another example of fiat money,” said Michael Lee and Antoine Martin in a Thursday blog post.

“Bitcoin may be money, but it is not a new type of money,” they said. Dollar bills are fiat, gigantic limestone wheels were once fiat and bitcoin is fiat as well, they said.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Their argument appeared to employ a definition of fiat money as being an intrinsically worthless object whose sole value derives from the bearer’s belief he or she can use it for goods.

But such a definition misclassifies the nature of bitcoin by botching the very meaning of fiat, said Nic Carter, a partner at the blockchain-focused Castle Island Ventures and frequent crypto commentator (including for CoinDesk).

Carter said fiat currency, such as dollar bills, has value because the issuing authority says so. But that is not at all the case with bitcoin, he said.

“I don’t know if their intent is to denigrate bitcoin but it comes off that way,” Carter said of the NY Fed economists. In a tweet he called the Fed’s argument “insane.”

What is bitcoin?

Martin and Lee posit that the Bitcoin ecosystem’s true newness lies in the novel “exchange mechanism” it spawned. “The ability to make electronic exchanges without a trusted party – a defining characteristic of Bitcoin – is radically new,” they said.

Simply put, there had never been a true means to conduct “electronic transfers without a third party” before Bitcoin came around, they said. Yes, central banks and commercial banks and an ecosystem of financial products all allowed money to flow electronically before. But those all worked because a third party said so. They said that’s not the case with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s innovation permits an ensuing wave of similarly trustless monies to foster and grow: stablecoins, initial coin offerings as well as unexpected assets, like CryptoKitties, they point out. But they also argue that none of those are new forms of money either.

“It is more accurate to think of Bitcoin as a new type of exchange mechanism that can support the transfer of monies as well as other things,” they said.

Carter agrees Bitcoin gave the world a new way to move money, challenged the authors’ assertion the Bitcoin blockchain should harbor other assets and said it was impossible to divorce bitcoin’s monied nature from the mechanism it exists upon.

“The monetary qualities are also essential. That was clear in the way Satoshi described” its limited supply, he said.

The economists concluded it’s important to define what is actually new about bitcoin for historical reasons.",2020-06-19 19:55:07+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/68944/ey-launches-crypto-app-that-helps-with-tax-filings,"“Big Four” professional consulting firm Ernst & Young (EY) has launched a web-based cryptocurrency application that helps its U.S. users with tax filings.

Called CryptoPrep, the app allows users to aggregate their crypto transactions and calculate capital gains or losses for Form 8949 of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Users can provide EY a CSV file containing crypto transactions, or manually enter their transaction history in the app. They can also provide “read-only” access to API (application programming interface) keys from their crypto exchanges.

EY said it does not store API keys. “We use your keys to pull your transaction history and then we delete them.” So, “we do not have access to your cryptocurrency, only a history of your transactions.”

The CryptoPrep app supports over 1,000 coins and “most popular exchanges.” EY did not specify those exchanges. The app also allows users to add transactions from unsupported exchanges by selecting the ”Other” tile from the ”Sync Exchange” view within the app.

Once users have completed inputting their crypto trading transactions, the app allows users to download a draft Form 8949 and a CSV file detailing their transactions. The service, of course, comes at a cost.

For up to 20 transactions, the cost is $49. For 21–100 transactions, the cost goes up to $99, and for 101–999 transactions, it goes up to $399. For transactions beyond that threshold, EY offers individually priced services.

“Our clients increasingly hold and trade crypto assets, creating the need for an innovative solution to address the evolving complexity around filing crypto taxes,” said Marna Ricker, vice-chair of tax services at EY Americas. She added that the CryptoPrep app is created by the EY Foundry, the company’s internal corporate venturing unit.

EY is not the only firm to help U.S. users file crypto taxes. Winklevoss Capital-backed TaxBit also allows users to prepare Form 8949.

But it’s an open question whether the blockchain platform and its enthusiastic community can take the wider world into the next era: the decentralized equivalent of the industrial revolution.

As Ethereum prepares to celebrate the five-year anniversary of its mainnet launch on July 31, billions of dollars in value rest on that question. Specifically, on whether the all-important Ethereum 2.0 scaling project can be successfully launched and integrated into its existing architecture.

You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.

The growth is found in a variety of Ethereum-based applications.

Take decentralized finance, for starters. With the locked value in DeFi applications now above $1 billion, there’s an increasing array of products servicing this burgeoning ecosystem. This week, we learned of the successful launch of decentralized lender Compound’s new COMP token and that Nexus Mutual, a decentralized insurance provider to protect users against smart contract breaches, saw its pooled funds double to more than $4 million over the past 90 days.

There’s been similar growth in Ethereum-based stablecoins. This is dominated by dollar-pegged token Tether, which is widely used as a settlement and clearing mechanism by cryptocurrency exchanges and has seen spectacular issuance this year. As we reported in Money Reimagined two weeks ago, nascent demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins such as USDC is emerging in dollar-starved developing countries, where it’s being used for remittances and day-to-day payments.

Apart from these financial use cases, there are also healthy growth indicators in the software development economy that has arisen around Ethereum. For instance, the worldwide community of developers tapping into bug bounties and other projects funded through Gitcoin, an Ethereum-focused marketplace for open-source engineering work, has grown to almost 40,000.

According to analysis by Glassnode, the majority of ether transactions are now used to pay for a variety of smart contact commands rather than simple monetary exchanges between so-called externally owned accounts. That, along with a reduction in large-scale “whale” ether accounts, suggests transactions on Ethereum are now more connected to utility than to speculative activity.

The scaling imperative

These are encouraging signals. They reflect growing confidence the initial coin offering (ICO) bust is in the rearview mirror and that concerns about smart contract insecurity are diminishing.

But if the Ethereum community is to achieve its sweeping goal to create a decentralized economic system, it must function at scale. All hinges on Ethereum 2.0.

The two core components of the phased 2.0 transition are incredibly difficult to engineer for a decentralized system of this breadth: a foundational shift from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake blockchain, and an ambitious “sharding” effort to dramatically accelerate transaction processing.

These steps must happen in a phased way.

The development work first entails integrating a new proof-of-stake blockchain known as Beacon, and its related software clients into the legacy proof-of-work blockchain. With no corporate organizational structure to direct commands, all work is conducted by a giant, decentralized, hard-to-coordinate team, with armies of developers in far-flung parts of the globe earning bounties to detect bugs in the system’s sprawling codebase. That’s difficult.

And the importance of getting this right is underscored by Ethereum’s history. On numerous occasions malicious attackers have exploited smart contract loopholes and other security vulnerabilities to steal millions of dollars, most famously in 2016 with the $60 million DAO attack, more recently in the $25 million loss at DeFi protocol dForce.

For all those reasons, Ethereum developers can be excused for the long delays in rolling out 2.0. But they’ll eventually need to flip the switch and start the initial Beacon implementation because, at some point, delays themselves can eat into confidence among participants.

For now, Ethereum 2.0 appears to be enjoying an optimism lift.

Codefi, a financial services platform based at influential Ethereum development lab ConsenSys, this week announced it would pilot a new staking-as-a-service ether product backed by cryptocurrency heavyweights Binance, Huobi Wallet, Matrixport, Crypto.com, DARMA Capital and Trustology. Such services act on behalf of holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies to stake them for block rewards. In effect, it turns cryptocurrency custodial holdings into quasi interest-bearing accounts. Needless to say, the service will only work if and when Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake.

A tiny pond fight

Despite all this progress, the Ethereum economy is still just a tiny dot within the $88 trillion global economy. If it is to change the world, scalability and adoption need to happen.

And because the opportunity is so large compared to its current footprint, there’s no guarantee Ethereum becomes the standard, despite its early lead on other blockchains.

Charles Hoskinson, founder of competing blockchain Cardano, told Ryan Selkis of Messari on Thursday that Ethereum’s claim to have gained unbeatable “network effects” is the “biggest lie ever told in this space.” Ethereum calling itself “the dominant platform” is “like saying you’re the biggest fish in a tiny pond right next to the ocean,” he said.

Charles Hoskinson Source: CoinDesk archives

Hoskinson argues Cardano’s moves in developing countries will let it seize the pole position in a part of the world likely to leapfrog the industrialized world with decentralized technology. But to suggest Ethereum doesn’t have a head start and an advantage is naive. The breadth of developer and transaction activity generates real-world value in a self-fulfilling expansion, as it unlocks funds for Ethereum protocol and dapp developers to do yet more work on new solutions and to bring even more participants into the ecosystem.

Even if it doesn’t win, no one, not even the most hardened bitcoin maximalist, can deny the Ethereum community has fostered some powerful, outside-the-box, innovative ideas for a future economy. It’s these kinds of ideas that will shape the Web 3.0 world to come.

Bitcoin, tech stock

Last week, we, among other outlets, remarked on bitcoin’s closer correlation with U.S. stocks. Both the rally to a four-month high near $10,000 and the subsequent drop last week coincided with similar movements in broad indexes such as the S&P 500. It raised the question: Is bitcoin now solely to be lumped into a broad category of “risk assets?”

But here’s another, more pointed question: Why is bitcoin behaving like an internet network platform? Charlie Morris of ByteTree noted a remarkable correlation between the price of BTC and the NYSE’s FANG+ index. That index’s eight component stocks include six internet juggernauts – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Twitter, Alibaba and Baidu – alongside electric carmaker Tesla and GPU provider Nvidia. Its performance is very much tied to the social network connectivity and data aggregation benefits that the internet has delivered to those dominant platforms. Here’s a chart of bitcoin’s performance against that index.

The relationship has not always been there. As this chart shows, the NYSE FANG+ index and bitcoin were showing essentially zero correlation before March.

Chart showing greater correlation between bitcoin and the FANG Index Source: CoinDesk Research, FactSet

What is this telling us? Well, first, remember the golden rule: Correlation is not causation. But it’s nonetheless tempting to speculate that in the COVID-19 work-from-home era, cryptocurrencies are being viewed as part of a suite of technologies enabling a decentralized, online economy.

The Global Town Hall

NOT JUST CRYPTO. If it’s frustrating for crypto traders to find that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can’t perform on their own terms at the moment, maybe they’ll take some comfort from the fact they are not alone. Foreign exchange traders are also finding currencies behaving as if their value is dependent on stocks. As Eva Szalay at the Financial Times reports, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the British pound, whose fate is normally directly determined by macroeconomic conditions, are now caught in the same “risk-on/risk-off” trading whims of the stock market. It’s yet another way in which the Federal Reserve’s massive monetary stimulus efforts during the COVID-19 crisis are distorting the functioning of our financial system. Like a broken record, let’s say it again: To protect the fabric of our economies and societies, we need a new system for spurring economic activity, one that doesn’t skew it toward the interests of hedge funds and instead encourages innovation and gets resources to those who most need it. Wall Street-centric solutions aren’t working.

DON’T LISTEN TO TINA. The history of financial crises shows the most dangerous assumption in investing is that a particular bet is a sure thing. (Think of the flawed pre-2008 notion that housing prices always go up.) The same goes for the assumption the U.S. dollar will always be propped up by the demand of foreign governments, companies and financial institutions, which need it as a reserve asset or as a trade-intermediating instrument.

Stephen Roach Source: World Economic Forum/Wikimedia

Economist Stephen Roach, formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now a professor at Yale, is taking it upon himself to warn against that assumption. He’s predicting a 35% plunge in the value of the dollar against its trading partners’ currencies, telling CNBC it will “fall very, very sharply.” A move like that would have far-reaching fallout in a global economy where assets and liabilities are heavily dollarized, which is one reason critics of dollar bears like Roach say it won’t happen: because there’s too much at stake. In a supporting column for Bloomberg, Roach called this pro-dollar argument the TINA case – for “there is no alternative” – and he warned of its complacency. With the U.S. now acting against globalization and running dangerously high debt levels, the reasons for foreigners to lose faith in the dollar are rising, he wrote. No mention of the role that cryptocurrencies or stablecoins might play in this, but it’s a reminder the existing framework for the dollar-dominated global economy is ripe for newly imagined form of money.

TRANSPARENCY PLAY. Latin America is proving to be a fairly receptive place for blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions — including among governments. A big part of that stems from the proactive work of the Inter-American Development Bank, which has launched a variety of pilots and experiments in the region. In April, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen reported on a project led by an IDB-sponsored project led by startup Emerge to improve health record keeping amid the COVID-19 crisis. Now, it’s partnering with the World Economic Forum to work with the Colombian government on a blockchain project aimed at adding transparency to official procurement and curtailing corruption. Just a proof-of-concept at this stage, but at a time when other developing nations are facing a crisis of trust in their governments, which undermines faith in their currencies, innovative efforts to boost trust could pay dividends.

That was the overarching conclusion of a virtual Juneteenth event put together by Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain.

While America’s education system has left many ignorant of the origins of Juneteenth, there has been a revived interest in turning the day into a national holiday after protests sprung up around the world in response to the May 25 police killing of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd.

In a wide-ranging conversation Friday, panelists at the event said crypto has the potential to allow citizens to opt out of what they described as a racist financial system on Wall Street. That said, the panelists added, Black people and people of color must be part of the development of the technology for that to happen.

Isaiah Jackson, founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and author of “Bitcoin & Black America,” said he believes Black investment in digital assets would create a more resilient system than Black Wall Street, a Black business district that was burned down by white mobs during the Tulsa race massacre of 1921.

“You can’t burn down cryptocurrency and blockchain technology,” Jackson said. “I want to encourage everyone to stay vigilant and make sure you start to move your money and savings out of this failing system. … We need to make sure we use censorship-resistant and scarce-money systems such as bitcoin.”

Sinclair Skinner, the co-founder of pan-African bitcoin remittance firm BitMari, agreed, saying the ethos of bitcoin and the ethos of the Black community are aligned.

“We say that Satoshi is Black,” Skinner said. “But Satoshi was probably a Black woman because a man would have never been able to walk away and not take credit.”

More work needed

Despite crypto’s potential, however, the industry is not immune to the same societal ills that have affected the broader world, Skinner said.

“Blockchain is full of racists,” he said. “It’s just like the rest of society.”

In the fight for venture capital, blockchain enthusiasts should remember that cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Black founders face the same issues – being turned away for being different, Mesidor said.

In turn, entrepreneurs should choose investors that have diverse funds, said Jalak Jobanputra, founding partner of Future\Perfect Ventures, an early-stage fund investing in blockchain technology and machine learning.

“We have to make sure that diverse voices are represented unlike what happened with the internet 20 years ago when it was really created by one demographic for one demographic,” Jobanputra said.

One source of funding that crypto entrepreneurs could be tapping more is Black family offices, said Genevieve Leveille, CEO of AgriLedger, a U.K.-based blockchain firm trying to ensure pay equity for farmers.

“We are going to a technology which is very nascent and many people do not clearly see yet the opportunities,” she said. “There are plenty of Black family offices and we should be tapping into that network.”

While the industry is still far from making micropayments an everyday thing, the satoshi will be the key piece that helps make that a reality

The satoshi, the smallest amount of Bitcoin, is more than just a unit of measurement.

What’s a Satoshi?

What began as a cypherpunk niche has now become a global phenomenon that’s set to disrupt the financial industry.

However, despite their growing influence, cryptocurrencies, in general, are still far from mainstream.

Bitcoin managed to become more of a household name thanks to its presence in the media and mooning price. However, the general public still lacks an understanding of what makes Bitcoin valuable.

One underrated aspect of Bitcoin is the satoshi, the smallest denomination in BTC.

Named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, the satoshi is BTC’s smallest indivisible unit. It represents one 100 millionth of a Bitcoin.

While it’s by far the most important aspect of Bitcoin, which we’ll address later, it isn’t its only denomination. Bitcoin has a multi-level hierarchical structure—it has 1,000 millibitcoins (mBTC), 1,000,000 microbitcoins (μBTC), and 100,000,000 satoshis (SAT).

Satoshi Nakamoto himself set the existence of satoshis as a unit. By deciding that the value of a single Bitcoin could be divided into 100 million parts, regardless of the price of Bitcoin, it would still be practical to use as a medium of exchange.

However, it wasn’t until 2010 that the then relatively small Bitcoin community began discussing potential names for the coin’s smaller denominations.

It was initially proposed that the one-hundredth of a Bitcoin, or 0.01 BTC, be called a satoshi.

After a few months of deliberation, the term satoshi caught on and was widely adopted by the community instead to mean the one 100 millionth part of a Bitcoin.

In Bitcoin’s early days, when it’s market cap was well below $2 billion, satoshis as a unit of currency received relatively little attention. With Bitcoin’s price still minuscule at the time, few of its holders were concerned with dividing it into such small units.

The Rising Importance of Satoshi

As Bitcoin rose in popularity and expand its influence beyond its small niche, the importance of satoshis increased proportionally.

The conversation around Bitcoin’s real-world utility became more prominent both in and out of the crypto industry. Still, the question of how to facilitate transactions with an abstract, decentralized, and complex coin remained.

Why would people want to invest in a coin that’s been notoriously hard to scale, highly volatile, and only accepted by a relatively small set of merchants around the world?

The answer to this comes down to Bitcoin’s smallest indivisible part—the satoshi.

If the satoshi became a more widespread denomination for Bitcoin, it would bring micropayments closer to a wider array of people. Take a cup of coffee, for example—a $5 takeaway would cost 0.00053 BTC at the time of price. The small amounts and multiple decimal points are challenging to keep track of.

If the same cup of coffee cost instead 53,000 satoshis or sats, it would make it easier to understand.

Many believe that the higher denomination would not only make it easier to comprehend but also easier to spend. Bringing the importance of the satoshi to the fore is also a critical portion of a newcomer’s education. Sam Blackmore, the CEO and founder of Vimba, an auto BTC investing service, told Crypto Briefing:

“While there is clearly a need in the bitcoin community in terms of educating the public about Bitcoin, an industry-wide switch to satoshis as bitcoin’s value measurement may make sense – provided new users are being adequately informed about what the difference between one bitcoin and one satoshi is. At Vimba, we show the value of our users’ bitcoin holdings in mBTC.”

This was the idea behind the mass movement that arose last summer, advocating for the creation of a symbol for the satoshi. The campaign centered around the belief that if the symbol for Bitcoin’s smallest denomination was modeled after the “@” sign, it could change the way people transact and use Bitcoin in general.

Hundreds of people joined the discussion around the design of the sign, much like they did when the design for the Bitcoin logo was first discussed on the BitcoinTalk forum back in 2010.

While the designs varied, almost everyone agreed that just like the “@” sign simplified and sped up internet communication, the satoshi sign would change the way Bitcoin is transferred.

While there is not yet a consensus on the satoshi symbol, the movement generated a lot of press and brought some much-needed attention to the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade, with its price appreciating millions of percent from 2009.

If one BTC was the lowest unit of Bitcoin, then most of the daily goods would today cost in decimals. $100 today is 0.0107 BTC, for example. Our society is not familiar with dealing with the entire currency in decimals.

Bitcoin’s deflationary model not only limits the total number of Bitcoins, which can be mined to 21 million but also ensured that miner rewards are cut periodically to make Bitcoin more scarce.

Even if the entire wealth of the world gets converted in Bitcoin, which is currently $360 trillion, with a fixed supply of 21 million, one Bitcoin will be priced at nearly $17 million. One satoshi at that price would be equivalent to 17 cents.

Today, one satoshi is worth a meager $0.0000928881. It is from this reasoning that the idea of “stacking sats” has gained so much popularity.

This idea follows the premise that cryptocurrencies are still very early. And though it may not seem like much today, any satoshis that users can gather via working for Bitcoin, earning interest, or otherwise is still very valuable. It is also from this idea that dollar-cost averaging (DCA) services by the likes of Coinbase and its competitors have popped up.

DCA services are helpful because they remove much of the emotion that comes with investing in cryptocurrencies. Users can set a recurring time at which point Bitcoin is bought. This could be a small amount every day, bi-weekly, or twice a month. It also offers a steady, cost-efficient entry into the Bitcoin space. Blackmore added:

“Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin enables you to grow your BTC stack over time even if you only have little investable capital available. It alleviates the arduous task of trying to buy the dip every time the price drops and gets you in the habit of stacking sats regularly no matter what. Moreover, if you use an auto-DCA service like Vimba, you can set-it-and-forget-it, and stack sats automatically. So for anyone who believes in the future of bitcoin, dollar-cost averaging simply makes sense.”

Whether it’s adding a convenient symbol or creating easy-to-use onramps to crypto, there is still much work to be done in this field. One mustn’t forget that the technology that would facilitate the micropayments is also still lagging.

However, the satoshi symbol and its growing popularity are incredibly important steps that will help fast-payment channels like Lightning Lab’s Lightning Network and Blockstream’s Liquid turn their ambitious models into an every-day reality.

Banks will be instrumental in bringing about wider cryptocurrency adoption. Without their involvement, the general public will continue to view crypto as a less-than legitimate part of the world of finance.

Admittedly, the vast majority of financial institutions still view bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies with suspicion. That said, some are slowly starting to embrace crypto and blockchain, which in turn is likely to pressure their rivals to follow.

And according to a range of experts, once banks embrace crypto more fully, they’re likely to provide the seamless user experience and easy fiat on/off-ramps that are currently in short supply in crypto.

By providing such services, they could be the key element in paving the way for wider adoption – or even hyperbitcoinization.

Why Bitcoin Need Banks

According to Guardian Circle founder and crypto author Mark Jeffrey, “there are two things missing from crypto.” These are “fiat on and off ramps” and “great user interfaces.”

Jeffrey tells Cryptonews.com,

“The cooperation of someone is required for the fiat on- and off-ramps. Right now, it’s exchanges, which aren't really legacy banks or legacy financial service firms. But the exchanges are too difficult for most people to use.”

Jeffrey concludes that either the crypto sector needs the cooperation of banks or crypto-currency exchanges have to provide a better and more accessible service overall. Jeffrey says,

“We do see them trying – things like Proton and MetalX or Nash Pay are headed this direction.”

Providing an easy way of purchasing cryptocurrencies is perhaps the biggest hurdle to greater adoption. At the moment, however, many banks – particularly in nations such as the UK and the US – actively prevent their customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit and sometimes even debit cards.

“Crypto purists find themselves in a tricky position,” says Glen Goodman, the author of The Crypto Trader.

He explains,

“They would love to see cryptocurrencies destroy the traditional banking system, ushering in a decentralized financial utopia. But, unfortunately, they need the cooperation of banks to drive crypto adoption, as most people only buy crypto if their bank or credit card provider allows them to transfer money to a crypto exchange.”

Arguably, having banks put up various barriers to buying crypto is a significant block on wider cryptocurrency adoption.

By prohibiting credit card purchases, or by slowing up transfers to or from exchanges, they send customers the message that crypto isn’t for the mainstream.

Slow But Steady Movement

For some within the crypto industry, this shouldn’t necessarily be a problem.

According to Scott Melker, a crypto trader at TexasWestCapital, bitcoin and other decentralized private cryptocurrencies were designed to circumvent the banking system anyway.

Asked whether cooperation from banks is necessary for bitcoin’s wider adoption, he tells Cryptonews.com,

“Absolutely not. Bitcoin’s greatest value proposition is a hedge against bad actors, namely central banks. Cryptocurrencies bank the unbanked.”

At the same time, Melker is reluctant to generalize as to whether banks worldwide are receptive to crypto, and perhaps even to investing in crypto themselves.

He says,

“Banks operate in various jurisdictions and countries, at different levels from national to local and with completely different rules. I would generally say that the legacy banking system is extremely far from accepting bitcoin in general. Those that are open to it are few and far between for now.”

That said, there has been a slight yet noticeable uptick in banks willing to enter the crypto arena in recent months.

Jeffrey says,

“Most banks still regard crypto companies with suspicion. But JPMorgan, despite Jamie Dimon’s anti-crypto comments of the past few years, has been increasingly crypto-friendly.”

In May, JPMorgan opened accounts for two of America’s biggest crypto-exchanges, Coinbase and Gemini. Jeffrey believes this could open the gates for big banks to follow, and for the banking industry to become more cooperative for crypto traders.

“I think we will see banks move slowly until one of them suddenly leaps ahead of the other with bitcoin and crypto products – probably JPMorgan or Fidelity – and the rest will scramble to follow. And then it will happen very fast,” he opines.

Glen Goodman largely agrees, noting that major high street banks “have been given a kick up the ass by newer fintech banks like the UK-based Revolut, who offer crypto-investing as a service to their account holders.”

According to Goodman, fintech firms and challenger banks may be key to driving the banking industry towards crypto.

“Fintechs are often more relaxed about working with the crypto industry, and threaten to usurp the lumbering traditional banks by experimenting with new business models,” he adds. “Traditional banks are well-aware of this threat.”

What’s Next?

Aside from the few banks and fintech firms that are moving towards crypto, what would it take for the banking sector as a whole to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

“Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a gold-like store of value,” says Jeffrey, who also notes that current world events “have compressed that proving from years into months.”

In addition, Jeffrey thinks that banks will embrace bitcoin once they learn how to make money from it, in the same way that they make money from fiat by issuing loans and credit.

Once they’ve reassured themselves that they can profit from BTC, they will dive in. Then, wider adoption will follow, perhaps even to the point where bitcoin becomes a major global currency.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/akon-city-akoin-cryptocurrency/,"Akon City: $6 Billion Cryptocurrency City Set to Begin Construction

Akon City, a “futuristic cryptocurrency themed city” founded by famous singer Akon, is ready to begin construction, with a plan to use the akoin cryptocurrency exclusively. Phase one of Akon City’s construction will include roads, a hospital, a mall, hotels, and a school. There will also be parks, universities, a stadium, and an industrial complex.

Akon City Unveils Construction Plans

The $6 billion city in Senegal billed a “futuristic cryptocurrency themed city,” founded by Senegalese-American star and philanthropist Akon, has awarded its building contract to KE International, a U.S.-based engineering firm. Akon City announced earlier this month:

Akon City’s phase 1 is expected to complete by end of 2023, and will see the construction of roads, a Hamptons Hospital campus, a Hamptons Mall, residences, hotels, a police station, a school, a waste facility and a solar power plant.

Akon, whose full name is Aliaume Damala Badara Akon Thiam, is a famous singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. He has sold over 35 million albums worldwide and received 5 Grammy nominations for The Sweet Escape, Bartender, Konvicted, I Wanna Love You, and Smack That.

“Akoin is a cryptocurrency powered by a marketplace of tools and services fueling the dreams of entrepreneurs, business owners, and social activists as they connect and engage across the rising economies of Africa and beyond,” the project’s website details. According to Thursday’s announcement:

Akon City phase 2 will run from 2024 to 2029 and will end with a complete cryptocurrency city running exclusively on akoin cryptocurrency.

For Akon City’s first and second phases of building, KE International has secured $4 billion from investors. Dubai based Bakri & Associates Development Consultants will lead the architectural designs of Akon City under KE International’s guidance.

About Akon City and Akoin Crypto

Akon City will be located near Mbodième, a small coastal village in the west of Senegal, West Africa, less than an hour’s drive south of the new Blaise Diagne International airport in Dakar. Aimed to be a tourist city with a cryptocurrency-based economy, Akon City plans to have parks, universities, schools, a stadium, hotels, and an industrial complex fully completed by 2030. Akon first announced his plan to build Akon City in 2018, stating at the time that he was working with the Senegalese government on the project.

The city plans to exclusively use the akoin cryptocurrency, which is built on the Stellar payment network. The akoin cryptocurrency is also to be used in Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC), a green city based in Western Kenya, which KE International is also building. Commenced in 2014, the construction project is 85% done and expected to complete in December this year. Recently, it partnered with the Akoin platform for its blockchain-based digital transactions. Akon hopes his akoin crypto will be used all over Africa where a significant portion of the population remains unbanked but smartphones are widely used.

‘Elon Musk’ bitcoin giveaways continue to scam people on Youtube. Scammers have reportedly pulled in millions of dollars in bitcoin from people wanting to double their cryptocurrency. Some of them use bitcoin addresses containing the name Elon Musk, Spacex, or Tesla. Before sending money to a bitcoin address, check if it has been reported as an address used by scammers.

Elon Musk Bitcoin Giveaway Scam

The number of bitcoin scams using the name Elon Musk, Spacex, or Tesla has been growing. Videos promoting a scam claiming that Elon Musk is giving away 5,000 BTC or 10,000 BTC have been appearing regularly on Youtube. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on this scam which asks people to send them bitcoin, promising to return twice as much BTC sent immediately. The scam pulled people in with an interview with Elon Musk and the recent Spacex launch.

The CEO of cyber-security firm Adaptiv, Justin Lister, has been tracking bitcoin sent to vanity addresses containing names such as Elon Musk, Telsa, or Spacex to promote BTC giveaway scams over the past month, Zdnet reported on Friday. Examples of such addresses are “1Musk…” or “1Elonmusk…”

He tracked down 66 addresses that have been reported to Bitcoinabuse.com, a public database of bitcoin addresses used by hackers and criminals. Using his research and data from the Bitcoin Abuse website, the news outlet found that a total of 214 BTC have been sent to the Elon Musk vanity addresses, which is more than $2 million at the current exchange rate. Since scammers do not just use vanity addresses, such as the one shown in the image above, the total amount they have raked in from this type of scam could be significantly more than $2 million.

Elon Musk is not the only celebrity being used to promote fake bitcoin giveaways. Others that have been used to promote BTC scams include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, FUBU CEO Daymond John, and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki.

It is generally unwise to send bitcoin to anyone claiming to double your BTC. If you come across a bitcoin scam address, you can report it to Bitcoinabuse.com. The site also lets you check whether a particular address has been reported as an address used by scammers, check report history, and monitor stolen bitcoin.

At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin Abuse website shows that there have been 115 reports in the last day, 680 reports in the last week, and 4,636 reports in the last month.

There is also a new website called Scam Alert, launched on Friday by popular blockchain monitor Whale Alert. You can use the site check if a certain bitcoin address has been reported as a scam address. The Scam Alert website explains: “Our goal is to make blockchain safer for everyone by tracking and exposing criminals who abuse blockchain for illegal activities.”

Key Takeaways An increase in the gas limit could benefit DeFi users as gas prices will ease off.

The cost of running a node will increase, causing fewer users to run full nodes.

Changes to the gas limit are unilaterally decided by miners – the community has no say in the matter.

Share this article

Ethereum miners are voting to increase the network’s gas limit from 10 million to 12.5 million per block. The move could lower transaction fees on the network, but it also has undue consequences.

Demand for Ethereum Blockspace

The decision to increase the gas limit is a positive implication for DeFi, which has recently suffered from bloated gas prices.

While DeFi activity and token prices are booming, users have been paying exorbitant fees for over two months now.

The #Ethereum miners are voting to increase the Block Gas Limit from 10,000,000 to 12,500,000. ⛏️ In theory, this means that the Ethereum network now has the capabilities to handle ~44 transactions per second, instead of ~35. Another huge milestone for the community.🥳🎉 — Bitfly (@etherchain_org) June 19, 2020

Ethereum’s dApps are not at fault here because interacting with smart contracts requires several orders of magnitude more gas than, say, sending ETH from one address to another.

Every blockchain network has to balance the trade-offs between throughput and growing database size.

A blockchain that can process 15,000 transactions per second will be able to cater to a variety of users but makes life difficult for those running full nodes. This is because the size of the blockchain expands at a much faster rate.

The decision to increase Ethereum’s gas limit by 25% has its own set of repercussions. Péter Szilágyi, who leads the Go Ethereum team, doesn’t think this a good idea.

In a public tweet, Szilágyi said this move imperils the long term health of the network and increases the scope of DOS attacks.

Bitcoin maximalists often harp on the growing size of the Ethereum blockchain as a primary criticism. This is a fair argument because any public blockchain needs a variety of vigilant full node operators to ensure the network is functioning correctly.

Are Ethereum Miners Misaligned?

Miners unilaterally decide Ethereum’s the gas limit. An increase or decrease is subject to a hash-power weighted vote.

It is odd, however, that the users who benefit from a higher gas limit are in charge of setting that limit.

This decision should ideally be put in the hands of the community. People can discuss the pros and cons of such a move relative to prevailing circumstances.

But the Ethereum community has no say in the matter. Miners alone can change the gas limit, causing further burden to node operators.

Historically, Ethereum miners haven’t strayed too far from community consensus when it comes to the gas limit. Nevertheless, a solution that directs power away from miners, and towards users or node operators would result in more neutral outcomes.

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has revised its cryptocurrency project rankings. Thirty-seven crypto projects were evaluated overall and in three sub-categories. Bitcoin has risen while the top three spots remained occupied by EOS, Tron, and Ethereum.

CCID’s 18th Ranking Released

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, published its 18th update of crypto project rankings on Thursday. The last update was in April when the review was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This month, the same 37 crypto projects were ranked overall as well as in three sub-categories: basic technology, applicability, and creativity.

In the 18th ranking, BTC improved slightly from the April revision overall, rising from the 14th position to the 12th position. BCH fell slightly from the 31st position to the 34th spot. Meanwhile, EOS, Tron, and ETH continue to top the overall ranking.

The CCID explained in its Thursday announcement that its evaluation methodology has not changed from the previous period. The basic technology subindex accounts for 65% of the total score. The innovation subindex accounts for 20% of the total, whereas the creativity subindex accounts for 15%.

The rankings are compiled every two months by the CCID (Qingdao) Blockchain Research Institute, an entity established by the CCID. Several organizations participate in the evaluation work, including the CCID think tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. The center previously said that “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers.”

According to blockchain data firm Longhash, there are currently 83,199 registered blockchain companies in China, 29,053 of which are still in operation while 59,339 companies have had their legal status or license revoked. As for cryptocurrencies, several Chinese courts have ruled that bitcoin and ethereum are legal property, protected by Chinese law. In May, China’s top legislature passed the civil code that protects crypto inheritance.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) has announced its largest cryptocurrency investment funding of startups. Eight companies in seven countries will use Unicef’s crypto fund to develop prototypes, pilot, or scale their technologies. Several of them are working on mitigating the hardships resulting from the covid-19 pandemic.

Unicef Announces Largest Crypto Investment

Unicef Cryptocurrency Fund announced on Friday its largest investment of startups in developing and emerging economies. Companies receiving crypto funding include those that will use their technologies towards mitigating the hardships of covid-19. Unicef is a U.N. agency responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide. The announcement reads:

Eight technology companies in developing and emerging economies will receive investment from the Unicef Cryptocurrency Fund (Cryptofund) to solve local and global challenges.

The Unicef crypto fund will invest 125 ETH in the eight companies from seven countries “to develop prototypes, pilot, or scale their technologies over six months,” the announcement details. “All investees have previously received up to $100,000 from Unicef’s Innovation Fund and are now receiving cryptocurrency to continue the development of their open-source and digital public goods.”

“We are seeing the digital world come at us more quickly than we could have imagined – and Unicef must be able to use all of the tools of this new world to help children today and tomorrow,” says Chris Fabian of Unicef Ventures. “The transfer of these funds – to eight companies in seven countries around the world – took less than 20 minutes and cost us less than $20. Almost instant global movement of value, fees of less than 0.00009% of the total amount transferred, and real-time transparency for our donors and supporters are the types of tools we are excited about.”

Recipients of Unicef’s Crypto Funding

Among the eight companies receiving crypto from the Unicef Cryptocurrency Fund, three are grantees that received the fund’s first cryptocurrency investment last year. The rest were chosen from almost 40 startups that have graduated from the Unicef Innovation Fund. These companies “have undergone technical evaluations, quality assessments of their open-source tech solutions, evidence of impact and more,” Unicef described.

Two of the recipients of Unicef’s crypto are Indian companies: Avyantra and Statwig. Other recipients are Afinidata (Guatemala), Cireha (Argentina), Ideasis (Turkey), OS City (Mexico), Somleng (Cambodia), and Utopic (Chile).

Besides funding, these companies will “receive business growth mentorship, product, and technical assistance, open-source and UX and UI development, access to experts and partners, as well as opportunities to showcase their solutions,” the Unicef announcement further notes.

Unicef launched its cryptocurrency fund in October 2019 and became the first U.N. organization to hold and make transactions in cryptocurrency. The crypto fund makes disbursements denominated in bitcoin and ether to finance early stage, open-source technology benefiting children and young people. In addition, the Unicef Innovation Fund and Cryptofund currently have an open call for blockchain solutions to apply for funding of up to $100,000 and cryptocurrency combined.

Decrypted, a new crypto movie about Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, is in production. In this “outrageous and provocative dark comedy,” Satoshi Nakamoto is kidnapped by the NSA and tortured for information that could help the government destroy cryptocurrency.

Satoshi Nakamoto in New Crypto Movie

A new movie about cryptocurrency and Bitcoin’s creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is in production. Categorized as a comedy on IMDB, the movie “Decrypted” is written by Mick Sands and directed by Tom Sands. The movie’s description on IMDB reads:

An outrageous and provocative dark comedy about a mismatched NSA team who kidnap the creator of Bitcoin ⁠— Satoshi Nakamoto ⁠— and attempt to torture him for the information they need to destroy crypto-currencies.

The role of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is portrayed by Akie Kotabe, who played a leading role opposite Oscar-nominated actress Salma Hayek in the 2014 action thriller Everly. Decrypted also stars Sophia Myles from Transformers: Age of Extinction, David Hoflin from Z: The Beginning of Everything, Emilia Fox from Silent Witness, Don Gilet from The Stranger, and Kevin McNally from Pirates of the Caribbean.

The movie is being produced by Substantial Films, a small independent film company based in the U.K. Twenty-one titles are listed under this company on IMDB. Substantial Films’ website states: “We are currently in production on a new film called Decrypted, a dark comedy set in the world of the intelligence agencies.” However, the production of the film is delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Substantial Films notes on its website, “Unfortunately, we were forced to suspend the production of Decrypted at the end of March due to covid-19,” elaborating:​

We have about 70% of the film in the can, and we’re very happy with everything we’ve got.

“As soon as is practical, we will resume shooting of the remaining scenes … Meanwhile, we’re going to start editing what we’ve got, so the film will be moving forward even though the production has temporarily stalled,” the film company clarified.

In an interview with Cointelegraph (CT), Decrypted producer Phil Harris said: “we’re editing away. I think as a film producer and a keen crypto fan, I wanted to explore the emerging crypto space within the industry as a whole.” Pointing out that the movie is not just about Satoshi Nakamoto, he affirmed that a lot of research went into the film to ensure that Bitcoin-related elements look authentic. The publication adds that actress Talisa Garcia plays Sofia Perez, Satoshi Nakamoto’s love interest and his accomplice in the movie.

The movie’s screenwriter, Mick Sands, is also a crypto enthusiast, Harris continued, adding that the fact that the mere existence of Bitcoin is a threat to the U.S. government is fascinating to him. “Mick, our writer, he’s a bit of a rebel, he has always been fascinated with the crypto world and already wanted to write a film involving it in some way,” Harris was quoted by CT as saying. “Especially how the American security services see it as a major threat to their stranglehold over the world economy and how they’re trying to desperately dismantle it or regulate it.”

Harris further told the publication that the movie is also funded using cryptocurrency. According to him, the film will be initially released through crypto native video platforms. “We wanted this film to be part of the crypto revolution within the film industry. So we will be releasing it to some crypto video-on-demand platforms,” he revealed, noting that some examples are Livetree, Breaker, Movieschain, and Cinezen. However, the filmmaker aims to eventually sell the film’s rights to a major platform such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, Harris said, adding that he expects the film to be released by the end of 2020.

Another crypto movie is in the works. Deadline reported earlier this month that the Winklevoss twins will help produce a feature film adaptation of Bitcoin Billionaires, the bestselling non-fiction book by Ben Mezrich.

You may be surprised by how active Eastern European countries are in the cryptocurrency space. According to Statista research, Poland, Latvia, Georgia, Estonia, and Lithuania, all ranked among the top 15 countries by the total value of alternative finance market transactions in Europe in 2018. In the same year, per capita funding for alternative online finance transactions was highest in the UK, but followed by Latvia and Estonia.

This is not the only evidence that Eastern Europe is exploring financial paradigms outside of traditional channels like central banking. One might be surprised to learn that Georgia is the world’s second-largest mining country after China, Moldova has legalized cryptocurrency mining, and Belarus is predicted to become the European Hong Kong?

This article is brought to you by Solomon Brown, Head of PR at Freewallet, to give you an idea of which countries favor Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and which ones strictly forbid them. Get the full picture of the suddenly-hot crypto ecosystem of Eastern Europe.

Cryptocurrency Regulation in Eastern Europe

Most countries in Eastern Europe are split on cryptocurrency: either pro or con. Here’s a chart displaying where crypto and mining are legal (+), not legal (-) or unregulated (0).

Country Cryptocurrency Mining The Republic of Belarus + +

Georgia 0 + Czech Republic 0 0 Russia – – Bulgaria 0 0 Hungary 0 0 Slovakia 0 0 Poland + + Moldova – 0 Ukraine – 0

+ The Republic of Belarus and Cryptocurrency

Let’s start with the fact that Belarus has its own Silicon Valley that operates on the principle of extraterritoriality. Hi-Tech Park (HTP) is a Belarusian tax and legal zone, facilitating IT evolution, and home to 450 companies working in software development.

In 2017, the cryptocurrency activities of the residents of the HTP received full comprehensive legislative support from the government. The administration of the HTP, together with the National Bank, the Department of Financial Monitoring of the State Control Committee, international experts, and other bodies, compiled and signed all the necessary documents.

For instance, Decree No. 8 “on the development of the digital economy” legalized crypto exchanges and cryptocurrency exchange operators, mining, smart contracts, blockchain, tokens, etc.

From the moment the Decree was adopted, any transactions with tokens (mining, storing crypto, purchase, exchange) became exempt from income tax and VAT until January 1, 2023. The rules regulating the operations of companies involved in the cryptosphere have been accepted by the HTP, and the full legal regulation of cryptocurrencies in Belarus has been established. It is worth noting that only entities that are registered as residents of the Hi-Tech Park are allowed to carry out activities related to cryptocurrencies. If you are interested in this topic here is another article about Common cryptocurrency cyber-attack vectors which you might find interesting.

– Georgia’s Powerful Mining Pools

In 2019 UN statistical publications, Georgia is assigned to Western Asia, not to Eastern Europe. But, geographically it belongs to Eastern Europe and is a member of the Council of Europe. We’ve decided to include it not because of favorable crypto legislation, but due to its triumphs in mining.

A document from the Ministry of Finance notes that each unit of a crypto-asset has a market value, it can be issued, it can have an owner, its property rights can be transferred to another and divided into parts and it can be bought and sold. At the same time, the note states that, in accordance with the legislation of Georgia, a crypto asset is not a legal means of payment or electronic money.

Nevertheless, the country is experiencing a hydro-powered Bitcoin boom. According to BBC, the fact that cryptocurrency mining is “sucking its power grid dry,” doesn’t matter because of Georgia’s vast reserves of renewable hydroelectric power. Probably this reason and lack of regulations have encouraged home miners and attracted foreign businesses. According to NPR, most of the Georgian mining facilities belong to the American company Bitfury.

And although the legislation of Georgia does not regulate activities related to virtual currency, and cryptocurrency in the country does not constitute a legal means of payment, transactions of virtual money between individuals are nevertheless made. However, the government of Georgia has taken the first step towards regulating the crypto business. The multiple mining pools that will use the services of intermediary companies registered in Georgia will be subject to a value-added tax of 18%.

+ Czech Republic Pioneers Bitcoin Regulations

The Czech Republic was one of the first European countries open to operations with Bitcoin, even before the cryptocurrency market boom of 2017. In April 2015, the Czech National Bank issued a document that clarified the attitude of the state towards cryptocurrencies called, “Safety of online payments and virtual currency from the Czech National Bank point of view.” According to this document, operations with cryptocurrencies were not limited by the law of the country, only the norms of EU law applied to them.

Later on, in 2017, the Czech Republic decided to comply with the EU’s requirements for anti-money laundering and introduced the amendments to the Act on Selected Measures against Legitimization of Proceeds of Crime and Financing of Terrorism. According to the new law, all exchanges, including banks, have to verify client ID for crypto to fiat transactions amounting to €1000 and more.

– Russia and Cryptocurrency

On March 16, 2020, local news outlet Vesti.ru announced that cryptocurrency production and circulation would be banned in Russia. The issuance and circulation of cryptocurrency in Russia carries an unjustified risk, according to the bill on “Digital Financial Assets”.

The bill levied a ban on the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrency in Russia, and established penalties for violations of the ban. Nevertheless, the authorities don’t intend to ban ownership of digital currencies.

+ Bulgaria’s Prized Stash of Nearly $2B Bitcoin

The Bulgarian government sees cryptocurrencies as a financial asset (and owns 213,519 BTC confiscated from criminals, which is more than Bulgaria’s GDP). This state has neither recognized the legitimacy of Bitcoin nor declared it to be illegal. The main condition for the use of cryptocurrency in Bulgaria is the payment of a tax in the amount of 10% of the exchange or sale.

– Hungary and Cryptocurrency Taxes

Cryptocurrencies are not considered a legal means of payment in the country. According to the local news outlet Portfolio (restricted access), the government has created a special group of Hungary’s central bank, the Finance Ministry, and the tax authority that is studying the industry to develop a legal framework. All cryptocurrency transactions are filed under “other income” and taxed under Hungarian capital gains tax code, which contains 15% capital gains tax and 19.5% health contribution which is called as (EHO).

+ Slovakia Monitors Cryptocurrency Transactions

Slovakia is on the list of countries that have officially recognized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, in 2018, the authorities tightened their stance on digital business. Following the initiative of a national regulator — the Slovak National Bank — all banks began to close the accounts of firms associated with cryptocurrencies. A similar hostile reaction from the existing financial system to digital currencies was observed in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.

In spite of the restrictive measures, non-fiat currencies are not regulated in Slovak law in any way, and their exchange, mining, and other operations are not outside the legal framework. Like the rest of the European Union, Slovakia recognizes that cryptocurrency transactions should be monitored and taxed.

+ Poland Forward Thinking Finance

The Republic of Poland ranks 36th in the world in terms of population. It stands to reason that such a large European country is forward-thinking when it comes to finance. The attitude of local financial regulators towards investing in cryptocurrencies is quite positive. The country’s Central Statistical Office (GUS) has recognized the trading and mining of virtual currencies as an official economic activity. In a statement from 2016, the ministry stated that despite virtual currencies not being subject to any separate regulations under Polish legislation, they are fully legal and subject to income tax.

Along with that, the government supports blockchain startups. For example, in January 2019, the financial and budgetary supervision service of Poland (KNF) granted state licenses to blockchain startups Coinquista and Bitclude.

+ Ukraine’s Approach to Digital Money

The Verkhovna Rada has registered a bill proposing to legalize cryptocurrency. Plans for this were announced back in 2017, but then authorities did not dare to take such a step. And now “digital money” can be recognized as legal assets. The document titled “On Amending the Tax Code and other laws of Ukraine regarding the taxation of operations with crypto assets” was developed by representatives of the blockchain community, inter-faction elected representatives, the Office of Effective Regulation of BRDO and the Ministry of Digital Transformation.

Along with that, recent introductions to the legislative structure haven’t been that positive. The law “On Amending Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Institutional Mechanism for the Prevention of Corruption” No. 140-IX, which entered into force on October 18, 2019, made amendments to the law “On Prevention of Corruption” and establishes the need to declare cryptocurrency as an intangible asset.

– Moldova’s Legal Mining

Cryptocurrency transactions are not legalized in the country, however, according to local media reports, digital money is popular in Moldova. In the center of Chisinau, there are several points that accept digital money as a means of payment.

In May 2018, the Association of Digital and Distributed Technologies of the country introduced its own cryptocurrency exchange that accepts fiat like Moldovan Leu, the Russian ruble, the US dollar, and the Euro, as well as all top ten cryptocurrencies. Even though the National Bank of Moldova hasn’t officially permitted making transactions with crypto, it sent a letter to Drachmae Market, the first local crypto exchange in Moldova, which indirectly allows it to do banking.

Moreover, in 2018, this small country hosted its first conference on blockchain and cryptocurrencies called the World Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Summit Chisinau – WBCSummit. Reporting on the conference, Crуptovest noted that “the central bank recognized the potential of blockchain for the financial system and revealed that it was assessing the implementation of technology via local banks.” Cryptocurrency legislation might be on the horizon in Moldova, as mining is already legal here.

Cryptocurrency Mining in Eastern Europe

The Transdniestrian Moldavian Republic (DMR) adopted a law on the development of information blockchain technologies, which technically makes cryptocurrency mining legal. According to the president of DMR, the law will contribute to the development of the information technology industry and attract investment from entities operating in the field of blockchain technologies. DMR may become a paradise for miners.

The law provides for the creation of a targeted free-trade zone, where foreign companies and individuals can become legal entities without additional bureaucratic procedures. Thus, the country is becoming a relatively attractive region for investment. Local authorities have guaranteed the duty-free import and export of mining equipment for residents and special electricity tariffs for miners. The president promised that the energy supply to mining farms will be provided by the Dubossary hydroelectric station and three thermal power plants.

Who would have thought that such a small country like Georgia could become a world leader in the field of cryptocurrency mining? A study by the Cambridge Alternative Finance Center (CCAF), which was published in 2018, indicated that Georgia ranks second in the world in terms of mining volume after China. At least 60 MW of electricity was officially spent on the mining of virtual currency in the country.

The first, and perhaps most important, thing that attracts mining lovers to Georgia is cheap electricity. And there is plenty of it since, after the collapse of the USSR, small Georgia inherited 20 hydroelectric power stations from the defunct Soviet state. The country was meant to become a kind of energy hub in the Caucasus. Obviously, such a large amount of electricity for a country with a population of 3.7 million people is a lot. As a result, the cost of electricity in Georgia is among the lowest in the world.

So, as of May 2019, the price of 1 kW in Tbilisi was approximately 6 cents. But, there are still mountainous areas where electricity is cheaper or even free of charge (due to state subsidies), and free industrial zones (where the cost of electricity is 18% lower due to the absence of VAT).

Belarus is another strong Eastern-European player in the field of mining. As you already know, a crypto-friendly economic policy and the creation of its own Silicon Valley is a part of the country’s strategy of becoming a global IT center. Though mining has lost ground after Bitcoin halving, Belarus is ready to invest its fairly cheap energy to gain profit from BTC mining.

In 2019, during a meeting with representatives of the IT sector in Hi-Tech Park, Alexander Lukashenko said that he was going to employ a new Belarusian nuclear power plant, to mine Bitcoins. The president explained he wanted to use the surpluses of electric power to ensure the operation of mining farms. “I even especially left a place there! Let’s build farms and mine this Bitcoin (…) If there is Bitcoin, you can always sell it” – Lukashenko commented.

Cryptocurrencies in Eastern Europe: Where to Buy and How to Spend

To buy cryptocurrencies, a lot of countries in the so-called “second world” use one of the largest crypto exchanges, Exmo. This trading platform supports 183 trading pairs with many leading cryptocurrencies and local fiat currencies like the euro, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Polish zloty. The website is available in Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, and other languages. Users can buy crypto with a credit card, SEPA transfer, Yandex Money, Qiwi, and Payeer.

Non-EU former Soviet countries, like Russia and Ukraine, use Bestchange.ru. The service provides structured information about automatic and manual exchangers of crypto and electronic currencies, and also supports the ruble and hryvnia.

Eastern European countries are home to many of Freewallet’s regular customers with Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Belarus, and Moldova making up about 10% of our user base. From our family of simple and secure wallets, these countries most often go for Freewallet: Crypto Wallet, which supports BTC, ETH and 100+ other cryptocurrencies, and our Bitcoin Wallet. Freewallet apps are highly rated for their built-in exchange and fee-free transactions within the ecosystem.

In Georgia, the first ATM that allows you to exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency appeared in March 2018 at the New York Burger diner. A few months later, a second one was installed in Tbilisi. As of November 2019, there are 14 cryptomats operating in the country.

Poland is one of the largest countries in Europe that welcomes the development of blockchain technology. In 2018, the first Bitcoin ATMs with BTC, LTC, and ETH appeared in Gdansk and Bialystok.

The largest Polish food delivery service Pyszne.pl began to accept cryptocurrencies in 2017. This innovation took place after the purchase of the service by Dutch investors. Currently, Pyszne.pl serves more than 8 thousand catering establishments. The average number of customers is 955 thousand and 7% of users pay in crypto.

The Czech Republic might be small, nevertheless, it ranks sixth in the world in the number of crypto ATM machines. Globally, there are almost five thousand ATMs, and in the Czech Republic, there are about 70. Most of them are set in Prague. Bitcoin ATMs can be found not only in large shopping centers and electronics stores but also in kiosks at metro stations, along with printed materials, cigarettes, and tickets.

The number of Czech companies and organizations that accept Bitcoins as payment is increasing, and not all of them are related to the IT field. On the list, you can find the largest electronics store Alza.cz, a coffee shop in Paralelni Polis (in addition to BTC, they also accept Litecoin, Dash and Monero) and the Paper Hub coworking agency related to the same project.

A real estate agency Home Hunters has been in the public eye since it closed on a 35-Bitcoin-deal, which at that time exceeded 5 million korunas. Also, there are places like Krypto, a local gas station, FairPlayAuto, a second-hand car marketplace, and a number of hotels and restaurants.

There is a large list of exciting blockchain and crypto projects out of Eastern Europe. We will start with the fintech startup with Russian roots Zerion. The company deals with investing and managing decentralized assets. It was founded in 2016 by graduates of the Higher School of Economics and has 15 thousand users. At the end of 2019, the startup raised $2 million during the seeding round with the American venture fund Placeholder, with Blockchain Ventures among the investors. Recently Zerion acquired the crypto platform MyDeFi that facilitates viewing crypto portfolios.

No wonder Belarus is on the list of the top 10 European countries for launching a blockchain startup. One of the local projects you might have heard of is Rocket DAO, a decentralized crowdfunding platform with independent expert evaluations of startups. These venture capitalist market analysts work with Hi-Tech Park, Angels Band, Volat Capital, Belagroprombank, friendly accelerators and foreign funds to allow startup founders to quickly and safely attract financing. The company provides startup audits, mentoring programs, and unique assessments. Their Startup Training Camp graduates get a free Startup Pack that usually costs over $7,000.

Czech Republic takes 27th place in the Global Innovation Index. The country is the cradle of innovative projects like Apiary whose parent organization is Oracle Corporation. Founded in 2014, it specializes in providing frameworks and tools for creating application programming interfaces (APIs), including the Blockchain APIs that allow you to send and receive Bitcoin, as well as convenient ways to design modern cloud applications. The startup attracted $6.8 million in investments in a Series A in San Francisco in 2015.

Have you ever thought of farm-to-table food traceability? TE-Food, a Hungarian food supply chain solution, offers this service on a blockchain. With food industry experts and Animal Welfare and Husbandry advisors in their management and FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organization) and Deloitte among their partners, the company takes care of the logistics and makes livestock and fresh food supply information transparent.

Sofia, Bulgaria hosts the headquarters of Open Source University that is trying to change the world of education through distributed technologies. The project connects educational institutions, students and businesses directly by eliminating the middlemen. It helps organizations get insights on candidates’ personalities. Learners can enroll in, and track the completion of tailored educational and professional development experiences. The company behind Rechained Ltd. decided to solve the problem of trust beyond institutional and national borders in the authenticity of formal diplomas and certificates after writing a book called Blockchain in Education.

The Prospects of Cryptocurrency in Eastern Europe

Cryptocurrency in Eastern Europe is set to become a facet of everyday life. As people that have experienced financial instability and changing political regimes (often swings from Communism to Democracy), the residents of Eastern Europe are mentally more prepared for cryptocurrencies than Westerners.

The West is characterized by a higher standard of living and better banking services, as well as a higher average age of the population. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, is full of active young entrepreneurs who are engaged in small business and therefore are especially interested in lightning-fast financial transactions of better quality and without intermediaries.

Many governments want to tap into the benefits of blockchain. Georgia and Belarus, for instance, are taking full advantage of the economic perks of mining. Hopefully, that new laws and amendments will not impede the development of the crypto industry in Eastern Europe, but rather will lead to this region becoming a world blockchain hub.",2020-06-21 17:13:07-07:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-good-year-narrative,"One of the things I most enjoy about working in the crypto sector (apart from my awesome colleagues and the constant flow of fascinating change) is the level of debate.

I’m not being sarcastic. There are many takes I strongly disagree with, but when they are put forward by people with rational and inquisitive minds (which can be most of the time, depending on your Twitter filters), the engagement invariably ends up enriching my own opinion. And, sometimes, bouncing someone else’s conviction off yours opens your eyes to nuances you hadn’t seen. Who knows? Entertaining conflicting points might actually change minds.

Now, when you take two intelligent opinions that you don’t agree with, throw them together with yours and stir them up a bit, magic can do its uncomfortable thing. That happened to me this week.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

Many of you will already have seen Bloomberg commentator Joe Weisenthal’s list of six reasons why bitcoin has not had a great year. To recap, they were a lack of new highs, its new correlation with the S&P 500, disappointingly resilient fiat currencies and inflation levels, and a new competitor for the volatility trade in the form of stocks.

Of course, there were many reactions. One of the best responses I’ve seen was from Nathaniel Whittemore, who stressed the progress made in institutional uptake, growth in emerging market demand and bitcoin’s endurance. Another was from Messari’s Ryan Selkis, who objected to Joe’s interpretation of bitcoin narratives and timeframes. I expand on some of my objections further down.

A different angle

The other analysis I disagreed with this week was from JPMorgan, although their take was almost the opposite of Joe’s.

A report shared with the investment bank’s clients and seen by CoinDesk boldly stated bitcoin has had a good year so far, highlighting that, even through the market turmoil in March, the cryptocurrency only briefly dipped below its cost of production. It also points out that liquidity in bitcoin markets was more resilient than in other more traditional markets. The analysis concludes that this points to a long and happy life for bitcoin, but more as a vehicle of speculation than as a store of value.

So, here we have Joe hinting bitcoin has had a disappointing first half because it didn’t have spectacular price moves relative to other asset groups, and JPMorgan inferring it’s had an unexpectedly good first half for the same reason.

In my opinion, they are both missing the point. But my disagreement with them changed my mind about something.

Common factors

Both JPMorgan and Joe seem to assume there is a clear narrative around bitcoin’s value.

JPMorgan equates bitcoin’s intrinsic value with its mining costs, although this is difficult to reliably calculate and reflects only a small part of the ecosystem. What’s more, mining costs could come down in line with lower energy prices, which does not mean bitcoin’s intrinsic value will come down if we rely on the “what an asset is worth” definition of the term. The analysts also infer that bitcoin’s current correlation with the S&P 500 represents the breakdown of its store of value potential, which overlooks the nature of backward-looking short-term calculations.

Joe understands bitcoin’s fundamental value is hard to quantify, and focuses on price as the principal metric that both shapes and is shaped by narratives. He assumes we have been waiting for specific triggers to drive up the price, that they have not materialized and therefore our narratives are wrong and bitcoin is not doing well.

Both Joe and JPMorgan seem to believe the overriding narrative for bitcoin today is that of speculative asset. This is a valid viewpoint, but not one that I share – for me, bitcoin is a technology play that will change the meaning of markets.

I also don’t buy into Joe’s focus on price, and his assumption the market as a whole expects sharp movements based on certain catalysts.

And I’m not convinced by JPMorgan’s conclusion that recent price action points to bitcoin’s continued use as a speculative asset – this week CoinDesk reported more than 60% of bitcoin held in wallets has not moved in over a year.

Thinking about why I disagreed, however, made me realize something I have been overlooking. I have always regarded bitcoin’s lack of a clear narrative as a strength. I was wrong – it is both a strength and a weakness.

The plus and the minus

It’s a strength in that the story is still unfolding. Bitcoin’s main use case is yet to be determined. Many see it as a store of value, in that it has no explicit economic drivers other than a limited supply. Others see it as a speculative asset that swings on sentiment and whose volatility can be harnessed to produce higher returns. For part of the world, it is a stable currency. For some, a venture investment.

In other words, bitcoin is not a one-trick pony – the demand growth from any one of its many narratives could be enough to push up its value.

Having many threads to pull on is also a weakness, however, because investors like clear narratives. Professional managers generally need to justify their allocation decisions, and bitcoin’s story is confusing. Even Paul Tudor Jones expressed skepticism at the success of his preferred narrative, that of digital gold, but invested anyway based on probabilities and price. Bitcoin’s lack of a clear value and a diluted understanding of its fundamentals lead many smart people such as Joe to focus on price performance as a barometer for success. It’s there, easy to watch, easy to track. And in a markets-centric world, that’s good enough for some.

Value, on the other hand, depends partly on fundamentals, which in the case of cryptocurrencies are still poorly understood. It also depends on sentiment, which is the result of stories and expectations, not just of cryptocurrencies but also of environments and influencing factors. You think bitcoin has confusing narratives? Let’s talk about tech stocks, oil, the dollar, take your pick.

So while I still believe rapidly evolving narratives around bitcoin are an opportunity, and that the fundamental value drivers of the cryptocurrency will become better understood with time and patience, I also accept now that a lack of clarity around what those are makes the price an understandable value proxy for many.

The formula

However, recent market trends have shown us price is increasingly disassociated from value, not just in cryptocurrencies. In today’s stock, bond and even currency markets, price is often totally out of whack with the underlying potential. It doesn’t mean that price is not important; it just means that it’s not something that should be taken as a proxy for value – or for success – as we look forward.

As an industry, we need to work on honing our understanding of the many narratives, and how they can influence value. We all need to learn to ask deeper questions, to entertain conflicting ideas and to accept that we just don’t know what the winning story – if there is one – will be. We’re getting better at metrics, a broader range of people are participating and our collective understanding is moving forward every day. But stories evolve, as they must to survive. We need to work on giving the stories scrutiny, as well as a broader vocabulary and set of tools that can enhance their telling.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

Talk about conflicting signals: Stocks seem to be pricing in a booming economy, bonds are forecasting a protracted downturn in spite of heavy government and central bank buying, and currencies are all over the place. Given the momentum, investors seem to be accepting this conflict – the worry is that it becomes the new normal.

Signs of a COVID-19 resurgence, though, are causing some jitters – but even so, the reality of the economic damage does not seem to have sunk in, in spite of even the Chairman of the Federal Reserve warning of hardship ahead.

Chain links

WisdomTree Trust has filed for an ETF that may invest up to 5% of its net assets in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) bitcoin futures contracts. If approved, the rest of the fund would be invested in traditional commodities. TAKEAWAY: Early last year Reality Shares filed an exchange-traded fund proposal that included a partial investment in bitcoin futures, but the application was withdrawn at the SEC’s request. It’s possible the market and regulatory sentiment have evolved over the past 16 months such that this filing will meet a different fate – to start, there are differentiating technicalities between this filing and last year’s, and the bitcoin futures market has grown considerably. But we shouldn’t hold our breath. If it does get approved, it will not have the same market impact as a straightforward bitcoin ETF, given the fund’s limited exposure and focus on the futures markets.

Asset manager Wilshire Phoenixhas filed to launch a bitcoin investment trust. TAKEAWAY: Like the Grayscale* bitcoin trust, if approved this will list on an OTC market and have fixed redemptions. Grayscale’s GBTC bitcoin trust is often criticized for the high premium retail investors have to pay to buy shares on the secondary market. If approved, this trust could add competition and reduce the premiums. Or, in the absence of a bitcoin ETF, demand could grow such that we’ll have two sets of high premiums. (*Grayscale is owned by DCG, the parent of CoinDesk.)

Mason Privatbank Liechtenstein AG has become the latest private bank to offer digital asset custody through a partnership with Hong Kong-based Hex Trust. TAKEAWAY: News about European private banks offering crypto services seems to be gracing our headlinesmore frequently these days. These banks tend to be small by U.S. standards, but they focus on institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals, so their potential reach when it comes to crypto services is significant. And the range of services they are offering is similar to full prime brokerage, with trading, custody, lending and banking services rolled into one. We will most likely see more announcements like this in the remainder of the year, each of which provide new onramps to satisfy the growing interest they expect to see.

After two years of development, Komainu – a joint venture between Nomura Holdings, CoinShares and Ledger – has launched to offer crypto asset custody to institutional investors. TAKEAWAY: The entity is based in the U.K.’s Jersey Channel Islands, and will provide custody, compliance and insurance services. The pedigree of the partners is interesting: Nomura is one of Japan’s largest investment banks (yes, a legacy bank investing in crypto custody!), and Ledger is one of the sector’s original custodians. CoinShares is one of the sector’s longest-running asset managers (as well as manager of a handful of listed crypto funds), and now also provides trading services, index management and tokenized assets. With the addition of custody, could CoinShares be angling to break into the crypto prime brokerage business?

Codefi, backed by Ethereum development group ConsenSys, is working on an Eth 2.0 staking API, which aims to help large exchanges, wallet providers, custodians and funds earn income from a portion of their crypto asset holdings. TAKEAWAY: As the launch of the transition to Ethereum’s new blockchain nears*, interest in staking seems to be growing. This could pick up steam as demand is fueled by the record-low yields on other traditional asset groups, and as service providers become more robust and user-friendly. (*TEASER: We will soon be publishing a report on what this transition means for Ethereum and for investors.)

Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer Ebang estimates it incurred a net loss of $2.5 million on a revenue of $6.4 million for Q1 2020. This disclosure was posted this week in an update to the firm’s IPO prospectus filed with the SEC. TAKEAWAY: A Chinese loss-making company trying to raise shares in a U.S. listing? In these crazy markets, it could do very well. However, the listing may be denied due to a lack of inspected audits – or for a lack of revenue, or a number of other reasons. (For a detailed breakdown of the Ebang filing, see our report “Ebang IPO: Dude, where’s my revenue?”)

According to data from crypto analytics firm Glassnode, over 60% of all bitcoins have not moved in at least a year. TAKEAWAY: Contrary to some analyses (see THE BRIEFING above), this indicates that the buy-and-hold strategy is gaining ground. True, a chunk of these coins may be in wallets with lost keys, but the overall trend indicates that holders are still holding. The number of bitcoin that hasn’t moved in 2-3 years grew by over 25%.

Jeff Dorman of Arca Funds compares the crypto asset universe to the bond market, arguing that the two asset groups have much in common in terms of investor specialization and arcane math. TAKEAWAY: Great insight into how valuation models are still evolving, and have a way to go still.

The Financial Services Commission of Mauritiushas created a regulatory regime for a full-fledged security token ecosystem. TAKEAWAY: This is interesting given that the island state was one of the early sovereign nations to embrace the potential of becoming a blockchain hub, and is pretty far along in setting up legal frameworks for a wide range of crypto-related businesses. Combine that with its status as a tax haven that has attracted a growing base of high-net-worth individuals, and the imminent likely blacklisting by Europe as a “high-risk third country,” and you can start to catch a glimpse of where fully functioning crypto financial system could flex its resilience, even if it’s at a small scale. Worth watching.

Over a recent 30-day period, the total open interest for CME bitcoin options increased more than tenfold to over $370 million, making it the second largest bitcoin options market in the industry, behind Deribit. TAKEAWAY: Open interest for Deribit has also reached all-time highs, almost double the 2019 high reached almost exactly a year ago. This growth indicates a solid maturation of the crypto markets overall, and could unleash increasingly aggressive trading strategies as risk-takers feel more comfortable with the hedging tools available.

Chairman Jay Clayton is geared to leave the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after President Donald Trump nominates him to serve as the next U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. With his departure, the cryptocurrency industry is hopeful that the SEC will finally approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Jay Clayton Exiting SEC, What It Means for Crypto and Bitcoin ETF Approval

The U.S. Department of Justice released a statement by Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday. “President Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, currently the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to serve as the new United States attorney for the Southern District of New York,” the statement reads. “On behalf of the president, I thank Jay for accepting this nomination.”

Clayton’s impending exit as the SEC chairman has many people speculate how the change will affect the cryptocurrency industry, including the likelihood of a bitcoin ETF being approved by the SEC.

Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, tweeted: “The SEC chair is one of the most important U.S. officials for crypto regulation. Chairman Clayton’s replacement will have a massive impact on the industry (for better or worse). Our chance at ETF approval & clarity on a wide range of issues for years to come hangs in the balance.”

Billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz said: “Have to think [Jay Clayton] leaving the SEC is good for BTC. Makes ETF more likely. Let’s hope his successor is a futurist.”

Michael Arrington, founder of Techcrunch, Crunchbase and Arrington XRP Capital, commented on Twitter:

Whatever else, Jay Clayton leaving the SEC is a win for crypto and sound money fans across the world. Hopefully he does less damage as a US atty.

Under Clayton’s watch, all proposals for a bitcoin ETF have been rejected. A bitcoin skeptic, he said in September last year that he does not see bitcoin trading on a major exchange until it is “better regulated.” The chairman raised several concerns such as the difficulty of price discovery for investors trying to cash in on crypto. James Angel, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Cointelegraph, “We won’t see it [bitcoin ETF] on Jay Clayton’s watch.”

Meanwhile, the SEC has a crypto-friendly commissioner. Hester Peirce, often known as “crypto mom,” has been nominated for a second term as an SEC commissioner. She has been trying to convince her colleagues at the commission that the time is right for approving a bitcoin ETF. Last month, Peirce said there is an increasing demand for crypto, especially among institutional investors. She put forward the Token Safe Harbor Proposal in February “to fill the gap between regulation and decentralization.” It gives token issuers a three-year exemption from federal securities laws. Some people in the crypto space want Peirce to take the role of the SEC chairman after Clayton leaves. In February, crypto mom said:

The Commission’s approach to these bitcoin exchange-traded products is frustrating because it evinces a stubborn stodginess in the face of innovation.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. derivatives regulator, Heath Tarbert, has called on other regulators to take a less restrictive and tailored approach to crypto regulation. Furthermore, President Trump recently appointed pro-crypto Brian Brooks, former general counsel at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, as the top banking regulator.

Clayton will remain as chairman of the SEC while the Senate considers his nomination. In addition, current U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman reportedly refused to step down until Clayton is confirmed by the Senate.

There are scores of ways you can trade and invest in cryptocurrencies.

Sure, you can buy and HODL or frantically day-trade to catch the day’s highs and lows. But how about going beyond all that? How about using the techniques traders in other markets apply when they invest?

It’s time to learn a little more about forex scalping – and how you might be able to apply it to your own trading strategy in the crypto markets.

What Is Forex Scalping?

If you have ever dabbled in forex trading, chances are you will probably have come across the term scalping.

In currency trading, scalping (also known as scalp trading) refers to when a trader makes a large number of small transactions to profit off small price movements throughout the day.

By generating dozens (or even hundreds) of short-term trades a day, successful scalp traders can generate sizable daily trading profits. And they can do this despite the fact that they are essentially engaging in a relatively low-risk trading strategy in a volatile market.

To execute this type of strategy, traders usually deploy a system that provides them with trading signals – often based on technical indicators – that they use to make buying and selling decisions.

Because machines can execute technical indicator-based trades faster than humans, most experienced forex traders use trading bots to help them execute their scalp trading strategy effectively.

Additionally, traders use leverage to amplify their potential trading profits, to allow them to put only a small amount of capital into each trade they make.

Risk management is another important factor for scalp traders.

To execute this type of trading strategy, traders put tight stop-loss limits and price targets in place to ensure that no trade ends up losing too much money.

Seasoned traders will use trading software that executes stop-loss limits and price targets automatically – effectively taking emotion out of the equation.

Can Crypto Traders Scalp Trade Too?

Due to the similarities between traditional fiat markets and the cryptocurrency market, there is already a large number of crypto traders out there who use scalping strategies. And crypto trading bots have become so advanced that the same sort of theories can easily be applied by bitcoin (BTC) traders.

However, the reason why scalp trading is so popular in the foreign exchange market comes down to the fact that it is a multi-trillion dollar market with ample liquidity in its largest trading pairs.

The crypto markets, on the other hand, only have a daily exchange trading volume of around USD 100 billion, and a big chunk of that is taken up by bitcoin.

That means – aside from BTC/USD and BTC/TUSD (TrueUSD) pairings – there aren’t many crypto trading pairs available that let you successfully execute an automated scalp trading strategy using leverage.

So yes, you can scalp trade bitcoin and maybe ethereum (ETH). But you can’t just pick any coin and start scalping. Especially when that coin lacks liquidity.

How to Set up a Crypto Scalping Trading Strategy

If you do decide that crypto scalping is for you, on paper, getting started is actually quite easy. You could start by following the steps below:

Decide on the trading pairs you want to scalp. Sign up to a trading platform that provides high liquidity in your chosen trading pairs. Get a trading bot that allows you to execute a wide range of technical indicator-based trading strategies. Develop and backtest scalping strategies until you find one that works. Live-test the trading strategies and make sure all risk management measures work in the live markets. Start scalping!

Pros and Cons of Crypto Scalping

Like all crypto trading strategies, there are plenty of advantages and disadvantages involved with crypto scalping. Here are a few:

Pros

It is a relatively low-risk trading strategy that can be automatically executed using trading bots.

Once you have found the right indicators and bot settings for you, you can generate regular trading profits without really needing to get involved on a micro level.

Cons

Without trading software, it is difficult to successfully execute this strategy.

Finding the right indicators can involve conducting a substantial amount of backtesting, which can be time-consuming.

Although scalping is usually considered to be a relatively low-risk trading strategy, you can still lose your trading capital.

Trading fees do tend to add up and could eat into your profits.

Scalping: Is it for Everyone?

Scalping is just one of many ways to trade the markets.

However, it isn’t for everyone. Remember that unless you are an experienced trader, it may pay to buy and HODL the tokens that you believe will increase in value over time. But if scalping sounds like your thing, why not give it a try?",,https://news.bitcoin.com/hundreds-of-sites-now-earn-crypto-trading-fees-exchange-wordpress-plugin-sees-300-active-installs/,"Hundreds of Sites Now Earn Crypto Trading Fees: Exchange Wordpress Plugin Sees 300 Active Installs

A couple of months ago, a new WordPress (WP) plugin launched that allows anyone to host a digital currency trading platform. With the application, WP website owners can earn fees from various crypto asset trades. The developer of the plugin called “Wpcryptoexchange” tweeted on June 19, that there are now 300 active installs of his Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin.

On April 22, 2020, news.Bitcoin.com reported on a new platform called the “Wpcryptoexchange” or the Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin. For now, the application allows people to trade various cryptocurrencies including ETH, DAI, BAT, and WBTC using someone’s WordPress site that has the plugin installed. Other cryptocurrencies may be added to the roster of Wpcryptoexchange supported coins in the future.

The developer Alon Goren from the firm, Goren Holm, released the new WordPress (WP) so literally anyone can create a crypto exchange on any WP-based site. The platform leverages the Totle application programming interface (API) and the website wpcryptoexchange.com gives WP website owners simple to follow, step-by-step installation instructions.

Since the initial launch, Goren revealed on June 19, the Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin now has roughly 300 active installs. “Just checked and there are over 300 active installs of the Crypto Exchange WordPress Plugin,” Goren tweeted. The developer added:

That means because of ME (& Totlecrypto), there are over 300 more websites on the internet that allow you to swap tokens on them.

In order for people to leverage Goren’s Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin, all they need to do is download the zip file and give the plugin privileges from the WP admin. After activating the plugin, anyone can have their “own cryptocurrency exchange that will route the trades across all decentralized exchanges,” the developer’s website details.

WP website owners can customize trading fees and even set fees at zero if they prefer. The application is backed by the company Draper Goren Holm, which is a “blockchain venture studio,” associated with the well known venture capitalist Tim Draper. Goren’s Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin that uses the Totle API, can work with a number of digital currency wallets that support the Ethereum chain and ERC20 tokens.

Goren’s Crypto Exchange WP plugin also has a step-by-step tutorial on how website owners can customize colors and window sizes by using custom CSS code. Essentially these configurations can transform how the crypto exchange looks and feels to visitors. Further, there’s a walkthrough and Youtube video available, so WP owners can learn how to earn trading fees from decentralized crypto exchanges in a passive manner.

The video leverages the Metamask wallet and it “walks you through the whole process, including running a test transaction,” explains the website’s guide.

In order to follow along and test the fee settings with the video presentation, a WP install with Crypto Exchange Plugin activated is required. Also an “ethereum wallet on Metamask with some ETH for gas fees,” the website notes.

A WP website owner can test some transactions to make sure the exchange and fee collection is operating efficiently. The developers say that exchange operators can simply check the Totle Partner Console to inspect trade volume and collect trading fees.

With the Draper Goren Holm created plugin increasing the number of active installs, it provides the public with a myriad of individuals offering a crypto trading experience on any WP-based website. Regulators who are quite busy cracking down on the massively large exchanges, will have a hard time stopping free-market crypto trades if Goren’s platform continues to grow.

What do you think about the Crypto Exchange WordPress plugin’s 300 active installs? Let us know in the comments section below.

Compound gives borrower an edge over MakerDAO, but fundamentals were not the reason for this rally

If the price of COMP decreases, the incentives for using Compound will also diminish

Whether liquidity mining is a sustainable incentive mechanism remains to be seen

Share this article

Compound has overtaken MakerDAO to become the single largest protocol in DeFi. Over the last week, Compound has grown from $93 million of value locked to $533 million on the back of a new incentive scheme.

A New Leader Emerges

For the first time since the DeFi narrative came to life, MakerDAO is no longer the most valuable protocol. At the time of writing, Compound stands tall at $533 million of value locked versus Maker’s $482 million.

Compound’s rise over the last few days is a testament to the power of incentives in a financial ecosystem. Lending and borrowing activity has been berserk. At times, the return for borrowing assets has exceeded the performance of lending assets. This is a result of COMP’s price going over 10x in a few days.

Even in terms of token market cap, COMP took down MKR to become the single most valuable DeFi token. And displacing MakerDAO just seems to be the beginning. Compound not only allows for lenders to earn a return on their non-productive capital, but the protocol also gives borrowers better capital efficiency with a lower collateral ratio and more assets to borrow against.

However, Compound’s fundamentals have remained in the backseat for the majority of this rally. It boils down to the incentive Compound’s users receive from using the protocol.

When one lends or borrows money from Compound, they receive COMP as part of the liquidity mining initiative. So along with the yield of lending a crypto asset, lenders (and borrowers) also receive some amount of COMP as compensation. By compensating users with native tokens, it boosted the earnings DeFi users can make through Compound, accelerating total value locked in the protocol.

If it weren’t for the launch of COMP, rates on Compound would’ve been the same—perhaps even lower than competitors like Aave. The introduction of COMP increased lender yields by default. Borrowers, too, were given an incentive they couldn’t turn away: the ability to milk yields by merely borrowing money. COMP’s price appreciation further augmented this.

However, these yields aren’t sustainable. The capital flowing into Compound to juice COMP yields could disappear when the next best thing shows up with annualized returns above 100%. But, if COMP maintains its price in this range, or continues its uptrend, a lot of this capital could stick around and continue to farm yields.

Currently, PayPal can be used as an alternative means for withdrawing funds from exchanges such as Coinbase, but this would be a first in terms of offering direct sales of crypto.

“My understanding is that they are going to allow buys and sells of crypto directly from PayPal and Venmo,” a well-placed industry source told CoinDesk. “They are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there.”

It is unclear which or how many cryptocurrencies would be available. The industry source said they expected PayPal “would be working with multiple exchanges to source liquidity.”

A second source confirmed that PayPal is looking to offer buying and selling of crypto and said the service could be expected “in the next three months, maybe sooner.”

PayPal declined to comment on the plans.

San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp were mentioned as likely contenders by the sources. Both Coinbase and Bitstamp declined to comment.

It’s worth noting that PayPal has a longstanding relationship with Coinbase, going back as early as 2016. In 2018, Coinbase made instant fiat withdrawals to PayPal available for U.S. customers. Last year, European Coinbase users could withdraw to their PayPal accounts, followed by users in Canada.

Meanwhile, fintech apps that offer crypto are making money. Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018. Cash App reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.

London-based Revolut, which began offering crypto to users following a 2017 partnership with Bitstamp, raised $500 million in February, valuing the platform at $5.5 billion. Robinhood, the fintech app thought to be fueling the recent retail boom in equities day trading, first offered crypto in February 2018.

Crypto is increasingly seen as an obvious way to bolster user numbers on fintech apps and create new revenue streams. Indeed, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has made it clear his plan this year is to aggressively monetize Venmo, which has over 52 million accounts.

Hiring push

Around the start of 2020, PayPal posted job openings to ramp up its new Blockchain Research Group. PayPal posted eight engineering positions: four in San Jose and four in Singapore.

Following PayPal’s short-lived dalliance with the Facebook-led Libra project last year, the focus now is expanding its own payments expertise, one of the sources added.

In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, PayPal Chief Technology Officer Sri Shivananda said the company wanted its own “perspective and view on [blockchain] technology itself to see how it can help us contribute to the concept of creating an open digital payments platform that can serve everyone.”

Shivananda said he was unable to comment on any of PayPal’s specific plans.",2020-06-22 16:59:45+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/paypal-venmo-planning-introduce-bitcoin-trading/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Rumors suggest PayPal and Venmo may add support for cryptocurrency via exchange integration

Past events show that PayPal is interested in blockchain

Today's news has not been confirmed by either company yet

Share this article

PayPal and Venmo are thinking about adding Bitcoin and crypto buying and selling, according to sources contacted by CoinDesk. Such a feature would help accelerate mainstream adoption.

How the Feature Might Work

The feature would allow users to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins directly from their online account by connecting to a third-party exchange such as Coinbase or Bitstamp. One of Coindesk’s sources stated:

My understanding is that they are going to allow [buying and selling] of crypto directly from PayPal and Venmo…They are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there.

PayPal could source its liquidity from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, one source reported. Another source suggested that PayPal and Venmo may add the feature within the next three months.

News Is Highly Speculative

This news is highly speculative, and it has only been confirmed by anonymous sources. None of the companies mentioned above have confirmed that the feature will indeed be added to their payment platform. On the other hand, PayPal’s recent blockchain-related hire and its past involvement in Facebook Libra could be evidence that it is actively pursuing cryptocurrency products.

The fact that PayPal owns Venmo supports the theory that both services may add the feature at the same time.

In terms of timing, CoinDesk reported that, according to one source, the service may become available in the next several months.

The force’s Asset Recovery Unit moved to freeze the funds amid a global investigation into the activities of the exchange and its operators, according to a report by news source NZ Herald.

U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Vinnik controlled BTC-e, a bitcoin exchange used to launder billions of dollars for criminal enterprises. Vinnik, who has been denying the charges for up to three years, was arrested based on extradition orders from the U.S. while on holiday with family in Greece in 2017.

Cryptocurrency analysts and investors say XRP is likely underperforming this year because of regulatory pressure, slow growth as a payments solution and a lack of classic proof-of-work mining that generates fresh supply for the trading market. Such negatives have outweighed bullish factors that include a reduced pace of sales by the XRP software developer Ripple and signs of progress in a partnership with the payments transmitter MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI).

“Even throughout this most recent bull crypto market run, there has rarely ever been anyone discussing XRP,” said Jack Tan, managing partner at Taiwan-based trading firm Kronos Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

XRP’s lagging returns follow an abysmal 2019, when the price fell 45% while bitcoin more than doubled. The token’s share of the overall digital-asset market capitalization has tumbled to 3%, from 12% early last year, according to metrics compiled by TradingView.

Mike Novogratz, whose firm Galaxy Digital owns a $29 million stake in XRP software developer Ripple, according to a Q1 2020 filing, said in January at a conference he thought XRP would “underperform immensely again” this year. He wasn’t wrong.

“We can’t control, nor do we focus on, the price of XRP day to day,” a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. “What Ripple is thinking about is the utility of XRP, and building solutions that solve real problems with global payments.”

XRP has been one of the crypto industry’s most popular assets since 2012. That year, as an alternative to bitcoin, the founders of what would become San Francisco-based Ripple gifted the company 80 billion XRP out of a total 100 billion created.

The leading software company working on XRP, Ripple is a startup with over 530 employees, according to LinkedIn, and has raised over $286 million in venture capital from firms including Galaxy. Major product offerings from the company include RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which are used to facilitate fast and cheap payments.

XRP is notable for an often vocal and devoted community of backers, who sometimes refer to themselves as the XRP Army and support both the cryptocurrency and Ripple. There are also investment firms backing the cryptocurrency.

“XRP is a perfect currency for what we do,” Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch who now runs Arrington XRP Capital, one of the largest XRP investment funds, said in a phone interview.

XRP’s properties of being fast and cheap – Arrington said he’s been able to move millions of dollars in the digital asset for as little as $0.45 – is one major reason why the fund likes its future potential.

“Right now we think XRP is dramatically undervalued,” he said. “All else being equal, we’re buyers at these prices. Maybe not leverage buyers, but we think it’s undervalued.”

Just last week, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo said XRP deserved to be considered a cryptocurrency, not a security. Giancarlo is now a senior partner at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where Ripple is a client.

The question of whether XRP might be declared a security has haunted the asset because a declaration to that effect by the Securities and Exchange Commission would likely subject the token and its ecosystem to stricter regulations and potentially enforcement actions. Multiple lawsuits, one filed as recently as May, allege XRP should be a security.

XRP’s price didn’t really budge in response to Giancarlo’s comments, possibly an indication traders are still waiting to hear from the SEC on the matter.

Another overhang is sales of tokens into the market: Ripple Labs does sell XRP to raise cash, although according to a first-quarter market report published by the company its sales of the tokens dropped to $1.75 million during the first three months of the year, down 86% from fourth-quarter levels.

One of the biggest users of XRP is the payments transmitter MoneyGram, which received a $50 million equity investment from Ripple Labs last year. Upon completion of the investment in November, MoneyGram announced 10% of the company’s Mexican peso foreign exchange liquidity was already using Ripple’s ODL product to move money.

In February, Ripple Labs executive Ashseeh Birla provided an update on MoneyGram’s progress using its technology:

In the first quarter of 2020, MoneyGram reported it was able to reduce its operating expenses with a $12.1 million “benefit” derived from “Ripple market development fees.” However, there’s no further information about the growth of ODL within the company’s business lines other than that the partnership, valid through July 2023, is expected to continue to reduce expenses.

Ripple Labs has formed relationships with hundreds of partners, including Bank of America, which has reportedly piloted some of its technology.

But banks might be worried about holding the tokens for fear of having to report any gains or losses to shareholders or supervisors, Haohan Xu, CEO of cryptocurrency liquidity provider Apifiny, wrote in an email message.

“This is especially given the different regulations across the globe, and being exposed to the volatility risk when holding XRP,” Xu said.

So can demand for XRP be driven by usage or expected usage of its network for payments? How will XRP’s regulatory issues conclude? Does selling pressure from a lack of proof-of-work mining create some concern among traders?

“XRP is an interesting crypto asset because whilst the fundamentals seem to indicate growth and greater adoption, the price action is showing the opposite,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Bitcoin watch

BTC: Price: $9,432 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,441 | 24-Hr Low: $9,273

Trend: While bitcoin is flashing green at press time, it is still trading within the narrow range of $9,000–$10,000 it’s been largely stuck in for over a month.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $9,440, representing a 1.5% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Prices are rangebound for the 11th straight day amid mixed signals on the technical charts. On the bullish side, the three-day 50- and 100-candle moving averages (MA) have produced a bullish crossover. A similar cross accelerated the uptrend in June 2019 and marked the beginning of a multi-year bull run in October 2015.

However, the three-day MACD histogram, an MA-based indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero for the first time since early April, confirming a bearish reversal. The daily chart, too, is reporting conflicting signals with the MACD hovering below zero and the 50- and 200-day SMAs, signaling a bull market.

With indicators lacking consensus on the potential direction of the next range breakout, traders will be waiting for a strong directional cue to emerge.

A UTC close above $10,000 would restore the bull run from the March low of $3,867 and open the doors for a $1,000 rally. On the way higher, the February high of $10,500 could offer resistance.

Alternatively, a move below $9,000 will likely yield a sell-off to the 200-day SMA at $8,267.",2020-06-22 12:51:36+00:00,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-experts-reveal-thoughts-how-will-bitcoin-perform-after-the-covid-19-crisis-has-passed-301081094.html,"LONDON, June 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- To educate Crypto-enthusiasts and prepare them for upcoming market conditions, a group of well-respected crypto experts brought together by Investoo Group has expressed their thoughts on the recent COVID-19 crisis, and its effect on the global crypto markets.

Investoo Group

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our daily lives, our ability to interact and our financial structures and security. Blockchain technology has been around for over a decade, and there are now thousands of projects that seek to utilize its limitless potential to solve some of the world's most pressing issues.

Coin Journal has assembled a veteran team of experts in the field of cryptocurrency and financial technology, to gain some valuable insights into what the world may look like after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Globally, we can only hope that containment of this danger is now within our grasp, but we can only speculate to the long-term impact that it will leave in its wake.

Heavyweight Opinion

The panel is headed by Yoni Assia, the CEO of the world's largest social investment network, eToro. Yoni also brought his market analyst and renowned crypto expert, Simon Peters to the table. The next to join the team, Ciara Sun, is currently employed as the Head of Global Markets at Huobi Group, a global blockchain financial asset service provider. The panel also has the founder of virtual currency platform, Coincurve, and CEO of Interlapse, Wayne Chen. Finally, the panel would not be complete without the 15-year veteran of Wall Street technology and CEO of BSV blockchain service provider, TAAL; Mr. Jerry Chan.

They discuss the potential effects of unlimited quantitative easing, the need for a Universal Basic Income (UBI), and how blockchain technology can be a tool for research teams to interact with transparency on a global scale. The team reveals evidence that shows how cryptocurrency stands resilient against the economic downturn caused by social distancing measures and the closure of businesses that have succumbed to the strain.

Article Excerpts

Speaking exclusively to Coin Journal on the idea of Bitcoin as a 'safe haven' asset, eToro CEO Yoni Assia noted that crypto and fiat markets moved in tandem at the start of the COVID-19 panic. Market Analyst Simon Peters then noted a shift, which he describes below:

""Interestingly, this is backed-up by eToro's platform data, which shows a 77% increase in new registrants whose first action was to invest in Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin is traveling in the same direction as gold, you could argue investors view it as a safe haven asset.""

Other areas of the article speak about the survival of market segments, and the implementation of blockchain technology, especially across supply chains. TAAL CEO Jerry Chan had thoughts relating to limiting the spread of COVID-19 using blockchain technology:

""Pharmaceutical companies have realised the potential application of a scalable version of Bitcoin blockchain, which can be used to track COVID-19 testing and vaccination records, cross-state and cross-borders, in a way which could be used to corroborate or validate statistics submitted to global health organisations.""

SOURCE Investoo Group",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australians-lost-more-than-14m-to-crypto-scams-in-2019,"Australians filed 1,810 reports of cryptocurrency-related scams in 2019, collectively totaling more than $21.6 million AU ($14.9 million USD).

According to a study by Scamwatch, an arm of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, younger Australians aged 25 to 34 were those most heavily affected by crypto investment scams.

According to the report:

“Cloud mining farms became a common adaptation of this type of scam. Most were Ponzi schemes, with no real cryptocurrency involved.”

It goes on to characterize cloud crypto mining as an “an incredibly resource-intensive activity” that relies on powerful computing systems to mine a coin. This is the concept scammers are building their deception on, asking people to invest in nonexistent server time or space.

Crypto-related scams are on the rise

Scamwatch’s study reveals a sharp increase in total losses related to scams over the past two years, from $234 million in 2017 to $437 million in 2019.

One example from the report is an international Ponzi-style scam calling itself “USI Tech.” It hit Australia in 2019, and Scamwatch received over 200 reports totaling losses of $ 2.2 million paid irreversibly in Bitcoin (BTC). Scamwatch’s report says that USI Tech is now known as one of the “biggest cryptocurrency scams in the world.”

CrossTower said its platform supports highly active order books and tight spreads for crypto-to-crypto trading. Launched last month, users can trade nine of the most frequently traded cryptocurrencies on the crypto exchange operatorâs platform, including bitcoin, ether, XRP and Zcash.

The firmâs co-founder and president, Kristin Boggiano, said CrossTower was launched at a time of change in the financial markets.Â

âJurisdictions and governments around the world are increasingly embracing crypto finance to avail more efficient payment, trading and investment services,â she said.Â

She added that while the firm is not chasing a specific volume of users, its mission is to make investing in digital assets more mainstream.Â

âWhile CrossTower aims at a wide market, the institutional-ready approach is one of the foundersâ most appealing and distinguishing strengths,â said Gerard Lopez, speaking about what attracted him towards making an investment in CrossTowerâs platform.Â

CrossTower co-founder and CEO Kapil Rathi said what distinguishes the firmâs trading platform from all the others on the market was its âget paid to tradeâ pricing model. According to Rathi, the model upsets the status quo by offering rebates to takers and charging a nominal fee to market makers.

âThis fee structure is designed to draw traders to the system as we will pay takers of liquidity 1 bps of the value of each trade,â Rathi said.

In his view, the model can also provide substantial liquidity to market makers.

The news was first reported by Coindesk, which cited three people familiar with the matter. “They are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there,” one of the sources told the publication, adding that they expect PayPal to “be working with multiple exchanges to source liquidity.”

A second source said the service could be available in the next three months or sooner. Both PayPal and Venmo declined to comment on the news.

If PayPal’s plan follows through, it will open a huge door for retail cryptocurrency investors. As of the end of 2019, PayPal had 305 active users, whereas Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the U.S., has 11.7 million users. And Binance, one of the world’s largest, has only 15 million.

There’s general consensus among Fintech industry players that it’s a natural move for PayPal to finally build a crypto product. Its primary fintech rival, Square, entered the game back in 2018 when it launched Bitcoin transactions in its Cash App. In the first quarter of 2020, the service generated $306 million in Bitcoin revenue alone.

“After Square’s large success with Bitcoin trading on their P2P payments app CashApp, it was inevitable companies such as Venmo and PayPal to follow suit,” Guy Hirsch, U.S. Managing Director of the global crypto trading platform eToro, told Observer. “These large Fintech payment firms see an opportunity for significant growth in the crypto market, specifically with the ability to share transactions socially on the platform.”

PayPal already has a partnership with the crypto exchange Coinbase that allows users (in North America and Europe) to withdraw and deposit cash between the two platforms. PayPal was also briefly a member of Facebook’s Libra Association last year before the ambitious crypto project fell apart.

Venmo became a PayPal company in 2013 through a corporate acquisition. At the end of 2019, the payment service had 52 million registered users. At PayPal’s 2019 Q4 earnings release in January, CEO Dan Schulman told investors that “monetizing Venmo” is a top company priority this year.

“There’s a lot of work going on around that right now, because we think that’s a very big opportunity that we did not take as much advantage of last year as we probably could have,” Schulman said of Venmo.

In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, PayPal’s Chief Technology Officer Sri Shivananda also hinted on the company’s blockchain progress. “We are a strong believer in the potential of blockchain. The digitization of currency is only a matter of when not if,” Shivananda said.",2020-06-23 16:14:29+00:00,https://asiatimes.com/2020/06/paypal-to-let-users-buy-and-sell-crypto/,"Fintech giant PayPal plans to offer direct sales of cryptocurrency to its 325 million users, according to industry sources, a move many observers believe will lead to a huge surge in demand globally.

Currently, PayPal can be used as an alternative means for withdrawing funds from exchanges such as Coinbase, but this would be a first in terms of offering direct sales of crypto, Yahoo Finance reported.

“My understanding is that they are going to allow buys and sells of crypto directly from PayPal and Venmo,” a well-placed industry source told CoinDesk. “They are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there.”

It is unclear which or how many cryptocurrencies would be available. The industry source said they expected PayPal “would be working with multiple exchanges to source liquidity.”

A second source confirmed that PayPal is looking to offer buying and selling of crypto and said the service could be expected “in the next three months, maybe sooner.”

PayPal declined to comment on the plans.

San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp were mentioned as likely contenders by the sources. Both Coinbase and Bitstamp declined to comment.

It’s worth noting that PayPal has a longstanding relationship with Coinbase, going back as early as 2016. In 2018, Coinbase made instant fiat withdrawals to PayPal available for US customers. Last year, European Coinbase users could withdraw to their PayPal accounts, followed by users in Canada.

Meanwhile, fintech apps that offer crypto are making money. Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoinpurchases in its Cash App in mid-2018. Cash App reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.

London-based Revolut, which began offering crypto to users following a 2017 partnership with Bitstamp, raised $500 million in February, valuing the platform at $5.5 billion. Robinhood, the fintech app thought to be fueling the recent retail boom in equities day trading, first offered crypto in February 2018.

Crypto is increasingly seen as an obvious way to bolster user numbers on fintech apps and create new revenue streams. Indeed, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has made it clear his plan this year is to aggressively monetize Venmo, which has over 52 million accounts.

Hiring push

PayPal’s recent hiring push supports the claim that it is moving into crypto.

The global payments platform’s job listings, posted on PayPal’s own boards, include a request for a technical lead/cryptocurrency engineer set to join a team in Chennai, India, ZDNet reported.

A successful applicant would become part of PayPal’s “Crypto Engineering Team” in the region, which the company says is “responsible for new initiatives for PayPal global with focus on agility, time to market and innovation.” This includes the development of crypto-related products and features that are suitable for the PayPal platform.

The listing emphasizes the need for someone able to build and maintain Internet applications and services, with a focus on expertise in security, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, crypto libraries, and software development.

The second listing of note asks for a blockchain research engineer to work with the company in exploring emerging technologies and their potential applications within PayPal.

Crypto community’s reaction

News of PayPal’s reported move elicited an excited reaction from the crypto Twitterati.

The Wolf of All Stress tweeted: “If PayPal and Venmo are truly entering crypto, then this is arguably the most bullish news that we have seen in the space… ever.”

This week digital currency enthusiasts have been discussing network fees, specifically transaction fees associated with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Last Sunday on June 21, one Ethereum proponent noted that during the last 16 days, Ethereum users have paid more to leverage the network than Bitcoin users.

Digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, and litecoin all have a network or miner fee associated with sending each and every transaction. This means in order to send a fraction of bitcoin (BTC), there must be enough BTC in the wallet to also cover the sending fee.

At the time of publication, the data site bitinfocharts.com shows the average BTC network fee was $1.14 per transaction on June 22. Ethereum (ETH) network fees show the average fee on that day was around $0.62 per send. Bitcoin cash (BCH) has an average fee of $0.006 per transaction or six-tenths of a U.S. penny. Now not all BTC fee recording websites are exactly the same as there are many different averages depending on the site used.

According to the fee calculation website offered by billfodl.com, the next block fee required to have your transaction mined on the next block (10 minutes) is $0.87 today. Similarly, for June 23, the average fee for getting into the next three blocks is the same price. If an individual paid $0.73 per BTC fee, the transaction would possibly confirm within six blocks (1 hour).

The six-block fee would bring ETH transaction fees much closer to current BTC fees which bitinfocharts.com shows is $0.62. Coin Metrics charts show that ETH transaction fees have been consecutively higher than BTC’s fees in June. The well known ETH proponent on Twitter Eric.eth (Eric Conner – @econoar) told his 15,000 followers on Sunday:

For 16 straight days, Ethereum users have paid more to use the network than Bitcoin users.

Since the tweet, Ethereum transaction fees have dropped according to Coin Metrics data. The web portal ethgasstation.info, a website that provides ether gas price recommendations, notes that ETH fees are much lower than BTC’s average as far as stats on billfodl.com is concerned.

All the fees measured in gwei highlight that the gas amount it takes to send an ETH transaction and ERC20 token as well, is $0.26 for the fastest transaction confirmation time. Every tier lower is only a U.S. penny cheaper for standard and safe but low fee transactions.

Now during the last few years and especially since 2017, we know that when the price of ETH or BTC rises and is used more often, fees grow much larger. At the height of 2017, BTC fees jumped higher than $50 per transaction on December 22, 2017. On that same day, ETH fees were around $1.40 per ETH transaction.

Now, this occurrence doesn’t happen with bitcoin cash (BCH) since the block size has increased to 32MB. Before the block size upgrade, on that same day in mid-December 2017, the average BCH fee did rise to $0.31 per transaction. However, during the September 2018 stress tests, after confirming over 2.4 million transactions per day outshining BTC’s best day by 5x, the average BCH transaction (txn) fee was $0.003 per txn.

Since then BCH fees have not risen past the $0.008 txn fee naturally and have been consistently under a U.S. penny per transaction for the last two years. According to Coin Dance stats it is currently 815.51x more expensive to transact on Bitcoin (BTC) on June 23, 2020.

Transacting on the Bitcoin Cash chain is also much cheaper than transacting in ETH as it is 8,566.66% more expensive to transact in ETH than it is to leverage bitcoin cash. This data is all publicly available by leveraging sources like ethgasstation.info, bitinfocharts.com, Coin Metrics data, and billfodl.com.

What do you think about the difference in transaction fees between ETH and BTC lately? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

Cryptocurrency firms and companies including Ripple have started to respond to the upcoming change, which is being considered as a move forwards for the industry as it attempts to steer itself away from financial crime.

The Travel Rule is designed to restrict money laundering and terrorist financing by adopting an approach that requires all exchanges and digital asset providers to share customer information in order to create a more transparent ecosystem.

The Travel Rule Information Sharing Alliance (TRISA) is a decentralised company designed to help firms be compliant with the upcoming rules.

The TRISA model enables a global interoperable infrastructure for VASPs (Virtual Asset Providers) to determine which Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies are associated with which VASPs, and where to send the required customer and beneficiary information.

TRISA enables virtual asset service providers to meet critical compliance obligations

Yerra, Sr. Director, BSA & Sanctions at Ripple, said: “TRISA’s integration with the newly launched PayID enables regulated virtual currency companies to comply with Travel Rule requirements and to extract the information needed to meet other Financial Crime Compliance requirements such as AML transaction monitoring and sanctions screening.

“For the cryptocurrency industry to progress, solutions need to be open, easy to integrate and compliant with international law. TRISA’s solution stands out in its simplicity and security.”

Hardjono at MIT Connection Science, who is working with TRISA to create the CA whitepaper, added: “By adopting the ISO standard for digital certificates, with Extended Validation (EV) for VASP business information, TRISA ensures that VASPs in the ecosystem can readily comply to the Travel Rule. The use of the certificates protects VASPs and customers and provides the broadest possible interoperability with current and future trust infrastructures.”

There were also responses from the likes of Dave Jevans, Co-Chairman of TRISA and CEO of CipherTrace, who believes that “the proposed directory of VASPs combined with a CA model solves that problem by enabling the interoperability needed for universal Travel Rule compliance”.

When it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, choosing where to store it is nearly as important as buying it in the first place. So, what’s the best bitcoin wallet in 2020?

Just as you likely maintain a savings account for long-term money storage and a checking account for day-to-day debit card purchases, the top cryptocurrency wallet solution may actually involve at least two wallets.

The term “wallet” is a bit of a misnomer, as they don’t actually store funds. Instead, each wallet stores one or more private cryptographic keys, which are required to access cryptocurrency funds that live in many fragments on a decentralized online ledger known as the blockchain. It’s absolutely vital to keep your private keys safe.

To keep it simple, choosing the best bitcoin wallet for you basically boils down to a continuum with security on one end and ease of use on the other.

[Read: Bitcoin Halving 101: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?]

“One hundred percent security is not easy to use, and 100% easy-to-use is not necessarily secure,” says Caleb Chen, content marketing manager at Private Internet Access. “Depending on where you’re at, the solution might be multiple wallets.”

At the most secure end is what’s called cold storage. Physical wallets that store keys offline on a physical medium like paper are called “cold storage” wallets because they’re not linked to the “hot” internet — like a hot wallet — where cyber-criminals prowl. Cold storage can also refer to keeping a wallet on a dedicated computer that is not linked to the web.

However, these options aren’t the easiest to use if you need to access your cryptocurrency with relative haste. So if you’re considering multiple wallets, you’ll probably end up with a combination of a hardware wallet and a software wallet. Online wallets are also available, but they can come with a big caveat in terms of security.

So, if you’re interested in crypto wallets, here’s a breakdown of your options (outside of cold storage):

— Hardware wallets: Keys are stored in a small physical device that you connect to a computer or smartphone for transactions.

— Software wallets: Apps that you download to your mobile device or desktop.

— Online wallets: Browser-based wallets that allow you to interact with them like a website.

Hardware Wallets: Ledger, Trezor and Coinkite

For long-term storage, many people choose hardware wallets.

According to Nick Percoco, chief security officer with Kraken Digital Asset Exchange, hardware wallets are “a good balance between security and utility.”

Hardware wallets — of which Trezor and Ledger Nano S models are the most popular — are physical devices about the size of a keychain fob that store your private keys and can be kept separate from your desktop computer. Even when you do connect one to your computer to make a cryptocurrency transaction, any malware that might be on that desktop doesn’t have access to the wallet, Percoco says.

Ledger and Trezor wallets have become popular because of the user experience they offer, which includes support for many different cryptocurrencies and a solid physical look and feel that inspires confidence, Percoco says.

Eden Dhaliwal, global managing director at Conflux Network, likes the Bluetooth feature of the Ledger Nano X that lets you use it on desktop or mobile platforms without having to have it physically connected. “It’s the most simple to use for cross-chain support,” he says.

Dhaliwal also points to a hardware wallet from Coinkite. “It has a real crypto security chip where your private key is stored in a dedicated security chip, not the main micro’s flash,” he says. “It also has a micro SD card slot for backup and data storage which allows for truly offline signing.”

Software Wallets: Electrum and Jaxx

Here’s where security begins to give way to ease of use.

For instance, a bitcoin wallet on a computer that you use to browse the web is less secure than a hardware wallet because it’s susceptible to getting infected with malware that specializes in looking for cryptocurrency wallets, Percoco says.

Software wallets can be useful if you spend cryptocurrency often, he says. In that case, you may want to have a software wallet that you transfer cryptocurrency to once a month from a hardware wallet. That said, “your life savings shouldn’t be available on your computer,” he cautions.

The Electrum desktop wallet is relatively easy to use. And, partly because it has been around since 2011, Electrum is one of the most well-respected desktop wallets out there.

A downside to Electrum is that it can only be used for bitcoin transactions.

For a multicurrency wallet, Chen points to an offering from Jaxx. As ease of use goes, he likes that it allows users to regenerate private keys from a phrase of “seed” words.

Web-Based Wallet: Guarda

Once you give up your private key, you lose your ability to control your cryptocurrency to another party. This is why Chen recommends staying away from web-based wallets that don’t allow users to store their own private keys.

For a noncustodial wallet in which users control their own keys, Guarda offers a web-based multicurrency wallet.

Dhaliwal says Guarda is very secure and praises its simple user interface.

The wallet supports multiple popular coins and tokens. It also allows users to import and export private keys to and from other services, back up a wallet with a secure encryption algorithm and purchase cryptocurrencies with fiat currency.

According to Dhaliwal, Guarda “is the only noncustodial wallet with fiat on- and off-ramps for smooth entry into bitcoin purchases.”

A proposed amendment published over a week ago will require virtual currency service providers to register with the Bank of Spain. If enacted, the law will place Spain in compliance with the EU’s 5th Anti Money-Laundering Directive (AMLD5), the bloc-wide mandate introduced in 2018, to strengthen preventative measures against financial crime.

To get things moving even faster, the public comment period on the amendment ends today; typically, the comment period is 60 to 90 days.

EU member nations had 18 months to comply with the new directive. In February, it sent warning letters to eight countries, including Spain, urging them to get moving on amending their AML laws.

Mariana Gospodinova, general manager of virtual currency platform Crypto.com’s Europe operations, told CoinDesk the understanding of digital аssets has evolved greatly since the AMLD55 was first published. The abundance of new information, some of which came directly from companies seeking to be regulated in certain jurisdictions, led to a steep learning curve. This has helped regulators understand the risks associated with crypto, and offer comprehensive amendments that will improve risk mitigation and management, she said.

“States may have benefited from a further extension of the implementation period and each country may have had their own reasoning as to why [there were] delays – from political circumstances to [a] lack of resource[s] to comply within the period given,” Gospodinova told CoinDesk via email.

Under Spain’s new law, crypto-to-fiat exchanges, crypto exchanges, e-wallet providers and those who have custody of customers’ private keys will be subject to national regulation and registration.

A transitional provision calls for all these entities to register their services with the Bank of Spain within nine months from the enactment of the law.

“The Draft Law advances in the reinforcement of the money laundering and terrorist financing control system, incorporating the new community provisions and including additional improvements in the current regulation to increase the effectiveness of prevention mechanisms,” the government website said.

Although the EU provides direction, it is ultimately the decision of each member nation’s regulator to provide details on how it will deal with entities that are not conforming to local crypto rules and regulations, Gospodinova said.

Another nation told to speed up compliance with EU law was the Netherlands, which took drastic measures to speed up the process and later faced criticism over how the new laws were implemented.

Although the United Kingdom left the EU at the end of January this year, it transposed the new AML laws before its exit. Gospodinova said the United Kingdom’s financial authority, FCA, is diligently monitoring crypto firms servicing its residents and publishing warnings on its frequently updated website clarifying risks associated with engaging in activities not licensed by regulators.

In EU countries that have already complied with AMLD5, crypto firms, especially smaller companies, have complained about the added costs of compliance, which may drive them out of the country.

The EU directive also outlines stringent know-your-customer (KYC) regulations that reinforce the law introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international financial crimes watchdog: the travel rule.

“At the moment, crypto transactions are still unidentified in terms of ownership while they remain transparent in terms of movement. The anonymity of blockchain transactions will change with the implementation of the FATF travel rule, which aims to identify the sender and recipient of all crypto transactions,” Gospodinova said.

According to the document published by the Spanish government, the reinforcement of an identification system is among the proposed amendments, stating, “In no case shall the obligated subjects maintain business relationships or carry out operations with individuals or legal entities that have not been duly identified.”",2020-06-23 19:36:30+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/69291/crypto-data-platform-coingecko-introduces-reward-system-for-users,"Crypto market data aggregator CoinGecko has launched a new reward system for its users.

The net flow of coins into or out of miner addresses fell to -2,935 BTC on Tuesday to hit the lowest level since June 2019, according to data source Glassnode. To put it another way, miner wallets witnessed the highest outflow of coins for a year.

Source: Glassnode

“There has been a big spike in miner outflows overnight, I’m expecting a whole lot of selling, starting real soon,” popular cryptocurrency analyst Cole Garner tweeted, along with a chart from blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant showing a big spike in the miner outflow around 10:00 UTC on Tuesday.

However, the Miner’s Netflow Volume does not tell us whether coins have been sent to exchanges for liquidation or sold off in an over-the-counter deal.

However, another metric, which tracks the flow of coins from miner wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges, shows nearly 97% of the total outflow of 2,935 BTC from miner addresses was deposited to cryptocurrency exchanges on Tuesday.

Bitcoin: Miners to Exchanges Source: Glassnode

The total 2,844 BTC that went to exchange platforms was the highest since March 26. That’s a major spike: on Monday, only 404 BTC were deposited on exchanges.

With the sudden rise in the number of coins available on exchanges for liquidation, the cryptocurrency looks vulnerable for a notable price drop. Such spikes in miner outflows have preceded price drops in the past, although they don’t necessarily mean a drop is on the way.

For example, outflows increased from 380 BTC to 1,824 BTC on Aug. 2, 2019, but the cryptocurrency extended its recovery rally to hit highs above $12,300 on Aug. 6.

It remains to be seen if the latest spike in miner outflows yields a notable price drop or traps bears on the wrong side of the market. Supporting the case for a downside move is the fact that miners have spent less than they mined in the last 24 hours, pushing miners’ rolling inventory (MRI) above 100%, according to ByteTree.com.

Miners typically hoard coins when they feel the market lacks strength to absorb their offers.

Register here .

New York’s financial regulator on Wednesday proposed new licensing rules that would make it easier for companies to engage in cryptocurrency business — using such digital currencies as bitcoin — in the state.

The New York State Department of Financial Services is asking for the public’s input about the plan by Aug. 10. The initiative stems from the “actual or perceived hurdles” that firms may face in obtaining the state’s “BitLicense,” unveiled in 2015, the regulator said.

New York’s proposed framework would allow companies that want to engage in virtual currency business activity in the state to obtain a conditional license, through which they would collaborate with fully licensed companies, NYDFS said.

New York introduced its BitLicense and initial framework in 2015, when other regulators were still skeptical of virtual currencies. Those currencies are now part of a broader, rapidly growing industry that blends finance and technology, and which leading financial centers are keen to attract.

But obtaining New York’s current BitLicense can be a years-long process, virtual currency companies have said.

The state has granted 25 virtual currency licenses and charters since 2015, NYDFS said.

The regulator on Wednesday also made it easier for companies to offer and use new coins. The regulator will provide a list of pre-approved coins from which licensees can select and then self-certify they are using without having to get additional approval.",2020-06-24 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/someone-has-been-on-a-200m-crypto-exchange-hacking-spree,"A cybercriminal group has allegedly stolen around $200 million from cryptocurrency exchanges over the past two years. In total, they are believed to have hit 10 - 20 victims across the United States, the Middle East, and Asia.

According to research by the cybersecurity firm ClearSky, the gang named “CryptoCore,” known with other pseudonyms like “Dangerous Password” and “Leery Turtle,” has been actively targeting crypto firms since 2018 — specifically exchanges.

Source: ClearSky

They confirmed that CryptoCore stole $200 million from at least five victims, several of whom were located in Japan.

Between 10-20 additional companies could be affected

The names of targeted crypto exchanges were not revealed due to non-disclosure agreements with the victims. It is believed that the total number of targets could be as high as 20 in total.

The cybersecurity firm believes CryptoCore may have links to the Eastern European region, Ukraine, Russia, or Romania.

Phishing attacks launched against the exchanges

The hackers used spear-phishing attacks to gain access to crypto exchanges’ wallets. In some cases, they may have targeted executives’ personal email accounts.

The report details that spear-phishing attacks are “typically” carried out by impersonating employees, mostly those who have a high-ranking role within the company or from another organization like the advisory board.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Brett Callow, threat analyst at malware lab Emsisoft, provided some comments regarding spear-phishing attacks like CryptoCore did:

“Some phishing campaigns consist of non-targeted mass emails sent to a large number of people. Others, however, are crafted to target specific individuals - a company executive, for example. This known as spear phishing and, because the actor may have spent time collecting information about the individual being targeted, the emails can be extremely convincing.”

Callow also adds:

“Many security incidents and data breaches start with phishing emails. Phishing campaigns are typically designed to either collect logins - for example, by directing the recipient to a fake banking site - or to deliver malware via malicious attachments. In either case, the end result can be the same: a compromised network.”

CryptoCore is not the only headache for the exchanges

North Korean hacking team, Lazarus Group, targeted several crypto exchanges last year, as per a Chainalysis report. One of the attacks involved the creation of a fake, but realistic trading bot website that was offered to employees of the DragonEx exchange.

Recently, Cointelegraph reported on a study that warned of a massive phishing campaign that could be launched by Lazarus soon. This could allegedly target six nations and over 5 million businesses and individuals.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-options-market-faces-record-1-billion-expiry-on-friday,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) derivatives continue to grow despite light spot trading over the past two months. The cryptocurrency’s options market is on its way to a record $1 billion monthly expiry this Friday.

At press time, there are 114,700 option contracts (notional value of over $1 billion) set to expire on June 26 across major exchanges – Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX – according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Options open interest by expiry Source: Skew

Options are derivative contracts that give buyers the right but not obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and the put option represents the right to sell. With options, traders can make bullish or bearish bets on contracts at various price levels called strikes that expire in different months.

“This is definitely the largest BTC option expiry by a country mile,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5.

Meanwhile, Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh said that “with big quarterly expiry, you tend to see some pinning and then the market moving post-expiry.”

Option expiries can influence market direction via a process known as “pinning” in which option traders try to move the spot price to avoid sharp losses.

Holders who benefit from higher prices in the underlying asset – put sellers and call buyers – often take long positions in the spot market to raise prices before the expiration date. On the other hand, put buyers and call sellers, who benefit from a drop in the underlying asset, take short positions in the spot market to keep prices under pressure ahead of expiry.

The tug of war often leads to prices being pinned at or near the strike price where a large number of open positions are concentrated. “Depending on where the open interest [open positions] is scattered, you could be in the game to pin strikes,” Shah told CoinDesk, and added further that, “the bulk of distribution of OI [open interest] in general is skewed slightly higher.”

Options open interest by strike Source: Skew

Indeed, open interest is concentrated at $10,000 and $11,000 strike prices. Meanwhile, on the downside, notable open interest buildup is seen at $9,000 strike.

According to Pankaj Balani, CEO and founder of Singapore-based Delta Exchange, traders have sold a good amount of calls around $10,000-$11,000 strikes for the June expiry.

As a result, $10,000 may act as a stiff resistance heading into expiry. If prices begin to rise, call sellers may take short positions in the spot markets in order to keep the cryptocurrency from scaling the $10,000 mark.

At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $9,400, representing a 2.5% decline on the day. The cryptocurrency has traded largely in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 ever since its third reward halving, which took place on May 11.

Post-expiry volatility?

Bitcoin may become vulnerable to violent price moves over the coming months if traders rollover short positions in June contracts to July and September expiry.

A rollover refers to squaring off positions in contracts nearing expiry and replicating the same position in the next-nearest expiry.

As noted earlier, there has been significant call writing (selling) at $10,000 and $11,000 strike prices. Alpha5’s Vishal Shah says there is risk in transporting short positions to July or September expiry as bitcoin options are at a very low level of implied volatility historically.

This is definitely the largest BTC option expiry by a country mile.

The three-month implied volatility is hovering below its lifetime average of 96.6% on an annualized basis, according to data source Skew. A prolonged period of low volatility consolidation, similar to the one seen over the past two months, often paves the way for a big move in either direction.

Thus, if traders rollover short positions, they face risk of an impending rise in volatility that would make options costlier. That, in turn, would lead to more chaotic trading and further rise in volatility.

“If the current options structures [short position] are replicated into July and September expiries, traders would run into a potential situation of having ‘sold too low’ in terms of volatility. That can bring in all types of complications, and lead to some disorderly behavior if and when the spot picks up directionality,” said Shah.

Volatility has a positive impact on option prices. The higher the volatility (uncertainty), the stronger is the hedging demand for options. Seasoned traders often sell options when volatility is well above its lifetime average and buy options when volatility is too low.

Options expiry a non-event?

Some analysts say bitcoin’s options market is too small to have any meaningful impact on the cryptocurrencies price.

“Options expiry is unlikely to have an influence on price action in comparison to the impact of futures expiry, said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder, and co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR. “But we expect options volumes to continue growing, options could end up having a bigger impact in the long term.”

Indeed, global option volumes are only 1% of total futures and swap volumes, analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Luno noted in its weekly report. Meanwhile, there is a sizable open interest of 4,605 contracts ($214 million at current price) in CME futures expiring in June, which is yet to be rolled over the July contracts, as noted by Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company.

“If these are residual longs from the reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage that was available in March and are covered with spot buying into the expiry, we will have opposing forces at play, which will further add to price volatility,” Balani told CoinDesk.

Reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy, wherein a trader takes a sell position in the spot market and a long position in the futures market. This strategy is implemented when futures trade at a notable discount to spot price. For instance, following the March crash, futures were trading at nearly a 4% discount to the spot price.

Back then, traders may have bought futures and sold BTC in the spot market, thereby locking a 4% riskless return. This is because futures converge with the spot price on the day of expiry.",2020-06-24 16:57:29+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/analytics-firms-bitcoin-atm-linked-money-laundering,"As the number of bitcoin ATMs soars, one crypto analytics firm suggests they are increasingly being used to sidestep anti-money laundering (AML) controls.

In its Spring report, published earlier this month, analytics company CipherTrace found bitcoin ATMs were frequently used to send funds to “high-risk exchanges” – trading platforms the company considers to be known for facilitating criminal activity and money laundering.

“The percentage of funds sent to high-risk exchanges from U.S. BATMs [bitcoin ATMs] has seen exponential growth, doubling every year since 2017.” the report reads. While approximately 2% of U.S. transactions went to high-risk exchanges in 2017, that number is now knocking at the 8% mark.

While they may somewhat resemble a cash-based machine, a bitcoin ATM enables people to buy and sell bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies directly from an exchange, using bank cards or even hard cash. Crucially, users don’t need to have a digital wallet: The machines create them, providing users with printouts of the wallet addresses and private keys.

CipherTrace also highlighted that the vast majority of U.S. bitcoin ATM transactions in 2019, around 88%, sent funds to offshore destinations.

“[B]itcoin ATMs are likely to be the next major regulatory target,” the report predicts.

This coincides with an explosion in the number of new bitcoin ATMs coming to market. Globally, there are roughly 60% more installed now than there were this time last year, according to Coin ATM Radar. The current figure of over 8,300 machines is up from around 5,000 in June 2019.

What’s also interesting is the rate of installations has doubled since the start of 2020. While around 1,000 more were added between June and December 2019, in the past six months or so another 2,000 new ATMs have gone online.

Since March alone, more than 1,000 new ATMs have been installed. Around about a 100 more have come online in the last week alone. Roughly 6,200 – two-thirds – of total units are in the U.S., according to Coin ATM Radar.

As recently as Monday, bitcoin ATM operator LibertyX said users would also be able to purchase bitcoin from over 20,000 retail locations across the U.S., including from the 7-Eleven convenience chain.

Bitcoin ATM operators insist they are doing all they can to follow regulations. ATM services in the U.S. must sign up with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service business and are supposed to keep records of their transactions, follow know-your-customer (KYC) protocols and report anything suspicious to the authorities.

LibertyX co-founder and CEO Chris Yim said customers had to complete various KYC checks on their app before they could use the terminals. The ATMs also require the user provide a wallet address and a verified purchase location before the bitcoin is even sent.

Coinsource, which owns and operates just under 500 such ATMs across the U.S., has also emphasized its commitment to ensuring it has all the right protections in place.

“Compliance is key. Once we learned how important compliance was … we obviously invested heavily in building our AML and KYC program and then staffing it correctly with experts that could support us in the venture,” said CEO Sheffield Clark in late 2018.

But there are still some that don’t comply. Back in August 2019, a 25-year-old bitcoin trader in Los Angeles pleaded guilty for not registering his bitcoin ATM business with FinCEN and for laundering up to $25 million-worth of funds for criminals, including drug dealers.

Bitcoin ATMs are likely to be the next major regulatory target.

Also last year, police in Spain reported a local criminal gang involved in the international narcotics trade had effectively bypassed European AML controls by laundering cash through two bitcoin ATMs and use the “clean” crypto to pay suppliers in Columbia.

Speaking to CoinDesk, Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at analytics company Elliptic, said the passing of FATF guidance dubbed the “Travel Rule” last year means that stronger AML/KYC requirements for crypto businesses are now being implemented around the world.

Elliptic is working with many bitcoin ATM operators who have concerns their terminals are being used for money laundering, Robinson said. And while regulation is gradually being implemented, he still has concerns about how well some of this will apply to bitcoin ATMs.

“The situation is certainly improving, but it will take time to ensure that these measures are applied globally,” he said.

For LibertyX’s Yim, bitcoin ATM operators still have to make a choice on how closely they want to protect user privacy while remaining regulatory compliant.

“What I see is a risk spectrum across competitive markets,” according to Yim, “some BTM operators are okay with the potential increased regulatory scrutiny.”",2020-06-24 16:24:31+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/kpmg-cryptocurrency-platform/,"KPMG Introduces Cryptocurrency Management Platform

KPMG has launched a cryptocurrency management platform designed to accelerate institutional crypto adoption. KPMG’s patent-pending tool aims to bridge traditional data and crypto systems, integrating key use cases of cryptocurrency, including custody, wallets, and anti-money laundering (AML) transaction monitoring.

KPMG’s Crypto Suite

KPMG LLP announced on Monday that it has launched a “New platform [that] addresses global regulatory concerns for strong system controls and processes for crypto and digital assets.” Called KPMG Chain Fusion, the new cryptocurrency platform aims “to help manage crypto and traditional assets over public and private blockchain networks,” the announcement details. KPMG LLP is the U.S. member firm of KPMG International, one of the Big Four accounting firms, which has more than 219,000 professionals working in 147 countries and territories.

The firm described this product as “a patent-pending suite of advanced analytics capabilities built on leading cryptoasset data and technology products to streamline the ability for financial services companies and fintechs to offer cryptoasset services on an institutional scale,” adding:

KPMG Chain Fusion is designed to accelerate trusted adoption of core cryptoasset capabilities through a consistent data architecture.

The new cryptocurrency platform “enables advanced analytics” for key use cases of cryptocurrency, including custody, wallets, “proof of reserves (asset position reconciliation), and AML transaction monitoring,” the firm outlined.

While many financial service institutions and fintech firms are already offering crypto services, KPMG emphasized that an increased number of traditional businesses are now offering crypto services on “both public, permissionless and permissioned blockchains.” The firm’s website elaborates:

The operation of a successful cryptoasset business at institutional scale hinges on the ability to efficiently and effectively integrate blockchain data alongside traditional data infrastructure.

Sam Wyner, director of the KPMG Cryptoasset Services team, noted that while leading crypto technology solutions “can address process and control requirements within their own systems, the greater challenge is making sure systems can work together.” That’s where the firm’s new crypto management platform comes in. According to Wyner, “KPMG Chain Fusion addresses those challenges by bringing these systems together with the required processes and controls under one roof.”

The idea bitcoin might be some sort of new, stable asset has been gaining followers; most of the time it’s tied to the idea that bitcoin is a new form of “digital gold.”

The “Black Thursday” crash in mid March led all asset classes to move together, temporarily spiking correlations. But some argue that the correlation between gold and bitcoin has stayed particularly strong months after the crash.

“The correlation between gold [and bitcoin] has consistently maintained relatively high levels for several months now, a phenomenon that has not been historically observed,” data provider Coin Metrics said in its June report.

Analysts suggested the market might be treating both bitcoin and gold as safe-haven assets during unprecedented market disruption and volatility.

But not everyone agrees with the digital gold narrative. Most notably, in a note to investors earlier this month, U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said bitcoin still remains a “vehicle of speculation” and rejected the idea it was becoming a new type of macro hedge.

In recent months, the relationship between bitcoin and the stock market has “moved sharply higher,” analysts said. “There is little evidence that bitcoin and others served as a safe haven (i.e., ‘digital gold’) – rather, its value appears to have been highly correlated with risky assets like equities.”

Coin Metrics shows the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 – the world’s leading stock index – remained “very weak” at around 0.17, while that with gold came in at -0.07, a converse relationship that is virtually non-existent.

However, data from CoinDesk indicates that, on a shorter 60-day rolling average, the relationship between the stocks and bitcoin was consistently stronger than that with the precious metal.

As the graph below shows, the correlation between the S&P 500 and bitcoin has floated around 0.30 for most of June.

In contrast, that between gold and bitcoin was in at just over 0.2, having fluctuated between a 0.15 trough and 0.45 peak across June.

“We have seen a relatively steady increase in the S&P 500 index in the past couple of months which correlated with BTC’s trading range-bound around $8,600-$10,000,” said Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of price aggregator site CoinGecko, in an email.

This connection might help explain why the bitcoin price has stayed relatively stable and unaffected by industry-centric developments.

The halving event in mid-May, which slashed block rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, increased scarcity and was widely expected to drive prices higher – or, at least, increase volatility.

But that didn’t happen. On the contrary, bitcoin’s price has stayed flat and volatility fell to an eight-month low, earlier this week.

Bitcoin barely budged 1% on the news PayPal might be rolling out direct sales of cryptocurrency to its more than 325 million users worldwide.

“Movements in the S&P 500 will play a major role in BTC price movement so changes in macroeconomic conditions is something we should keep an eye on,” Ong said. “I think BTC price may correlate with the stock market for the foreseeable future.”

While the 0.30 correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 is still relatively weak, it’s still stronger and more consistent than with gold.

Should the stock market rally continue, and bitcoin continue to track it, the original cryptocurrency could even be looking to break out of its established price range.

However, as on Black Thursday, concerns around the global effects of the coronavirus and the ensuing economic turmoil could potentially also send both stocks and bitcoin tumbling once more.

BTC: Price: $9,381 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,699 | 24-Hr Low: $9,338

Trend: Bitcoin is facing selling pressure on Wednesday despite a key indicator eyeing a bullish shift.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $9,400 at press time, a -2.6% decline on the day, having faced rejection at $9,800 on Monday.

However, the 100-day moving average (MA) of bitcoin’s price is on track to cross above the 200-day MA in the next 24 hours or so. The resulting bull cross of the two averages would be the first since early April.

The cross comes on the heels of a so-called golden crossover of the 50- and 200-day MAs seen a month ago. Bullish MA crossovers are widely followed and often invite stronger chart driven buyers. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has failed to pick up a strong bid.

On-chain developments, too, have been calling for an extended move higher for some time. For instance, the number of bitcoin “whales,” or entities holding at least 1,000 BTC, recently rose to 1,844. That’s the highest level since November 2017, suggesting continued buying pressure from wealthy investors.

Even so, bitcoin remains trapped in the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000. Moreover, the consolidation has gone far too long despite bullish technical and fundamental developments, and the bears may feel emboldened in the absence of quick progress to the higher side.

The immediate support is seen at $9,000, which, if breached, would expose the 200-day MA located at $8,291. On the higher side, $10,000 is still the resistance to beat for the bulls.",2020-06-24 12:37:22+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/69453/australia-crypto-scam-losses-2019,"Australians lost over AU$21 million (roughly $14.5 million) last year to cryptocurrency investment scams, according to a government report.



According to the report, published on Monday by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), most of the scams took the form of Ponzi schemes with no real cryptocurrency involved. Cloud mining — which involves the sale of blockchain network hashing power to would-be investors – constituted a common adaptation of this type of fraud.

The losses, outlined across 1810 reports, are four times more than those reported in 2018. A number of reports were made by younger Australians between the ages of 25 to 34.

""Scammers are shifting to more modern payment methods, which are often harder to trace than traditional ones. The anonymity of unregulated cryptocurrencies and other real-time payment channels impedes the ability to recover funds or identify scammers. While most people are still using bank payments, Bitcoin and other payment methods now make up the top three ways scammers receive money,"" the ACCC said in its report.

Binance expects to offer trading on as many as 65 digital tokens at launch later this summer, with the platform regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.

The platform differs from the crypto exchange that Binance currently operates in the UK in offering direct currency trading using pounds and euros. Users will be able to convert from fiat to cryptocurrency using the UK Faster Payments Service and the Single Euro Payments Area network. In addition, Binance plans to enable customers to open virtual bank accounts that are tied to the cryptocurrency trading network.

For Binance, the launch is a way to take advantage of cryptocurrency’s growing popularity among institutional investors.

“As crypto services mature and evolve, we’re able to create new options to engage and capture interest from a wider audience with varying risk appetites,” Binance UK Director Teana Baker-Taylor said of the news.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed charges, alleging the AML Bitcoin team violated federal securities laws.

Andrade told CoinDesk late on Thursday he was not guilty of the charges, claiming the allegations were “retaliation” for his opposition to a previous case.

According to Bloomberg, Abramoff will plead guilty and pay more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest.

“In [its] White Paper, the NAC Foundation claimed AML Bitcoin cryptocurrency would include features that would allow the cryptocurrency to comply with anti-money laundering (also referred to as ‘AML’) and know-your-customer (‘KYC’) regulations and laws by using ‘biometric technologies’ among other methods to confirming the identities of participants in transactions using AML Bitcoin,” the DOJ filing said.

According to a 2018 press release, NAC Foundation claimed AML Bitcoin was “the world’s only patent-pending digital currency with anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, anti-terrorism and theft-resistant properties.”

The DOJ filing was first shared by Seamus Hughes, George Washington University deputy director, Program on Extremism.

Andrade tried to raise up to $100 million during the ICO, which occurred in late 2017 and early 2018, the filing claimed. According to the SEC complaint, Andrade raised about $5.6 million from 2,400 investors.

According to the DOJ filing, Andrade and unnamed colleagues “made public statements and statements to potential purchasers” that “misrepresented the state of the development” of the project., created a fake “rejection campaign,” made statements indicating the NAC Foundation was close to working with government agencies and “misappropriated money obtained through the sale of AML Bitcoin.”

The fake rejection campaign centered around the National Football League, the DOJ filing said.

“Andrade, NAC Foundation and his associates claimed that the advertisement would have aired during the Super Bowl if the television network airing the Super Bowl and the National Football League had not rejected the advertisement as being too controversial,” the filing alleged. “In fact, the NAC Foundation did not have the funds to purchase the advertising time, and the advertisement was never reviewed or rejected by the network or the NFL.”

According to the DOJ, Andrade also claimed to have substantive meetings with the government of Panama and an elected official in California. The filing alleged the Panama claims were “overstated,” and while “Andrade was present at a roundtable discussion and had his photograph taken with the [California] official,” AML Bitcoin “was not discussed.”

Close to $1 million was spent on a new home and real estate, the DOJ filing alleged.

According to a March filing, U.S. officials have also filed to seize “one parcel of real property” owned at least in part by Andrade and his wife.

This filing details how an individual, dubbed “VICTIM ONE,” invested $1 million in the AML Bitcoin project, but transferred the funds into a JPMorgan Chase account held by “J.D.,” an associate of Andrade. The funds were then allegedly transferred to a third party “who acted at the direction of Andrade” at JPMorgan; then to an account belonging to “NAC Payroll Services Inc.”; then to an account at Wells Fargo owned by Andrade; then to a personal account at Woodforest National Bank. Andrade claims he did not personally convince the victim to invest in the project.

The March filing alleges that these funds wre then used to purchase a residence from a Texas homebuilding firm.

“To date, Andrade and the NAC have not made any meaningful progress towards developing AtenCoin, AML Bitcoin, or ABTC,” the filing said, referring to two other names affiliated with AML Bitcoin.

Futures trading activity hit an all-year low Sunday after slumping to just $5 billion.

Options activity may have hit a high at $226 million on June 2, but activity has still gone south. Volume came in at around $80 million June 23, down nearly 62% from its peak.

Derivative trading volumes usually increase during periods of pronounced volatility. On March 12, when the bitcoin price fell by nearly 40%, daily volumes clocked a record $45 billion.

A fall in trading volumes could, therefore, be down to the fact bitcoin has been pretty dull recently.

Prices have stuck to a narrow $9,000 to $10,000 range since May 11; bitcoin has so far failed to hold its own above the crucial $10,000 threshold.

Bitcoin’s volatility hit an eight-month low earlier this week.

But while the number of settled contracts remains at a yearly low, open interest – the number of contracts that have yet to settle – remains high.

Open interest in futures came to $3.8 billion, on June 23, up 50% from $2.5 billion from the start of May. On CME, open interest has risen by a staggering 1,145% since the halving, hitting a record of $436 million on June 23.

In options, total open interest has consistently hit new highs almost every day for the past four weeks. At $1.1 billion on May 23, it hit $1.7 billion on Tuesday.

Investors may be adding bets to position for a big move in either direction, which is often seen following a prolonged consolidation.

In traditional markets, options traders often take “straddles,” a non-directional strategy comprises buying both calls (bullish bets) and puts (bearish bets). That could be the reason for the recent rise in the open interest in options.

While options markets are still new in crypto, it might be that the same thing is happening here. The uptick in open interest indicates that the market is betting on a breakout – whether that’s up or down still hasn’t been decided yet.

BTC: Price: $9,226 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,421 | 24-Hr Low: $9,002

Trend: Bitcoin defended key support early Thursday, keeping the immediate neutral bias intact.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market value absorbed selling pressure around $9,000 and is now trading largely unchanged on the day near $9,270, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price.

The price bounce has saved the day for the bulls, as acceptance below $9,000 would have meant a downside break of the multi-week long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000. A range breakdown often invites stronger selling pressure, leading to deeper losses. In bitcoin’s case, it would have opened the doors for a decline to the 200-day moving average (MA) at $8,300.

While the cryptocurrency has staged an impressive recovery from crucial support, the bias remains neutral, as resistance at $10,000 is intact. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times over the past five months to establish a strong foothold above that level.

That level, however, could come into play if the global equity markets reverse losses seen on Wednesday. At press time, the futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.40% decline.

The trust, named ETHE, hit an $82.5 monthly bottom this week, representing a 65% decline from the $239 year-to-date high around June 4. The current share price sits around $98.

Its premium — relative to the spot price of the underlying asset, ETH — plunged from 948% in early June to 356% as of the time of writing.

The price and premium declines came on the heel of a large amount of ETHE shares becoming available for trading on the secondary market. Grayscale's Ethereum trust fund is structured such that shares are subject to a one-year lockup period before they can be freely traded.

From May 31 to July 1 of last year, the Ethereum trust's total asset under management surged from $12.69 million to $28.6 million. Given that each ETHE share represents around 0.1 ETH and ETH price during that time rose from $267 to $293, the total number of ETHE shares more than doubled during that month, jumping from around 475,281 shares to 976,109. This means that over 500,000 ETHE shares will be released by the end of June 2020.

Some people believe that the mechanics of crypto trading are similar to trading fiat currencies like the US dollar or the British pound.

But although there are some undeniable areas of overlap, there are plenty of areas where cryptocurrency trading differs from conventional foreign exchange trading too. Let us take a closer look.

Where crypto trading differs from trading forex

• Cryptocurrencies can be traded 24/7

Unlike the foreign exchange markets, which are only accessible 24 hours a day, five days a week, cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7. There is always an opportunity to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, regardless of which cryptocurrency exchange you use. Think of cryptos as a byproduct of today’s digital society. Just like the always-on, always-connected digital world, cryptocurrency price moves wait for no-one.

• Forex liquidity is still much greater than the likes of Bitcoin

The Daily Hodl’s report into forex and crypto trading found that forex liquidity is still far greater than even the biggest crypto assets like Bitcoin. In 2016, some $5 trillion of US dollars were traded daily in the forex markets. Compare that with just $1 billion in the Bitcoin markets and it’s easy to see that cashflow still reigns supreme in the traditional forex markets – for now.

• Cryptos tend to be much more volatile than flat currencies

As cryptocurrency markets are much, much newer than conventional forex markets, they tend to be considerably more volatile. With little history to go by, the markets can fluctuate enormously in the space of 24 hours based on economic or political news. For instance, the price of Bitcoin crashed by 20% in under an hour, back in March.

Similarities of crypto and forex trading

• Both markets are driven by supply and demand

One attribute that’s similar in both the crypto and forex markets is that price activity is driven largely by supply and demand. When there is heightened demand for Bitcoin or the US dollar, its price will go up and, similarly, it will fall when supply exceeds demand.

• Both types of trading can be automated

There is software that can be used to automate the execution of trades in both the forex and crypto markets. This software can automatically set entry and exit points in the market, as well as stop-loss points, to ensure that you manage your risk. A popular crypto trading robot is one that was said to be backed by Peter Jones Bitcoin Trader, which yields daily returns of as much as 400%.

• Risk management is vital to be profitable in both markets

It’s impossible to know which way the cryptocurrency and forex markets will move with each trade you open. That’s why both forms of trading require rock-solid risk management to maintain profitability. You may have sound fundamental and technical analysis awareness but, without stop losses to protect your positions, you could face losses far greater than your losses if the markets don’t move the way you expect them to.

Put simply, there are pros and cons of trading either market. Given that crypto trading is more volatile than forex, it’s possible that you could trade both simultaneously, with the slower-paced forex markets offering lower-risk opportunities and cryptos giving you a chance to generate those higher returns.",2020-06-25 11:00:00+00:00,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/06/25/finra-suspends-ex-wells-fargo-rep-over-crypto-concealment/,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority suspended an ex-Wells Fargo broker from association with any FINRA member in any capacity for 18 months after he allegedly engaged in outside business activities involving cryptocurrency investments without notifying Wells Fargo and then provided false information to the wirehouse to conceal his actions, according to FINRA.

Though the actual identity of the hacking group is not known, a report published by the cybersecurity firm on Wednesday, detailed that it is clear from the profile, modus operandi, and digital infrastructure of the attacks that it was the single group.

“CryptoCore is a group that targets almost exclusively cryptocurrency exchanges and companies working with them via supply-chain attack,” ClearSky noted. “The CryptoCore group is known for having accumulated a sum of approximately 70 million USD from its heists on exchanges. We estimate that the group managed to rake in more than 200 million USD in two years.”

Though the Israeli firm is calling the group CryptoCore, other security companies also traced the whereabouts of the same group, one firm named it “Leery Turtle.”

Small, yet efficient

Based on the timestamp of the first known sample of such attacks, the hackers started their operations in mid-2018 and “maintained steady activity since then.” The security company, however, could not pinpoint the exact location or country of origin of the group.

“We assess with [a] medium level of certainty that the threat actor has links to the East European region, Ukraine, Russia or Romania in particular,” ClearSky continued.

The hacker group is believed to have maybe three to four people, but they are very effective.

“This group is not extremely technically advanced, yet it seems to be swift, persistent, and effective, nevertheless,” the report added.

They are particularly targeting cryptocurrency exchange wallets in the United States and Japan.

“While the group’s key infiltration vector to the exchange is usually through spear-phishing against the corporate network, the executives’ personal email accounts are the first to be targeted,” ClearSky detailed.

“Infiltrating the personal email accounts is an optional phase; however, it’s a matter of hours to weeks until the spear-phishing email is sent to a corporate email account of an exchange’s executive.”",2020-06-25 08:36:08+00:00

However, that bullish theory, which suggests the cryptocurrency would be viewed as a hedge asset in dire economic times, has been dealt a blow by recent data from the U.S. central bank.

The data suggests inflation is likely to remain absent for some time and, in fact, the probability of the U.S. economy slipping into deflation is rising.

There’s now a 78.6% chance of deflationary pressure for the U.S – the highest since 2008, according to St. Louis Fed’s deflation risk monitor. As tweeted by Ritvik Carvalho, a financial data correspondent at Reuters, the Fed’s favored inflation measure (below right) – the core personal consumption expenditure – has also declined to an eight-year low of 1%.

Inflation refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services. Its opposite, deflation is characterized by a general decline in prices for goods and services, and is typically accompanied by a rise in unemployment.

Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in early March the Fed has injected an unprecedented amount of liquidity into the system to help the economy absorb shocks arising from the virus outbreak and ensure financial market stability. Its balance sheet size has expanded by over $3 trillion over the past 3.5 months.

Crypto analysts are convinced that the massive money injections would boost inflation and bode well for bitcoin. That’s in part based on the cryptocurrency’s reducing pace of supply, which drops by 50% every four years via a process called the “halving.”

“As we’ve closely monitored the market in the wake of recent economic policy decisions, we’ve seen that the crypto asset class is not only resilient, but that interest is surging as the monetary stimulus has caused investors to look to $BTC as a potential hedge against inflation,” Grayscale Investments, one of the leading digital asset management companies, recently tweeted. (Grayscale is a unit of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.)

Legendary fund manager Paul Tudor Jones also recently disclosed a small bitcoin position to help protect against a rise in inflation.

But with the Fed data and market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations also suggesting a low chance of a rise in inflation over the next five years, the odds of bitcoin witnessing an inflation-driven bull market look weak.

So if the U.S. is, in fact, facing deflation, what does it mean for bitcoin?

Some observers suggest the cryptocurrency would appreciate in a deflationary environment – if its adoption as a medium of exchange rises, as discussed in April. This is because deflation boosts the purchasing power of the monetary unit. For this reason, the U.S. dollar tends to appreciate during deflationary bouts.

There’s also evidence institutional participation in the bitcoin market is increasing. As a result, some of the increasing money supply may find its way into the bitcoin market. In that case, the cryptocurrency could rise in the long term despite low inflation or deflation.

Cryptocurrency markets and bitcoin price stability might be coming to an end soon, as a number of skeptics and speculators expect a big move after today’s options derivatives contracts expire. Bitcoin prices have been less volatile during the last three weeks, but over 114,000 bitcoin options with a notional value over $1 billion set to expire on Friday, June 26, could change that trend.

Traders are eying bitcoin (BTC) derivatives contracts that are set to expire at the end of the trading day. At the time of writing, BTC is swapping for $9,249 per unit and has a $170 billion market valuation. The entire market capitalization of all 5,000+ crypto assets is around $263 billion on Friday morning.

This week, traders and crypto market analysts have been focused on watching the options contracts set to end today. The researchers from Arcane Research recently published a report and discussed the bitcoin options issue.

“Close to $1 billion bitcoin options contracts will expire on Jun 26, accounting for 60% of the total open interest in the BTC options market,” Arcane’s report noted. “In situations like this, there could be significant financial incentives to move the spot price towards a certain level before the expiry date.”

The options expiry of over $1 billion in notional value is the largest expiration of its kind and a number of traders believe that it will trigger a big move. Data from Skew’s analytics show that between Deribit, Bakkt, Okex, CME, and Ledgerx there is well over $1.8 billion in open interest for options.

Deribit is the largest provider of options, while the regulated institutional exchange CME has the second largest number of contracts.

Traders also have noticed a $7-8k-strike price, while a number of other speculators also see a $10-11k-strike price. Most traders believe that the ‘big move’ will end up being in range of either one of these two price trends.

Traders have been discussing the options expiry all week, and have been theorizing on whether or not it will shake crypto markets.

“In case you missed it, $930,000,000 worth of bitcoin options are expiring on Friday – almost 70% of all total open interest. Seems normal,” explained one individual on Twitter.

Another trader called Altcoin Psycho also discussed the big expiry expected today. “Everyone is expecting huge BTC volatility because of options expiry tomorrow, but let’s dig into that,” Altcoin Psycho tweeted to his 35,000 Twitter followers.

“Heaviest volume is for calls at $10k and puts at $9k. The max pain scenario would be bitcoin simply ranging sideways. I think this is what will happen.” “I’ve become a max pain/game theory maximalist as of late,” the trader added.

This week, Grayscale purchased Bitcoin (BTC) about 3x faster, on average, than the cryptocurrency’s miners could actually generate new blocks.

Kevin Rooke, a digital asset analyst who’s well-known for his insightful tweets, confirmed that Grayscale bought 19,879 BTC (appr. $184 million worth) in the past week alone. The digital currency will be part of the asset manager’s Bitcoin Trust. The company now has about 400,000 in Bitcoin, an amount valued at almost $3.7 billion at time of writing.

Rooke noted that Grayscale’s crypto-asset investment strategy not only involves simply acquiring large amounts of the pseudonymous digital currency, but it’s also now purchasing it at a rate that’s about 280% faster than new BTC enters circulation (via mining).

Hodlonaut, a widely-followed Crypto Twitter user, pointed out:

“Grayscale *alone* has taken all BTC mined + 14,000 more BTC off the table since the halving.”

At present, there are over 18.4 million Bitcoins in circulation, however, it’s estimated that around 4 million of this supply has already been lost or is inaccessible due to users losing their private keys (which is the only way to access BTC or crypto accounts).

Grayscale has purchased a total of 53,588 BTC since the halving last month, meaning the asset manager has been buying the crypto-asset at an average rate of 1,190 BTC each day since the halving.

If Grayscale keeps this up, then it’s expected that it will own roughly 3.4% of the total BTC supply (appr. 625,069 BTC) by January of next year. Grayscale might even own around 10% of the Bitcoin supply by 2024, if it continues to buy the asset at this rate.

Barry Silbert had indicated last month that Grayscale’s Bitcoin focused fund would be buying a lot more BTC during Q2 2020.

Grayscale Investments confirmed that it has $4.1 billion in assets under management as of June 25, 2020. However, this amount changes constantly and significantly within weeks or even days, due to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this month, Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a digital asset hedge fund, reportedly became the first qualified investor to hold over 5% of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) shares.

In April 2020, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was trading at a 515% premium.

It had been costing $90.55 to acquire a share in Grayscale Investments’ Ethereum Trust (ETHE). This, despite its Ethereum (ETH) holdings per share being valued at only $16.10 at that time. In other words, it was costing five times more to purchase Ether through the trust than on the open cryptocurrency market.",2020-06-16 00:00:00,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/06/26/sec-charges-lobbyist-jack-abramoff-crypto-firm-and-ceo-with-fraud/,"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday charged the political lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the Nevada-based NAC Foundation and its CEO with defrauding investors by conducting a “fraudulent,” unregistered offering of “AML BitCoin,” a digital asset security the defendants claimed was a new and improved version of Bitcoin.

Abramoff agreed to settle the case and be barred from the securities industry.

In separate complaints filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco — one against Abramoff and the other against NAC and its CEO, Marcus Andrade — the SEC claimed NAC raised at least $5.6 million from more than 2,400 retail investors, mainly in the U.S., by selling tokens that could later be converted to AML (Anti-Money Laundering) BitCoin.

According to the SEC’s complaints, NAC and Andrade portrayed AML BitCoin as superior to the original Bitcoin, offering anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and theft-resistant technology built into the coin on NAC’s own “privately regulated public blockchain.”

In reality, however, none of the capabilities touted by the defendants existed and the development of AML BitCoin and its blockchain technology system was in the very early stages, the SEC alleged.

According to the SEC, Abramoff and Andrade falsely claimed they were on the verge of advertising AML BitCoin during the Super Bowl in an effort to create interest in the offering, despite NAC being unable to afford the cost of the ad.

Super Bowl ads are notoriously expensive, reportedly coming in at more than $5 million for a 30-second spot in each of the past three years.

The defendants also “deceived investors by, among other things, making false and misleading statements in press releases, social media posts, and other promotional materials regarding the status of the technology and governmental agencies’ interest in using AML BitCoin in their payment systems,” according to the SEC. “Many of these false and misleading statements were also disseminated through paid articles that Abramoff arranged and helped write, which purported to be written by independent authors rather than disclosing that they were paid promotions of NAC,” the SEC alleged.

The regulator further alleged that Andrade directed a market manipulation strategy to boost the token’s trading volume and price and diverted about $1.1 million from the offering for his personal use.",2020-06-26 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/eu-bloc-wide-regulatory-regime-crypto-economic-chief,"The European Union is preparing a new cryptocurrency regime that could include stricter requirements for “global stablecoin” projects such as Libra.

The bloc’s lead economics minister, Valdis Dombrovskis – or to give him his full title, the European Union’s Executive Vice President of the European Commission for An Economy that Works for People – said Europe had to seize the opportunity to become one of the main rule-makers for digital finance.

“This is a good chance for Europe to strengthen its international standing and to become a global standard-setter, with European companies leading new technologies for digital finance,” he said during a speech at the Digital Finance Outreach 2020 earlier this week.

And the first test case, Dombrovskis said, would be cryptocurrencies.

Although some cryptos, such as security tokens, are pretty well covered by European law, whole bundles of them, most notably stablecoins, remain entirely unregulated.

“Lack of legal certainty is often cited as the main barrier to developing a sound crypto-asset market in the EU,” Dombrovskis said.

Some EU members have taken matters into their own hands, which damages market integration and makes it difficult for companies to operate across the whole trading bloc.

A new regulatory regime for cryptocurrency will not only cover unregulated digital assets, but it will also consolidate and homogenize existing standards across the continent, Dombrovskis said.

Set to be unveiled later this year, Dombrovskis, who was formerly the prime minister of Latvia, didn’t give much away on what the future regime might look like, although he emphasized that it would support and stimulate innovation.

A pilot scheme would allow regulators to provide a space for new experimental solutions to be monitored and observed, he said.

While Dombrovskis’ speech contained few specifics, he did say that the EU was particularly keen to bring stricter rules on any project deemed to be a “global stablecoin.”

What exactly Dombrovskis means by “global stablecoin” isn’t immediately clear. However, it appears one of the key components is that it’s used instead of traditional fiat currencies and can facilitate a greater number of transactions that cross national borders.

That might be an inference to initiatives such as Facebooks’ Libra. Stablecoins, possibly like Libra, that operate on a global scale can “raise additional challenges,” Dombrovskis said – they can disrupt financial and monetary stability.",2020-06-26 08:00:09+00:00,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/why-cryptocurrency-could-be-a-safe-haven-during-current-health-and-economic-crisis-301084097.html,"PALM BEACH, Florida, June 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Even prior to the arrival of the current world health pandemic, many cryptocurrency believers have been confident in crypto's ability to securely serve as a safe haven… a dependable defense against random chaos. A recent article by an industry insider observer, Cointelegraph.com discussed this, saying: ""With the COVID-19 pandemic rearranging society at every level, the allure of a safe haven reigns supreme for our battered psyches. In the realm of financial instruments, the search for the safest of safe havens, also known as a store of value, has taken on a new urgency. (Are cryptocurrencies that) safe haven? Will cryptocurrency prove to be a store of value above all?"" It continued: ""Safe havens have long played a key role in economics and investing. Traditionally, a safe haven has been an investment in an instrument expected to increase its value during market uncertainty. Safe havens add diversification to portfolios and are crucial investment strategy components for retail players and institutional investors alike. Mentioned in today's commentary includes: Ebang International Holdings (NASDAQ: EBON), Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ: CAN), Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA).

With their deep history in serving humanity's sense of well-being, there is not surprisingly a long list of safe havens that predate Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). These include commodities, United States Treasury's and select fiat currencies, equity strategies and hedge funds, as well as more tangible assets such as precious metals (gold and silver), real estate and even art. Now, cryptocurrencies have been added to that list. Although Bitcoin's origins are firmly rooted in a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, a funny thing happened on the way to fulfilling those utilitarian aims. Satoshi Nakamoto's blockchain-based creation morphed into something much more akin to a security, as long settlement and transaction times make it a less attractive method of payment. Meanwhile, its rise in value over the last decade has far exceeded anyone's expectations: Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class including real estate, gold and the S&P 500.""

In a recent NASDAQ article, Ebang International Holdings (NASDAQ: EBON), which makes equipment for cryptocurrency mining in China, announced terms for its IPO recently. In its latest filing, the company selected the Nasdaq as its listing exchange and added Prime Number Capital as an underwriter.

The Zhejiang, China-based company plans to raise $106 million by offering 19.3 million shares at a price range of $4.50 to $6.50. At the midpoint of the proposed range, Ebang International Holdings would command a market value of $721 million.

Ebang International Holdings was founded in 2010 and booked $109 million in revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019. It plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol EBON. AMTD Global Markets, Loop Capital Markets, and Prime Number Capital are the joint bookrunners on the deal. Find out more about EBON by visiting: https://www.ebang.co/

The Cointelegraph.com article concluded: ""Bitcoin's financial status has evolved yet another step and is seen in many circles as a safe-haven instrument. Complete decentralization is at its core, keeping Bitcoin away from the whims of central banking and governments' appetites for quantitative easing. In a brilliant stroke, digital scarcity is hardwired into its DNA: The supply of tokens is firmly capped at 21 million, a key characteristic that should continue to drive its price higher over time and has led to the widespread perception that Bitcoin equals ""digital gold.""

Other recent developments in the markets this week include:

Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ: CAN) a leading high-performance computing solutions provider, recently announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2020 increased by 417.0% to RMB2.4 million (US$0.4 million) from RMB0.5 million in the same period of 2019. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2020 expanded to 3.5% from 1.0% in the same period of 2019.

""On behalf of our team at Canaan, I wish to sincerely thank all of the medical staff and community workers who are combating the COVID-19 pandemic on the frontlines to keep our society moving forward,"" commented Mr. Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canaan. ""As the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, we continued to refine our R&D capabilities to develop a strong lineup of next-generation products. In addition, we also lowered the barrier for consumers to enter the Bitcoin mining space through a series of SaaS solutions designed to help our clients reduce the costs of maintaining our mining machines. As such, we further improved the quality of our product offerings and strengthened our value propositions, which allowed us to minimize the impact of the fluctuations in Bitcoin price and related derivatives during the Bitcoin halving. Going forward, we expect that our core commitment to technological innovation, product leadership and strong service value proposition to our clients will fuel our growth in the years to come and help create sustainable value for our shareholders.""

Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) one of the few Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining companies in the United States, recently announced continued improvements and optimization of its bitcoin (""BTC"") production, via the relocation of its 4,000 Bitmain S17 Pro miners from Oklahoma City to Coinmint, LLC's (""Coinmint"") facility, in Massena, New York. The Company also announces corporate updates and its BTC production update for the month of May 2020.

As previously disclosed, Riot entered into a colocation agreement with Coinmint. The transition to Coinmint is an important part of Riot's focus to improve its production cost efficiencies and mining output. The Coinmint energy pricing and hosting arrangement is expected to significantly decrease the direct cost of BTC production as compared to Riot's Oklahoma City operation, while also appreciably increasing mining uptime. Additionally, Riot now has a clear path forward to continue expanding its total hashing capacity.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently unveiled the NVIDIA® Mellanox® UFM® Cyber-AI platform, which minimizes downtime in InfiniBand data centers by harnessing AI-powered analytics to detect security threats and operational issues, as well as predict network failures.

This extension of the UFM platform product portfolio — which has managed InfiniBand systems for nearly a decade — applies AI to learn a data center's operational cadence and network workload patterns, drawing on both real-time and historic telemetry and workload data. Against this baseline, it tracks the system's health and network modifications, and detects performance degradations, usage and profile changes.

The new platform provides alerts of abnormal system and application behavior, and potential system failures and threats, as well as performs corrective actions. It is also targeted to deliver security alerts in cases of attempted system hacking to host undesired applications, such as cryptocurrency mining. The result is reduced data center downtime — which typically costs more than $300,000 an hour, according to research by ITIC.

Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) one of the few Nasdaq listed cryptocurrency mining companies in the United States, recently announced the purchase of an additional 500 of the latest generation Bitmain S19 Pro Miners. These 500 miners will produce 110 TH/s and generate 55 PH/s (petahash) of hashing power, bringing the Company's total Hashrate to approximately 240 PH/s when fully deployed. This compares to the Company's previous S-9 production of 46 PH/s. The purchase price paid was $1,190,000. The Company expects to take delivery of these latest units by the end of September.

On May 11, 2020, Marathon announced the purchase of 700 M30S+ (80 TH) miners which now have been fully installed and are operational. On May 12, 2020, the Company announced the purchase 660 Bitmain S19 Pro Miners followed by the announced purchase of an additional 500 on May 19, 2020. Today's announcement of the purchase of an additional 500 S19 Pro Miners brings the total state of the art, next generation miners purchased in the past month to 2,360 units. The Company is expecting delivery and installation of 1,160 Bitmain S19 Pro ASIC Miners in approximately the next 30-60 days, followed by the remaining 500 shortly thereafter.

Watchdogs Snarl

New York’s financial watchdog has warned crypto companies their BitLicense applications could be thrown out after “three strikes” of failing to address deficiencies highlighted by the regulator. Meanwhile, the European Union is preparing a new cryptocurrency regime that could include stricter requirements for “global stablecoin” projects such as Libra. Finally, the DoJ and SEC have filed charges against the founder of “AML Bitcoin,” a crypto which claimed to include anti-money laundering protections. AML Bitcoin’s founders are known for (erroneously) claiming the National Football League rejected an AML Bitcoin advertisement for being too controversial.

Tidy Endings?

The Sovrin Foundation, a U.S.-based umbrella organization that oversees the development of blockchain-based digital identity standards, or self-sovereign identity (SSI), laid off nine full-time and six part-time employees in March, officially becoming a volunteer-run operation. Sovrin works with the likes of IBM, Cisco and T-Mobile, and was unable to complete a fundraising campaign that started before the COVID-19 crisis hit. Elsewhere, CEO Kris Marszalek said Crypto.com will refund 100% of customer funds as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspended the activities of Wirecard Card Solutions, a subsidiary of the Wirecard Group, which filed for insolvency on Thursday after admitting last week to be missing $2.1 billion. Funds will be refunded within 48 hours.

Grants & Partnerships

Nearly half a dozen companies have announced new grants for open-source bitcoin contributors and projects since the coronavirus crisis began, from exchanges such as Kraken and OKCoin to the Human Rights Foundation. Grants are generally around $150,000 each. Wasabi Wallet-maker zkSNACKs Ltd is the latest to join the cohort by donating 1 bitcoin to the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund. Meanwhile, in a collaborative effort between Australia Post and Bitcoin.com.au, customers will now be able to use the Post Billpay feature to purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, using cash or cards, at over 3,500 post offices across the country.

Bitcoin Mining

Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen is trying to stop Canadian firm DMG Blockchain from plugging its bitcoin mining rigs into the American power grid. DMG Blockchain has been aggressively expanding its cryptocurrency mining capacity in recent months by tripling its fleet of ASIC and applying for permission to export U.S. electricity, writing that its 15 megawatt mining operation will grow to 60 megawatts in the next year.

Message Received

Telegram will pay $18.5 million and notify the SEC if it plans to issue any sort of digital currency in the next three years in a proposed settlement, effectively ending a six-month court fight. The messaging platform will be responsible for a $1.22 billion disgorgement offset by $1.19 billion paid as “termination amounts.”

Market intel

Bitcoin Narrative Deflated

New Federal Reserve data shows a 78.6% chance of entering a U.S. deflation – the highest since 2008 – putting a pin in the narrative that bitcoin’s price will soar as an inflationary hedge. Some bitcoin optimists suggest the cryptocurrency would appreciate in a deflationary environment – if its adoption as a medium of exchange rises, as discussed in April. This is because deflation boosts the purchasing power of the monetary unit. For this reason, the U.S. dollar tends to appreciate during deflationary bouts.

Exchange Spreads

Trading U.S. dollars for bitcoin can have fairly different order sizes and spreads depending on the exchange, and no two are alike. Average order sizes over the past week were quite varied, CryptoCompare found. Orders on Bitstamp averaged $3,424.11, the highest of major dollar to bitcoin (USD/BTC) pair exchanges. ItBit was second to Bitstamp at $2,874.17, with Kraken at $2787.68. Gemini’s average was in the middle of the pack at $1,438.31, followed by Coinbase at $1,113.15. Bitfinex was lowest, with an average order totaling $342.09. The average order of the six exchanges was $1,996.58.

Bitcoin Only Matters Because the Game Is Rigged

The Let’s Talk Bitcoin! hosts gather to discuss the big picture problems facing our world that make things like bitcoin distinctly appealing.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-06-26 16:05:41+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-cryptos-diversity-problem,"A few years ago, when MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini was leading an interactive digital art project, she found the facial recognition technology it employed was far better at recognizing her lighter-skinned MIT colleagues.

The discovery sent Buolamwini on a mission. She founded the Algorithmic Justice League and started doing research that builds awareness about biases in software algorithms. One paper she co-authored with Timnit Gebru, the technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google, found facial-analysis software had an error rate of 34.7% for dark-skinned women versus just 0.8% for light-skinned men.

Facial recognition is the tip of the iceberg. Biases are inherently present in all forms of artificial intelligence algorithms, those digital machines that increasingly run our world.

Over the years, an extreme lack of diversity in computer engineering has left white men with a disproportionately large influence over all software design. Unconscious bias – now, finally, a topic of great discussion across the United States – means they end up creating products to serve the needs of people like them, not necessarily those of others.

This is a vital issue for the algorithm-dependent cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. If this technology is to have a broad impact on the world, it must engage a wide population.

If bitcoin, for example, is to become a global currency, if it is to become a monetary standard accepted by people of vastly different backgrounds, it must be accessible and valuable for a full cross-section of those groups. And if distributed ledger technologies end up providing the data architecture in “smart cities” or enabling our health systems to manage privacy-protected data for fighting pandemics, we better make sure these platforms don’t discriminate against one group or another.

Diversifying the dev teams

The need for diversity in this industry was the central theme in a virtual symposium held last Friday by Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, which coincided with the Juneteenth emancipation holiday. The panelists’ message, according to CoinDesk reporter Nathan DiCamillo, was that while crypto can help citizens opt out of “a racist financial system,” for that to happen “Black people and people of color must be part of the development of the technology.”

Calls for diversity like these are often met with retorts such as “bitcoin doesn’t care about the color of your skin” or “blockchains are based on math, not flawed human processes.” It’s a naive perspective. The code for the protocols that dictate each blockchain’s rules, and for the smart contracts and apps built on top of them, are written by people, not by some universal law of nature. And, in the blockchain community even more so than in tech broadly, those people are predominantly white men.

Don’t think, either, that blockchain technology is protected against bias by its preference for open-source development. A codebase can be fully accessible but if there isn’t a sufficiently wide group of skilled people reviewing and contributing to it, biases will persist.

It’s true, this technology has the potential to help people overturn some of society’s ingrained, structural injustices. As investor and active #BlackLivesMatter supporter Mike Novogratz says, “Crypto is about systems change.” But a decentralized system is only as inclusive as the platform on which it is built. There’s nothing intrinsically fair about a blockchain.

Action plans

A key problem is the digital divide. Impoverished communities of color worldwide have significantly reduced access to the information tools needed to participate in blockchain and crypto development.

Addressing these imbalances is vital for crypto adoption. While it’s exciting to see usage rates grow in places like Nigeria and Venezuela during the COVID-19 crisis, we must also recognize the painful circumstances leading these people to bitcoin and stablecoins: economic breakdown, severe dollar shortages and failed public health systems. And in the grand scheme of things, those newly increased numbers are a tiny proportion of the total developing world population. We have a long way to go before we bridge the crypto divide.

A natural starting point is education. While a number of interest groups have sprung up to support the expansion of blockchain knowledge among women and people of color, the industry must do more. Funds should be dedicated to high schools and colleges serving underprivileged students about the technology and the opportunities it poses. Online courses and self-training programs should be designed for and delivered to minorities. And, of course, crypto companies should also be hiring from those communities.

Equally important, media organizations like ours and people like me who work at them must learn to identify, address and fight against our own implicit biases. The stories we write are vital to how information is absorbed about this technology. We need many more of them to be for, about and by people of color and women.

Like all media, crypto newsrooms and their management must confront this diversity imperative head on. CoinDesk is no exception. Only with a broad spectrum of voices across race, gender, geography and economic background can we properly expose the world to the opportunities and challenges posed by the technology we cover.

It’s all about the debt

What a difference two months of COVID-19 makes.

This week, the International Monetary Fund made an interim update to the quarterly World Economic Outlook Report it originally released in April. The headline item: The IMF now expects a massive, unprecedented 4.9% decline in world economic output for 2020, versus the 3% shrinkage it previously predicted. That’s an additional loss of $1.67 trillion from what the World Bank estimated as the size of the global economy in 2019. You have to go back to the Great Depression for economic malaise on this kind of scale.

What’s just as striking, and arguably more worrying, was the accompanied forecasts for government debt as a result of this downturn. The IMF now expects net government borrowing in advanced countries to spike to 10.9% of GDP in 2020 from 3% in 2019 and that it will drop back to 5.4% in 2021.

The problem with governments’ ballooning debt levels is not the amount borrowed per se. It’s the interdependent nature of it and the geopolitical ramifications.

Unlike a person or a company, a country cannot go bankrupt. It’s a permanent entity with exclusive taxation powers and mostly exclusive money-printing power. (The latter is why proponents of Modern Monetary Theory, like new author Stephanie Kelton, argue fiscal deficits should not be viewed as a problem.) Indeed, governments right now have a compelling case – even an obligation – to borrow at low interest rates and fund the social distributions needed to keep their economy’s income levels afloat. Viewed in the isolation of one country and one government, this is one of those no-brainer moments when you focus on the problem at hand and worry about the cost later.

The problem that MMT proponents seem to gloss over is the financial system is globalized – and overly dependent on the U.S. dollar – while politics is domesticized. Governments are accountable to their citizens, not to the foreign entities that own much of their debt and that measure their wealth in a foreign currency.

Governments will naturally choose the former over the latter, helping out domestic borrowers at the cost of foreign savers by debasing their currency. And if they’re the only government with such a problem, the fallout can be limited to those foreign entities. But what happens when every major government is in the same situation? This is why some fear the nightmare of a global currency war and debt spiral, one that could seriously undermine the dollar, the currency upon which this international financial system is based.

Some people see the need for a coordinated, global debt jubilee (or forgiveness). But getting everyone to agree on the terms is almost impossible to imagine. Another outcome: The world gravitates to a new international currency system. The question is whether that happens in a controlled, top-down manner, with governments agreeing to a new framework, a la the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, or through a more unpredictable bottom-up, private-sector-led monetary revolution. The technology is coming into place for that revolution.

The Global Town Hall

ECHOES OF 2008. If there’s a reason to doubt the IMF’s forecast that advanced country debt-to-GDP levels will start normalizing in 2021, it’s that there’s another shoe to drop: private debt. Unlike the financial crisis of 2008, where the culprit was retail sector lending to homeowners, this time the private sector risk lies with mountains of corporate debt accumulated over the past, low-interest rate decade. Now, as The Wall Street Journal detailed Thursday, that debt load is combining with the economic stress of COVID-19 to trigger a “wave of bankruptcies.” The structure of a lot of that debt is defined by something called a CLO, or collateralized loan obligation. Sound familiar? It’s very much like a CDO, a collateralized debt obligation, the financial instrument that sat at the heart of the prior financial crisis. It has many people worried about another systemic collapse. If that happens, there’ll need to be another round of bailouts. And if that happens, governments will need to take on even more debt.

ROME NO LONGER. For the past century, the center of global financial power lay not in Washington but to its north, in New York. Because so much global trade and financial market activity has been denominated in dollars, international payments and capital flows inevitably must pass through correspondent banks located on Wall Street. That gives those banks, and the regulators who oversee them, great power as global gatekeepers. With a say-so over what money goes where, New York state regulators wield this power to impose sanctions on countries deemed by U.S. intelligence to be rogue states and to determine what classes of activity are worthy of vital banking services. It’s why the New York Department of Financial Services is not just your average state regulator. Its influence extends beyond New York’s borders, not only into all other 49 states but overseas as well.

But on the fifth anniversary of the NYDFS’ controversial “BitLicense,” it’s worth reflecting on the agency’s failure to extend its regulatory power over the cryptocurrency industry to a wider landscape. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson did just that this week, noting how the then-NYDFS superintendent. Benjamin Lawsky. had predicted in 2014 the BitLicense would become a standard that other states’ regulators would follow. This assumption, founded on the hubris of New York’s outsized global status, proved wrong. Nelson reports that “Lawsky’s NYDFS had created what legislatures in other states now consider a case study in how not to regulate an industry whose complex technical details can quickly confound over-broad and ill-defined rules.” Crypto may be the first financial industry to subvert New York’s regulatory grip on global finance. Beginning of the end?

OIL’S CRYPTO-LIKE VOLATILITY. A tweet thread by Patrick Chovanec caught my attention. Boy, have oil prices been volatile over the past 12 years. Not quite crypto-level volatility, but pretty extreme for a commodity that’s a mainstay of the global economy. It’s all about the competing swings in demand and supply since 2008: the mix of financial crises, monetary policy-stoked speculation, the fracking revolution, Saudi Arabian political maneuvers within OPEC, and now a pandemic-fueled global economic shutdown. Who knows where crude prices will go from here? But with so much resting on them – questions of environmental sustainability, for one, but also the stability of the Middle East – crypto watchers should monitor them closely. Here’s why: The dollar’s fate as the world’s dominant currency is not insignificantly tied to the direction of oil markets because crude contracts are priced and settled in greenbacks. If oil-producing countries in sanctioned countries like Iran feel compelled by price movements to boost supply, a crypto solution that bypasses the dollar could help them do so. Alternatively, if locally sourced renewable energy usage starts to expand rapidly, the global trade in both oil and dollars will fall. The future of oil is one of many pieces in the puzzle driving a reimagining of money.

THE POWER OF MANY VOICES. The results are in for CoinDesk’s #NYBWGIVES charity drive for COVID-19. The month-long campaign, conducted with our Blockchain Week partners Gitcoin, Ethereal Summit and the Giving Block, raised $110,000, most of it in crypto-denominated donations, for 12 different charities. As promised at the campaign launch during our Consensus Distributed conference, CoinDesk is matching those donations with distributions totalling $50,000. Half of those funds will be assigned according to Gitcoin’s capital-constrained liberal radicalism (CLR) methodology, which aims to democratize grant and subsidy distribution. It meant that although two big “bitcoin whale” donations turned the International Medical Corps into the runaway winner in terms of total funds raised, the No Kid Hungry charity received more than three times as much in matching funds even though it raised less than a third of International Medical Corps’ tally. That’s because the latter’s intake came from twice as many contributors. This “power to the many” concept stems from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Microsoft Principal Researcher Glen Weyl’s work on “quadratic funding.” Read about it and watch the explainer video in our write-up of the charity drive.

Zumo, the Edinburgh-based cryptocurrency wallet and exchange platform, has taken its first step towards the creation of a seamless fiat-to-cryptocurrency payments system with the launch of a sterling (GBP) functionality, powered by Modulr, the digital payments platform.

From mid-July, the partnership will allow Zumo users in the UK to hold GBP funds within the Zumo wallet, as well as buy and sell cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).



The new functionality gives users more control of the currencies they hold with Zumo. The Zumo app already allows users to own BTC and ETH on-chain, managed by private keys which only the individual can access.



The measures which are designed to increase user control over their finances will be followed by the addition of a stablecoin to the Zumo platform in the coming weeks, as well as an optimisation in its fiat-crypto exchanges, making transfers faster and cheaper.



The London-based scale-up fintech Modulr offers ‘Payments as a Service” as an alternative to commercial and wholesale transaction banking, already partners with over 100 financial leaders including Revolut, Sage, and Liberis, having processed over £30 billion in payments to date. Modulr eliminates hidden inefficiencies, streamlines existing services and makes payments a competitive advantage to power the emerging Instant Economy, where customers expect instant access to services, be they films or finance.



Last month, Modulr raised a further £18.9 million in growth funding from Highland Europe, bringing total funds received by the scale-up to just over £53.3 million since its inception in 2016. In March, the fintech announced it had joined the global payments network, Visa, as a principal issuing member.



Zumo also recently announced the backing of Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman and Murray Capital’s David Murray alongside its plan to introduce a convertible contactless debit card and an ultra-secure messaging service.



Zumo’s founder Nick Jones commented: “We are delighted to partner with an exciting brand like Modulr who shares our vision to solve the problems of access in traditional banking. Zumo is on a mission to radically improve the security, cost and speed of payments globally, and the addition of GBP alongside cryptocurrencies takes us one step closer.”



Myles Stephenson, Chief Executive and Founder at Modulr commented: “We are delighted to power the innovation that Zumo is bringing to the market and UK economy. We are proud to provide the underlying GBP payments infrastructure upon which Zumo build and enhances its services, as it shakes up the digital asset market and presents its customers with an experience fit for the Instant Economy.”",2020-06-26 09:27:00

Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist behind one of the biggest Washington lobbying scandals as portrayed in the feature film Casino Jack, has been charged in connection with AML bitcoin cryptocurrency. He faces returning to jail after previously serving three and a half years in prison.

Jack Abramoff Charged in Cryptocurrency Fraud Case

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Thursday that lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Rowland Marcus Andrade have been “charged with fraud in connection with $5 million initial coin offering of cryptocurrency AML bitcoin.”

It has been more than 14 years since Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty in one of the biggest Washington lobbying scandals in U.S. history. Now the 62-year-old has reportedly agreed to enter guilty pleas on charges in two separate schemes, one of which involves a cryptocurrency project called “AML bitcoin,” with which he allegedly helped Andrade defraud investors. The DOJ alleges:

Andrade and Abramoff conspired to make false and misleading statements to potential purchasers of a proposed new cryptocurrency called AML bitcoin.

The charging document states that “Andrade claimed to be the creator of AML bitcoin and inventor of its technology that purportedly would prevent money laundering and anonymous use through ‘biometric technologies.'” He further “claimed this technology would allow the AML bitcoin cryptocurrency to comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws and regulations.” Andrade and his company NAC Foundation sold AML bitcoin to investors in the U.S. and globally through at least December 2018, raising more than $5 million, the DOJ noted. “Andrade defrauded investors by misusing funds that were raised and laundered funds that were illegally obtained.”

Andrade has been charged in the indictment with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering. If convicted, he “faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate, for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and a maximum sentence of 20 years and a fine of $500,000 for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1),” the DOJ explained.

Abramoff has been charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the provisions of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. In 2017, he was allegedly “retained by a client in the marijuana industry, and that the engagement in part involved efforts to advocate for changes in federal law and policy,” the DOJ added. However, “The information filed against Abramoff also alleges that he knowingly and corruptly failed to register as a lobbyist, as required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act.” The Justice Department continued:

This is the first ever known prosecution of a lobbyist for a criminal violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.

“Abramoff faces a maximum sentence of 5 years, and a fine of $250,000 for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and a maximum sentence of 5 years and a fine of $250,000, for violation of 2 U.S.C. § 1606(b),” the DOJ wrote.

In addition to criminal charges, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has separately filed civil charges against both Abramoff and Andrade over the AML bitcoin cryptocurrency scheme for “alleging securities fraud and acting as unregistered brokers of securities, among other charges,” the Justice Department described.

Jack Abramoff has spent time in federal prison before. After a guilty plea in a lobbying scandal and his dealings with Suncruz Casinos in January 2006, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for mail fraud, conspiracy to bribe public officials, and tax evasion. He served 43 months and was released on December 3, 2010. He then authored the autobiographical book called “Capitol Punishment: The Hard Truth About Washington Corruption From America’s Most Notorious Lobbyist.” Abramoff’s stories have been made into two films: the documentary “Casino Jack and the United States of Money” and the feature film “Casino Jack,” starring Kevin Spacey as Abramoff.

According to U.S. Attorney David Anderson, Abramoff has agreed to plead guilty to criminal conspiracy charges and a criminal violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act in the AML bitcoin case and could face up to five years in prison.

Bitcoin prices have been hovering around $9K for quite a few days making it a lucrative investment opportunity for thousands of Indians

Bitcoin is the Pandora’s Box in terms of investment – it can be both good and bad unless you are careful about where you are investing.

Ever since its launch in 2008, controversy has not left Bitcoin’s site. It has fuelled hundreds of rags-to-riches stories, but at the same time, it has enabled scammers to earn millions from unsuspecting buyers and investors.

Bitcoin prices have been hovering around $9,000 for quite a few days making it a lucrative investment opportunity for thousands of Indians. If you are among the thousands looking forward to investing in the future of crypto, you must find out all about potential Bitcoin scams and the ways to steer clear of them:

Fake Crypto Investment Platforms

Fake bitcoin exchanges are a real threat! Back in 2017, a South Korean fake exchange was operating under the name of BitKRK. While it looked legit and presented itself as a part of the crypto trading community, it swindled investors and buyers out of millions of dollars before it was intercepted by the South Korean financial authorities.

You must avoid all fake cryptocurrency exchanges. Stick to the reputed and recognized bitcoin exchanges only. Check Bitcoin forums and subscribe to authentic RSS feeds or notifications so you receive the news of fake exchanges on time. or, stick to trustworthy Bitcoin platforms for genuine investment opportunities.

Others Less Credible Cryptocurrencies

After the success and skyrocketing demand of Bitcoin, several new cryptocurrencies have been mushrooming across the globe. It is indeed difficult to keep an eye on the authenticity and performance of each one.

New altcoins can be cheaper, which makes them more of a lucrative investment opportunity to most new investors. The selling idea behind these new currencies is that it’s already too late to invest in bitcoin and one must seize the opportunity to invest in one of the new and upcoming ones to make more money!

Well, that’s not at all true. Always remember that My Big Coin was taken down after it sold fake alt currencies for $6 Mn to customers.

However, it is important to take a look at the basics of any altcoin including its maximum supply and circulation. For example, Bitcoin maximum supply is 21 Mn exactly and 18 Mn are in circulation. Bitcoin is one of the most valued, trusted and most accepted cryptocurrencies across the globe.

Mining Scams

Cloud mining allows regular investors without expensive hardware to mine cryptocurrencies. It can be indeed lucrative if you consider that you can mine altcoins like Bitcoin sitting at home without investing in exuberantly priced hardware.

There are a few cloud mining services that allow users to rent server space at a fixed rate for mining altcoins. However, if you are a first-time investor, how do you know which services are genuine, and which ones just want your hard-earned money?

One way to identify the fake ones is by their lofty promises. They promise implausible returns on your investment and never mention the hidden fee that applies on these returns. These servers are smart designs to take money from unsuspecting investors. No authentic companies should be able to guarantee a profit.

Always be vigilant while signing up for cloud mining servers. Think about the security of your data on your system before you go online on a shared server.

Pump And Dump schemes

It is not uncommon for groups of scammers to buy a new altcoin en masse. That increases the market price of the cryptocurrency momentarily and triggers FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) among other investors.

As soon as the new investors begin investing in the new coin and the prices shoot up higher, the scammers sell their share of coins for a higher price.

It is illegal in the securities market, but pumping and dumping are more than common in the grey zone of cryptocurrencies. Avoid pump and dump schemes by choosing more popular and stable crypto options like Bitcoin only.

Malware

New investors don’t always understand the ins-and-outs of cryptocurrency before and during investing. This has given several malware programs the chance to evolve. Malware programs now pose newer and bigger threats to people.

Modern malware that targets cryptocurrency users and investors can latch onto the user accounts to retrieve the user’s online wallet balance, drain their account and replace their authentic address with that of the scammer.

Apart from updating your antivirus and system firewall, you need to make sure that you are visiting a secure and trustworthy platform that does not prompt auto-download of .exe files or ask you to download suspicious attachments.",2020-06-27 15:35:15+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/wright-decision-paypal-allowing-crypto-bad-crypto-news-of-the-week,"It’s been a relatively calm time for Bitcoin this week. The price has dropped a little, but not much and it’s still tickling $10,000. That makes concerns about a correction that takes the coin as low as $7,700 feel moot. If it happens, some experts say it would be a buying opportunity. Others though, think that price would be great for sellers. Investor Jim Rogers thinks that Bitcoin will eventually fall to zero and fade away.

Max Keiser hopes that Rogers is wrong. The RT television personality has been saying that buying Bitcoin is the best way to address the social and economic problems highlighted in America’s recent demonstrations. Tearing down statues does nothing, he says. Only Bitcoin will change the world.

For that to happen, Bitcoin needs to be easier to buy and sell. That’s happening. PayPal and Venmo are said to have plans to allow crypto trades. LibertyX, best known for its Bitcoin ATMs, now lets customers buy Bitcoins over the counter at 7-Eleven, CVS Pharmacy, and Rite Aid. And in Australia, customers can now buy Bitcoins at more than 3,500 local post offices.

As mass take-up increases though, platforms will need to be more careful. Robinhood has promised to make improvements after a 20-year-old customer committed suicide. Alexander Kearns had reportedly seen a negative balance of $730,000 in his account. The balance was an error.

Wirecard, an issuer of cryptocurrency debit cards, is missing about $2.1 billion. According to reports in the Financial Times, employees in Dubai and Dublin have been inflating sales and profits for nearly a decade.

In other inflated claims, Satoshi-pretender Craig Wright won’t receive court sanctions. U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom has ruled that a jury should decide on the “unsettling issues” relating to Wright’s credibility and behavior. Wright says that the court should take his autism into account.

Technology firms might need to take the government into account if a new bill passes in the Senate. The Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, sponsored by Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), would require service providers and device makers to give the government access to encrypted data.

Things are looking a bit better in Sweden. The country’s central bank has released a review that takes a long look at digital currencies in general and at the e-krona in particular.

That would take a central bank where no other central bank has gone before—which is what William Shatner has done. The first captain of the Starship Enterprise has turned his memorabilia into non-fungible tokens traded on the WAX blockchain. He could find that the blockchain is a good place to retire. It’s working for CryptoKitties. Upland has set aside an island in its virtual world for the digital cats to spend their time and enjoy the beaches. It sounds like next week is going to calm for some.

The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/12-lessons-from-winning-and-losing-12-million-in-crypto,"Over the last few years, I gained over $12 million dollars investing in cryptocurrencies. I did not take a single profit until they maxed out at a hundredfold at the very peak of the market in December 2017. The timing was perfect, I nailed it. However, I only took a small percentage of those gains to then reinvest in a blockchain startup.

Then, the market crashed on me. I didn’t sell or de-risk my positions. If anything, I participated in pre-ICOs, adding more risk — and losses — to the table. This is what I’ve learned from riding the crypto market all the way up and down:

Holding is the easy strategy, but not the most profitable one. If all you are doing in the most volatile market that has probably ever existed is playing “long-term optimistic ostrich,” like I did, you are missing out on opportunity. Long-term confidence is a strong start, but identifying the cycles and patterns to minimize losses in prolonged bear markets is much better. In hard times, big coins or stablecoins, in soft times — small coins. Check the standing of your altcoins at least every three months, or you might lose them. Coins get delisted from exchanges, exchanges close down, tokens upgrade protocols. Make sure the number of different altcoins you own is manageable. Until the market matures and is able to more precisely tell apples from avocados, altcoins will continue their high price correlation. You may not need to own every single one you like. Have a written exit plan. At least a reference to execute against. You don’t want to figure out your exit strategy in the middle of a rollercoaster. I didn’t have one three years ago, but now I do. It includes diversifying into other industries. It’s impossible to sell at the very peak and buy at the very bottom. To think that the market is going to turn around after months of decline and only start going up the minute you buy is not very realistic. Multiple times I lost 70% of an investment in the months after buying a coin and aiming for a subsequent forty-fold return. However... Pay attention to the current stage of the project you are planning to invest in. There are networks, like Polymath, that may be extremely successful and profitable in the long run. However, to launch, they raised funds and used them for product development, market research, overcoming critical regulatory hurdles, testing, etc. All of this takes years. During this time, supply of these tokens enters the market through investor/advisor distributions while there is little demand or use yet, so the attention goes to other projects and the prices drop drastically. We all like the hype of participating in ICOs, however, it may likely be possible to buy at lower prices and much lower risk a couple of years down the road in platforms that have a proven product, a regulatory approved business plan, and are ready for commercialization. The crypto market is not for everybody. My mother told me, “If it was so easy to make that much money, everybody would do it.” To me that’s like telling Rafael Nadal, “If it was so easy to make so much money hitting a ball with a racket, everybody would do it.” Yes, in crypto, you can make a lot of money very quickly, but you can lose a lot of money very quickly as well. To be “competitive” in the market, you need a clear head, a strong stomach and vetted information. Some luck, good timing and knowing what you are doing is also recommended. It’s not that easy to play tennis like Rafael Nadal. Don’t pay off your mortgage until you are 100% sure you won’t need to borrow cash in the foreseeable future if crypto — no matter how much — is all you have. Once you quit your corporate job and have no steady paycheck, you are on your own and too risky to do business with. No more corporate America warmth when it comes to getting good health insurance or refinancing a house. Don’t be like most people and don’t be driven by fear. At a minimum, be aware of the narrator’s voice inside your head. For most people, there’s never a good time to enter the market. When the market drops, “it’s over,” and when it heats up, “it’s too late.” There is always a fear-based excuse not to try out something fun, risky and adventurous. I have a cousin who researched and researched the market until his balls went blue. It felt like he was doing a Ph.D. He didn’t end up investing. It had nothing to do with the market. Not fun. We have no freakin’ idea of what constitutes “too high” or “too low.” Crypto is a new kind of animal, so extreme that there usually is a higher high and a lower low. The volatility in this market requires a broader perspective beyond our understanding of traditional markets. Three years ago, my parents told me to sell their Ether (ETH) at $45. They insisted and I reluctantly agreed. It was their money after all, so I had to. But when a few days later Ether’s price was still pumping, I thought, “I can’t believe I’m listening to my parents on this, they have no clue of where Ethereum can go,” and bought them back in at $60. Wasn’t $13 “too high” for Bitcoin (BTC) at the end of 2012? Of course it was! Most people sell because they have no idea of how high a coin can fly or because “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” My problem is the opposite: The market goes down and I think, “No way I’m selling, it’s too low,” and it keeps going lower, and lower. I sink with the ship all the way to the bottom because for me it’s always “too low to sell.” That’s not very sophisticated, either. I still need to find a practical way to stop losses and do better. Have mature and grounded friends in the industry for those moments of knife-falling red charts or year-long walks through the bear desert to tell you: “I give a shit about what’s happening, I’ve seen this a dozen times before.” It feels so good to hear that from someone who knows their shit. Make a clear distinction between your sourness in the market and what the market may do in the future. Just because you’ve done good, it doesn’t mean it’s going to go up forever, and just because you are distressed that you entered at the peak before the burst, it doesn’t mean that the market is never coming back up again. Some of my friends won’t put one more dollar into the market because they’ve been burned. The fact that you can’t psychologically bear one more loss doesn’t mean the market is not going back up. Distinguish between your personal circumstances and the world out there. Just because someone broke your heart, it doesn’t mean that all men or women are however you are telling yourself they are. Start talking about what your decisions really mean so that you can have more clarity (i.e. “I’m full of fear and won’t forgive myself if I lose more money”), and stop projecting your fears into the market (i.e. “The market will never recover”). These two things have nothing to do with each other. Stop protecting yourself and start calling things for what they are regardless of whether you invest or not.

Bonus lesson (and no, it’s not “don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose”):

Be proud you followed your guts and listened to your heart, regardless of the outcome. Of course it’s disappointing to lose that much money, and most people probably would have known better than that. The turnaround question is: How many of them would have put themselves in a position to lose that amount in the first place?

To me, investing — and life — is a tradeoff between mitigating risk and taking advantage of opportunity. Which of these two is more exciting for you when you invest? I know I don’t like to miss out on opportunity, so I need to have a huge tolerance for risk if I want to sleep at night.

Some of the people who love me most (particularly my parents) can’t drop the “I told you you should have sold.” True, I should have sold, but not at a 40% or a 300% gain, which is what they would have done. I’m not in crypto for that. The fact that I should have sold more at a 10,000% gain, though, I can agree with.

Some of my crypto friends also regret not selling at the all-time high peak. One of them told me, “If instead of partying that night in December 2017 we would all have been selling.” True, but how much fun did I have that night treating all my crypto friends! Epic. Those months in the spring and winter of 2017, and then January 2018 with CoinMarketCap washed in double-digit green across the board... How much I enjoyed that ride to the top, nobody knows. Can’t wait for more, and I am all buckled up. I’m ready to moon again, and this time there is no coming back.

The popular bitcoin analyst Willy Woo told his 132,000 Twitter followers that he’s working on a new pricing model that suggests a bull run is imminent. In fact, Woo says the model suggests bitcoin is close to “another bullish run” with “maybe another month to go.”

The price of bitcoin (BTC) has been declining during the last seven days, as BTC has lost 2% overall this past week. The value has been bouncing back and forth between $8,800 to a touch over $10k per BTC. At the time of writing on Sunday, June 27, 2020, the price has been fluctuating between $9,010 to $9,150 during the last 24 hours.

The $165 billion market valuation, still makes up 63% of the entire market valuation of all 5,000+ crypto assets. Despite the downturn, a number of analysts expect a bullish run to come to fruition in the near future. On Sunday, Willy Woo (@woonomic), the well known bitcoin chart analyst and the cofounder of Hypersheet tweeted that he’s been developing a new pricing model for BTC.

“This is a new model I’m working on, it picks the start of exponential bull runs,” Woo tweeted. “Bitcoin was setting up for a bullish run until the COVID white swan killed the party. This model suggests we are close to another bullish run. Maybe another month to go,” he added.

Showing another chart, Woo said that the second graph “very clearly shows how [Covid-19] was a model breaking outlier.” And another chart Woo published indicates that “the longer this bull market takes to wind up, the higher the peak price (Top Cap model). A long sideways accumulation band is ultimately a good thing,” Woo further stressed.

Essentially what the Hypersheet cofounder told his 132,000 Twitter followers is that his new model shows that BTC is “maybe” about a month away from lift-off. If it wasn’t for Covid-19, then Woo believes the bull market would have already started.

Of course, not everyone agreed with Woo’s prediction and the evidence stemming from his new model. “Technical analysis doesn’t work with BTC,” Adam Bornstein replied to Woo. “There are too many exchanges with too thin volume, too many [arbitrage] opportunities, and too much noise built into every move,” Bornstein added.

Although Woo stood up for his position and the analyst responded to Bornstein’s criticism. “I’d agree with you for intra-week moves, but this chart is 8 [years] of macro, where organic investment takes precedence,” Woo replied. Despite, Woo’s defense some still called the prediction “hopium.”

Other Bitcoin evangelists disagree with Woo’s prediction as well, as Tone Vays told the International Business Times (Ibtimes) there’s a chance “bitcoin’s price won’t exceed $10,000 until 2021.”

“Like I’ve been saying for months now, I have no reason to walk away from my prediction early in the year that Bitcoin is going to get stuck between $6,000 and $10,000 for the majority of this year,” Vays told the news outlet. Of course, Ibtimes also mentioned that Vays predicted a dive to $2,800 before the reward halving took place, but the analyst’s forecast never happened.

What do you think about the model Willy Woo created that says a bull run might be one month away? Let us know in the comments section below.

According to a report by research company Credmark, the volume of crypto-backed loans increased seven-fold in 2019, ultimately reaching $8 billion.

Experts speculate that crypto lending will attract more investors into the crypto market by increasing its liquidity.

“You can think of lending as this incredible grease that just pushes everything forward at a much faster rate”, states Paul Murphy, CEO at Credmark.

However, lending and borrowing crypto is a risky practice due to the high volatility of digital currencies.

In fact, a significant amount of crypto-backed loans are used for margin trading operations.

“When the market drops by more than 50 percent, and you're in a collateralized margin type of trade, you can lose all of your principal”, points out Brock Pierce, a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

While most crypto lending businesses rely on centralized custodians to manage their customers’ funds, DeFi lending platforms allow peer-to-peer lending and borrowing operations with no middlemen involved.

However, we are in the early stages of this technology, which means that these platforms may pose a number of usability downsides.

Bitcoin (BTC) sentiment analysis tools can be powerful. Used correctly, they can allow traders and investors to gauge whether crypto markets (and their participants) are feeling bullish or bearish.

So, with some claiming that the market is now hovering between bear and bull status, perhaps there is no better time than right now to look at three popular bitcoin sentiment analysis tools.

Below, we will take a look at how they work on their own (and perhaps together) – and look at ways you could use them to make smarter trading decisions.

Crypto Fear & Greed Index

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is arguably the most popular sentiment indicator currently being used in the bitcoin market.

It was created by the team behind Alternative.me, who created a solution not unlike CNN’s Fear & Greed Index. But instead of measuring sentiment in the stock market, like CNN’s tool, it measures crypto investor sentiment.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows whether investors are currently feeling bold or scared using a needle that moves from left to right, with measurements that move between the values of 0 and 100. The lower the value, the more fearful investors are. And the higher the index value, the greedier investors are feeling.

Factors that determine the index’s value include volatility, market momentum and volume, social media momentum and bitcoin dominance.

How to Use It

The Fear & Greed Index is very easy to understand and use. When the index shows that investors are concerned, it may well be a good time to buy. And when people are starting to show signs of greed, you might want to think about selling.

If the Fear & Greed Index sinks below 20, fear is prevalent, while a reading of 80+ could mean that smart investors sell while confidence soars.

Bulls & Bears Index

The Bulls & Bears Index, created by Augmento, is a social media sentiment indicator that shows how bullish or bearish conversations about bitcoin (BTC) are becoming on platforms like Twitter, Reddit and BitcoinTalk.

The index shows a value between 0 and 1. This value is computed using a classifier that is trained on crypto-specific language. This tool analyzes social media conversations and is sensitive to 93 different sentiments and topics.

How to Use It

The Bulls & Bears Index is a social media sentiment indicator that aims to gauge investor mood by analyzing social media mentions.

A low score, close to zero, suggests that bitcoin investors are bearish, while a high reading close to 1 suggests that investors are bullish on bitcoin on social media. If you believe in the wisdom of the crowd, then you might want to buy bitcoin when the Bulls & Bear Index starts to climb – and sell when it starts dropping.

Bitcoin Sentiment Index

The Bitcoin Sentiment Index, developed by Bitts Analytics, is another social media sentiment indicator that aims to provide insight into the way crypto investors feel at any given time.

The indicator’s value is computed using machine learning solutions that scan social media posts that mention bitcoin.

This may provide fascinating insights. But critics argue that it is difficult to gauge the tool’s viability as it is not immediately clear what factors exactly are taken into account during the computation process.

How to Use It

The Bitcoin Sentiment Index is a little more complex than both the Fear & Greed Index and the Bulls & Bears Index.

However, most traders will likely agree that it is not difficult to read. When the indicator line drops, the market sentiment is turning bearish. And when the indicator’s sentiment line climbs, investors are starting to express more bullish sentiments on social media.

Ultimately, it is important to bear in mind that market sentiment does not always dictate future price developments. Even if, for example, all of the indicators mentioned suggest that now is a good time to buy bitcoin, the price could still fall suddenly due to other factors.

Therefore, as discussed further in this article, bitcoin sentiment indicators should ideally be one of many of the tools in your arsenal of crypto market weapons. To use them as the sole basis of your trading strategy could be quite risky.

That said, as a trader, building up a wide range of tools will help you make better-educated and more informed estimates about where the market is heading next.

As such, getting to grips with one or more of the indicators discussed above could be of help when you are trying to forecast price movements based on trading data from technical indicators.

The potential continues growing every year — from the emergence of initial coin offerings, the first blockchain-based projects and speculation on Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to decentralized finance and central bank digital currencies.

Crypto has never run out of hot topics. Now, in 2020, the crypto asset field is no longer regarded as just another “dot-com bubble.” The subject is gaining more traction over the globe, and as COVID-19’s emergence has streamlined digital assets and crypto’s popularity, mainstream acceptance is just a few steps away. The derivatives market play may be too complicated for mainstream users, but it’s one of the currently popular directions that must not be neglected.

Leveraging the opportunity in crypto market reality

Alongside increasing interest from the general public and institutions, the trade volumes on global cryptocurrency platforms have been continually growing over the past few years, and so too has the range of trading products that further support crypto’s confident march onward.

Derivatives are an essential part of every market development cycle, with one of the key drivers of the crypto trading field being the derivatives trading segment. In today’s world, where Bitcoin is well recognized by major institutional investors and every third global company buys crypto, monthly trade volumes have reached hundreds of billions of dollars.

The primary crypto derivatives products include futures, options and swaps, mostly offered against the number one asset — Bitcoin. Crypto derivatives trading is popular among the crypto community, as it represents an option to manage risks efficiently and utilize leverage options to maximize profits at the same time.

With the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world and financial systems recovering from the shock, the crypto derivatives market started growing significantly, reaching an all-time high volume of $600 billion in March. Then, according to recent reports issued by CryptoCompare, crypto-backed derivatives trading of both perpetual swap and futures contracts reached another all-time high volume of $602 billion in May.

So, what’s the reason for such a massive surge in crypto derivatives trading during the last few months? Nothing unusual — it’s quite a natural phenomenon. Let’s compare the bond market and the stock market. In the stock market, one can potentially get higher returns at a greater risk compared with the bond market. The current economic crisis has meant it is more challenging to find relevant trends that would allow us to get better returns, as most trends clearly correlate with changes due to COVID-19. While the cryptocurrency market is still quite a Wild West and is extremely volatile, despite a growing maturity, many people simply search for a way to increase their activity with derivative instruments with a goal of higher profitability. As time passes, economies will start to recover, but then the balance may change again, and the demand for derivatives on cryptocurrencies may decrease. The volume will still remain large, but the growth rate will slow down.

Crypto derivatives market downsides

The advent of the crypto market product came unexpectedly, so Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering infrastructure and methodologies in most countries were not ready to ""digest"" the new paradigm according to which these new assets work. Putting it simply, the principles of transferring values from one owner to another in cryptocurrencies fundamentally differ from the ones underlying fiat money.

Secondly, the specifics associated with the issuance and governance of assets such as Bitcoin and other crypto tokens created difficulties with the identification and established responsibility between their issuers — which in some cases are absent — and tokenholders. Depending on the financial system’s stability, the nature of cryptocurrency creates financial and other risks and issues for each type of regulation. The vacuum in solving these issues is filled in different ways.

Speaking of the nature of cryptocurrency derivatives, the main types presented on the market today are contract for difference, or CFD; exchange for difference, or EFD; and Bitcoin futures. In the first two cases, it is a function of the value of the crypto asset but defined in financial instruments for which the regulatory framework already exists everywhere. It often contributes specifically to their development because when using derivatives by participants in the financial market, the logic of the existing KYC/AML procedures are not violated and the emission of crypto assets is not realized.

Therefore, the logic of regulatory processes remains in spite of the very close financial targets of derivatives use by market participants.

At the same time, unscrupulous market participants often take advantage of their clients’ low awareness, issuing derivative instruments for the underlying asset on which they are built. For example, this is what Revolut does: The British neobank’s customers cannot use cryptocurrency purchased through the platform outside of it. What people buy is not a cryptocurrency but rather a CFD on the cryptocurrency without the right to own these assets. It turns out that regulation does not protect clients since Revolut does not inform customers about the true nature of the offered services.

Is mainstream crypto derivatives adoption possible?

Generally, derivatives nowadays are a rather speculative instrument, with the only goal of producing a capital gain or loss requiring very little capital.

Classic examples of shifting old approaches into the new system will not happen, and despite the increasingly popular and record-breaking auction of derivatives, this is not what contributes to the adoption of cryptocurrency for its widespread use. All that we witness today is an intermediate stage, with these current companies and projects simply adapting themselves to the existing demand.

The technology will become mainstream with the emergence of products that possess specific qualities: being globally accepted, easy-to-use and with open source acting as a platform for any operations — from exchanging money to buying tickets and protecting information and privacy.

The infamous and highly anticipated TON initiative, which was abandoned by the Telegram team last month, could become such a project and shine a light into crypto ecosystems. However, having lost a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, this initiative has been transferred into users’ hands. Libra is becoming a potential contender, with Facebook most likely to start by allowing Libra users to pay for advertising services and buy goods on its marketplace. It may take more than a year to see the first results of mass adoption if Facebook finally succeeds in launching it.

It seems that cryptocurrency derivatives literally “slipped” through the regulatory meat grinder that many native cryptocurrencies and tokens had to go through. We know that derivatives are pretty popular in the U.S., Europe and the United Kingdom, as well as offshore zones. All of these jurisdictions do a great job of regulating these instruments.

As we dive further into the crypto world’s reality, more apps and products built around blockchain and cryptocurrencies are establishing ever more complex services and ecosystems. While still in regulatory uncertainty, blockchain-based ecosystems and global initiatives will help to unite people and establish a bridge to unbanked countries. With even institutions now investing in cryptocurrencies in a big way, a new kind of economy built upon the crypto foundation layer is becoming reality, and we are all helping to make it happen.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

There have been a lot of rumors surrounding PayPal this week. A report suggested that the online payments giant plans to allow hundreds of millions of users to buy and sell crypto directly. Job vacancies for crypto and blockchain experts have added fuel to the fire. PayPal is yet to confirm whether the reports are true — but if they are, it could be a landmark moment in Bitcoin’s quest to go mainstream. As you’d expect, some of crypto’s best-known names saw this as a bullish sign, and they renewed predictions of BTC rallying to $12,000. But some — such as Decred co-founder Jake Yocom-Piatt — are dubious about the rumors. He told Cointelegraph: “PayPal, specifically, is notorious for depriving its users of access to legitimately acquired funds on their platform with little to no justification. Users having their funds restricted in this fashion is something cryptocurrencies are designed to prevent, making this integration, if it is indeed in progress, an odd combination.”

It’s quite rare for the top story of the Financial Times to send shockwaves through the crypto sector — but this week, it has. Wirecard, the troubled fintech company which recently discovered a $2.1-billion hole in its finances, has opened insolvency proceedings. The company powers many of the crypto debit cards in the market, and it’s been struggling to keep up with its debt obligations. Earlier in the week, former CEO Markus Braun was arrested on suspicion of falsifying the embattled firm’s accounts — and was released on $5.6 million bail. Wirecard’s demise is already affecting crypto card users, and a subsidiary responsible for issuing these debit cards has been suspended by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. This has meant customers were unable to use them. Crypto.com, one of the companies that used Wirecard’s services, has stressed that its users’ assets are secure — and said funds will rapidly be credited back to crypto wallets. It is now looking for alternative solutions so the cards can be used again.

Saturday saw BTC fall under $9,000 to lows of $8,813 — but it seems buyers have been keen to purchase these dips. Mild pullbacks are common over the weekends as trading volume tends to thin. Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Perlman said the market is in a bit of a neutral zone after Friday’s $1.06 billion BTC futures and options expiry. He explained: “The options expiry did not have a meaningful impact as most of the call options were aimed at $10,000 or higher.” Other threats are on the horizon. There’s a strengthening correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. equities — fuelling fears that BTC is vulnerable to a price pullback. Some, like stock-to-flow model creator PlanB, believe this might not be a bad thing. He said: “I see it as good news. I would be really worried if all these trillions QE money would flow to stocks, bonds, real estate, gold... but not to Bitcoin.” Other crypto analysts are also optimistic. Popular trader SteveCrypt0 said: “We could go as low as 6300 or even dip to 6k and still be bullish. In fact, it would even be a healthy correction right into the golden pocket of the 0.618 Fib level.”

It’s finally over: Telegram and the SEC have reached a settlement. The encrypted messaging app has been in hot water after it raised $1.7 billion in an ICO for GRAM tokens, which the regulator said was an illegal securities sale. Now, Telegram is returning $1.2 billion to investors and has to pay an $18.5-million penalty. The company has already confirmed that the Telegram Open Network is dead in the water. Announcing that a conclusion had been reached, the SEC said: “New and innovative businesses are welcome to participate in our capital markets but they cannot do so in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.” Unfortunately, it’s not exactly clear how Telegram or other potential ICO issuers can actually appease the SEC at this point.

Simon Dedic, the co-founder of the crypto research house Blockfyre, has kicked a massive hornet’s nest — and it had the potential to upset a lot of people. In an inflammatory tweet, he said: “I will get some serious hate for that, but I stand by my opinion: $XRP, $BCH, $BSV, $LTC and $EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies.” He explained that the likes of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV and Litecoin are ultimately trying to be a “better Bitcoin” — and argues this simply isn’t necessary. He also criticized EOS and XRP for being centralized and called out Ripple for dumping billions of XRP tokens on a regular basis. Dedic believes the traceability platform VeChain as well as Tezos are far worthier of having a bigger market cap.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $9,141.43, Ether at $226.35 and XRP at $0.18. The total market cap is at $259,573,858,203.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Celsius, Quant and Ren. The top three altcoin losers of the week are SwissBorg, Flexacoin and Compound.

Most Memorable Quotations

“We could go as low as $6,300 or even dip to $6,000 and still be bullish.” SteveCrypt0, analyst

“If your Bitcoin bet pays off it will be cataclysmically destructive for the world. And that’ll have enormous consequences to many people we all know and care about who weren’t hedged in Bitcoin. And so you almost don’t want it to happen.” Chamath Palihapitiya, Social Capital CEO

“Grayscale *alone* has taken all BTC mined + 14,000 more BTC off the table since the halving.” Hodlonaut, Twitter user

“The recent increase in correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 could be the root of BTC’s current price volatility.” Marcel Pechman, Cointelegraph contributor

“Like I’ve been saying for months now, I have no reason to walk away from my prediction early in the year that Bitcoin is going to get stuck between $6,000 and $10,000 for the majority of this year.” Tone Vays, trader

“I will get some serious hate for that, but I stand by my opinion: $XRP, $BCH, $BSV, $LTC and $EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies.” Simon Dedic, Blockfyre co-founder

“The Digital Resistance movement doesn’t end with last week’s ceasefire in Russia. It is just getting started – and going global.” Pavel Durov, Telegram CEO

Prediction of the Week

With Bitcoin 95% correlated to the S&P 500 right now, it isn’t ideal that one analyst has warned that this stock market index could soon suffer a 400-point crash. For Tone Vays, the economic uncertainty brought on by the coronavirus is proof that we won’t be seeing a BTC bull run for some time yet. On the latest episode of his Trading Bitcoin YouTube series, Vays said: “Like I’ve been saying for months now, I have no reason to walk away from my prediction early in the year that Bitcoin is going to get stuck between $6,000 and $10,000 for the majority of this year.” If he’s right, we might have to wait a little while before BTC attempts to reach all-time highs once again.

FUD of the Week

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is shunning Bitcoin. A news website affiliated with the jihadist group has updated its donations page to say it no longer accepts BTC — and that financial contributions should be made in Monero instead. Monero is a privacy coin that makes it easier to obfuscate the senders and receivers of transactions. There has long been speculation that ISIS has substantial war chests hidden in Bitcoin, but according to the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, this doesn’t appear to be the case. Its research suggests that less than $10,000 was raised for terrorism through crypto.

A ransomware group says it is planning to auction over 1TB of data stolen from a major entertainment law firm. The REvil gang claims the contents show that some of the world’s best-known stars have been involved in sex scandals, drug use and treachery. Information about Nicki Minaj, LeBron James and Mariah Carey is apparently going to go under the hammer, with each dataset costing $600,000. Confidential files belonging to Universal and MTV are being sold for $1 million each. The gang left a warning for the law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks, saying: “You have a chance to stop that, and you know what to do.” Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow told Cointelegraph that it’s difficult to know whether REvil has damaging documents on celebrities, warning they “could simply be making a bogus claim in the hope of upping the amount that people will bid.”

The astronomical price performance of the Compound Governance Token (known as COMP for short) may have been orchestrated using derivatives, according to analysts. After initially changing hands for approximately $80 each on June 18, COMP quickly rallied 500% to post highs above $380 on June 21. News of a Coinbase listing may have helped to entice buyers. But since that high, COMP has shed more than a third of its value, and it’s now trading under $250. The founder of the crypto asset manager Carbono, Raul Marcos, tweeted: “Trading $COMP futures right now is a masterclass on market manipulation.”

Crypto market skeptics and speculators are concerned about 789,000 ETH that started moving four days ago last Wednesday. The transaction was recorded by Whale Alert, and the $187 million worth of ether stems from the Plustoken scammers.

On Wednesday, June 24, 2020, at approximately 9:46 a.m. (ET) the Plustoken scammers who have yet to be arrested, moved 789,534 ETH worth $187,847,550 USD at today’s exchange rates.

Cryptocurrency traders are concerned that this stash of ETH will be dumped on numerous digital currency spot markets. Additionally, the Plustoken scammers moved $67 million worth of EOS tokens two days before the 789,000 ETH transaction.

A number of crypto traders and organizations like Chainalysis and Cyphertrace have reported on the Plustoken scammers’ transactions.

Speculators have assumed that Plustoken coins that were dumped on spot markets caused the price of BTC to slide at the end of 2019. Plustoken scammers have been accused of fueling the March 12, 2020 dump often referred to as ‘Black Thursday.’

On March 9, 2020, crypto market observers witnessed 13,000 BTC sent to bitcoin mixers and crypto speculators assume the scammers are selling. Chainalysis said after March 12, that the organization didn’t believe the sell-off stemmed from Plustoken coins sold.

“In this case, we don’t believe Plustoken liquidations are responsible for bitcoin’s price drop. While Bitcoin did move from Plustoken addresses over the weekend, very little has gone to exchanges,” Chainalysis wrote.

The recent 789,000 ETH transaction may have been shuffled or obfuscated through a number of hops. The $187 million was split into 50 different addresses on the Ethereum network.

Findings stemming from Cyphertrace and Chainalysis have noted that the Plustoken scammers still own large amounts of ETH, BTC, EOS, and a few other types of digital assets. To this day, the scammers who are still at large, hold large swathes of these coins and no one is sure how they will be sold, but many suspect over-the-counter (OTC) operations.

The ETH address where the $187 million in ether was stored, still has $139.70 worth of ETH in the wallet today. 192 days ago, the wallet started with 10 ETH deposited, but 789,524.6 ETH was deposited immediately after.

On June 18, ETC Group and HANetf announced the listing of a new exchange-traded bitcoin investment vehicle – named Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto (BTCE) – on the Germany-based Xetra exchange.

But what exactly is BTCE?

And what potential impact could this new exchange-traded product have on the wider crypto market?

What Is BTCE?

In essence, BTCE is a new investment vehicle – akin to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). It tracks the price development of bitcoin (BTC) and claims to be the world’s first centrally cleared Bitcoin exchange-traded commodity (ETC).

The BTCE is 100% backed by “physical” bitcoin, trades on the Deutsche Börse’s Xetra exchange, and is denominated in euros.

It is also the first cryptocurrency ETC on HANetf’s white label exchange-traded product (ETP) platform, according to a press release shared by Xetra.

BitGo acts as the custodian for ETC Group and Deutsche Boerse’s Eurex Clearing service handles central clearing, which removes bilateral counterparty risk for BTCE investors.

ETC Group CEO Bradley Duke, said,

“BTCE brings the transparency and investor protection that regulators and institutional investors require to the world of bitcoin. Investors get the benefits of trading and owning bitcoin through a regulated security, while having the optionality of redeeming bitcoin if they choose.”

Michael Krogmann, a board member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, stated,

“With the new product, investors can easily participate in the performance of the Bitcoin price without having to use unregulated crypto-trading platforms. Separate infrastructure, such as a crypto wallet, is not required.”

He added,

""With the world's first centrally cleared bitcoin ETN, we are also setting new standards in the post-trade processing of products on cryptocurrencies.”

What Impact Can We Expect?

Those expecting a major splash in bitcoin prices following the announcement of the new BTCE product will have been disappointed, as the market was largely unmoved by the news. Some, however, expected no less.

While the BTCE is effectively a bitcoin ETF, it is primarily targeted at retail investors and is currently only available in Germany, Austria, Italy and the United Kingdom.

That means larger Wall Street investment firms that would be expected to pile into a United States-based Bitcoin ETF (and thus drive up the price of bitcoin), will not be investing in the Xetra-listed BTCE.

While the United Kingdom and Germany have substantial retail investor bases, many investors in both nations already have direct exposure to bitcoin. And buying bitcoin through a bitcoin app is, generally speaking, easier than signing up for an online brokerage account to buy securities.

The BTCE also comes with a 2% annual fee, which makes it more expensive to hold exchange-traded bitcoin than physical bitcoin.

However, in exchange for that fee, investors do get a lot of benefits. For a start, they do not need to manage their own private keys or handle any of the other technical aspects typically associated with buying and storing bitcoin.

Additionally, the BTCE is regulated and centrally cleared, which reduces the risk of losing money due to outside factors, such as exchange hacks or counterparty disruptions.

Therefore, we will likely see demand for this new bitcoin product rise.

That said, at this stage, there is unlikely to be enough interest in the product to move BTC prices in any meaningful way. Regardless, if more products like this were to roll out elsewhere, that could change quickly.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/69777/crypto-exchanges-lead-the-way-for-blockchain-industry-ma-deals-research,"Since 2013, the blockchain industry has seen 129 M&A transactions, with an aggregate deal value around $2.9 billion per The Block's research findings.

Paxful users reportedly traded almost $39.8 million worth of Bitcoin (globally) during the week that ended June 6, 2020. Meanwhile, LocalBitcoins reported around $39.5 million in BTC trading volume during the same period.

Kimberly Beth Watson, who works in Compliance at Paxful, says:

“In the most unequal societies in the world, a product with the capacity to ignite and inspire self-empowerment is priceless. I work for Paxful because I’m surrounded by forward-thinking colleagues who lean into big challenges, where autonomy is respected and hard work is recognized.”

An official blog post by Paxful notes that the global Fintech industry continues to grow and evolve rapidly. There are many aspects and parts of the financial technology sector, including the “very complex world of cryptocurrencies,” the Paxful team notes.

They add:

“Through communities, people with the same interests can exchange their ideas and knowledge with members from different parts of the world.”

They also mentioned:

“For marketplaces and exchanges, building a community will never be a bad idea when governed and run properly. … joining a Bitcoin community or of whatever currency can give you a proper idea about how things work….”

According to Chainalysis, Paxful is “considered to be one of the safest P2P cryptocurrency exchanges.” They claim that Paxful offers a good example of a tiered Know Your Customer (KYC) policy (more details here).

Is now the time to invest in digital currencies?

As the Covid-19 crisis continues to disrupt global markets, is it time to hedge Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and other digital assets?

The economic effects of Covid-19 have sent investors in search of assets that can offer shelter during the storm and a hedge against macro events. Against a backdrop of shrinking GDP, economic slowdown, government bailouts, and fiscal stimulus aka money printing, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been touted as an inflation-resistant hedge.

Not beholden to the whims of any political leader or global superpower, crypto assets are defined by their fixed, knowable, and verifiable supply. They cannot be debased or flooded into the economy to prop up failing institutions, or used to enrich the 1% at the expense of the other 99. But are these qualities enough to make bitcoin and its sister assets capable of serving as a hedge? And if so, how can you increase your exposure to bitcoin while taking steps to mitigate any downside risk?

The case for investing in Bitcoin

The case for investing in bitcoin is the same as that of any asset: you believe that demand for it is likely to increase in the months and years to come, leading to a corresponding increase in price. This will enable you to sell the asset for more than you paid for it. But if this thesis holds true, what is it about bitcoin that’s likely to make its “number go up” as crypto traders jokingly refer to it?

There are many reasons why bitcoin is viewed as an attractive investment and hedge against traditional investments. While the S&P 500 is down 7% for the year to date, Bitcoin is up 24%.

Renowned investor Paul Tudor Jones has called bitcoin “a great speculation,” and said it reminds him of gold in the 1970s. “Every day that goes by that Bitcoin survives, the trust in it will go up,” noted Jones, who now has around 2% of his wealth in bitcoin.

Former Goldman Sachs Fund Manager Raoul Pal, meanwhile, has moved 25% of his portfolio to Bitcoin following the Covid-19 crisis. Institutional interest in bitcoin is increasing and 80% of institutional investors now see the appeal of digital assets.

And then there’s the on-chain data that paints a rosy picture of bitcoin’s future, based on metrics such as holding patterns, transaction volume, and the amount of BTC withdrawn from exchanges for long-term storage. Respected bitcoin analyst Willy Woo estimates that BTC is less than a month away from embarking on its next bull run, based on market and on-chain data.

Finally, Bitcoin’s supply reduces over time because the number of new coins issued to miners is halved every four years. As a result, Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow, which denotes the number of years, at the current production rate, required to achieve the current supply, is increasing. Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow now stands at 50 (years), placing it close to gold.

The case for investing in other digital assets

Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency on the market of course. In fact there are thousands of digital assets, though only a handful of these warrant consideration as an investment and potential hedge. For example, if you believe that the future of finance lies in private transactions and fungible digital cash, you may see value in monero (XMR). If you believe that open finance enforced by smart contracts will be a major growth area, you may wish to invest in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The smaller the market capitalisation of the crypto asset you are investing in, the higher the risk is likely to be — but the higher the potential upside too. Thus, it is imperative that you understand the cryptocurrency you are considering, and its function within the blockchain network it powers.

For example, decentralised finance projects such as Compound and Balancer enable token-holders to earn yield for staking assets and providing liquidity. Yield-bearing crypto assets — in this case COMP and BAL — sound attractive, but they call for deep knowledge of how their respective protocols work, and are not for casual investors.

For investors seeking alpha within the crypto sector, there is no shortage of opportunities. Bear in mind, however, that crypto assets remain highly correlated to bitcoin, and are thus dependent in part on how it performs. When BTC is in a bull market, it typically pulls the rest of the market up with it, and vice-versa.

Where to buy Bitcoin

Buying bitcoin is a quick process these days, thanks to an array of consumer-friendly apps and websites that eliminate the complexity. Platforms like Skrill have soaked up a slice of the consumer buy-side action, enabling crypto to be bought with dozens of fiat currencies and deposit methods.

Skrill’s reputation as a trusted digital payment processor has aided its diversification into cryptocurrency, while the ability to place automated orders at particular price points enables buyers to enter the market if and when BTC reaches their desired price target.

While Skrill also allows BTC to be swapped for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash, EOS, ether, ethereum classic, and litecoin, investors seeking to actively trade digital assets should consider doing so on a dedicated exchange.

Many of the most popular exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase have fiat on-ramps, allowing investors to purchase crypto using debit card or bank transfer, and then trade in and out of stablecoins and cryptos on the exchange.

No hedge is perfect

Bitcoin and other cryptos aren’t entirely disassociated from the broader financial market. In a cash crisis, for example, investors will sell off their most liquid assets and thus BTC may be one of the first candidates to be off-loaded.

What bitcoin does provide, however, is an investment option whose design, transparency, issuance, and transferability stand in stark contrast to the traditional financial system. Shrewd investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to bitcoin, and then increasing it as BTC demonstrates its ability to serve as an economic hedge.

Bitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency by market value. Not only is it used as the base currency of choice for trading smaller digital assets, it is also less vulnerable to manipulation or sudden price swings compared to altcoins, most of which are based on Ethereum’s blockchain.

However, that pricing situation may change during the third quarter, according to options market data.

The spread between the three-month at-the-money implied volatility for Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token and bitcoin pair, a measure of expected volatility between the two, fell to a record low of -2.4% on Sunday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

“The negative spread shows the options market expects bitcoin to be more volatile than ether over the next three months,” said Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh.

The spread clocked a record high of 33% in February and has been on a declining trend ever since.

Implied volatility, which is computed using the prices of options and underlying assets and other key metrics, represents investors’ expectations of how volatile or risky an asset would be over a specific period. Implied volatility is a way to quantify uncertainty

“The fact that markets are now factoring in higher bitcoin price volatility compared to ether is surprising given the focus on the Ethereum-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector over the past one month,” said Goh.

According to data provider DeFiPulse, the number of ether locked into DeFi applications has increased from 2.539 million on June 16 to 3.087 million on June 29. That’s a growth of more than 20% in 13 days. During the same period, the dollar value of various tokens locked has surged from $1 billion to $1.62 billion. Note that out of the 205 DeFi projects listed on DeFiPulse, 192 are built on Ethereum.

The activity picked up the pace after lending protocol Compound’s COMP token went live for trading on June 18. The governance token rose by 500% in the following three days, triggering a frenzy in the DeFi space.

The market is divided on whether the DeFi explosion will lead to a sustained rally in ether or lead to a boom-bust cycle. “DeFi will likely help push ETH to $1 trillion market cap,” Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital, tweeted on June 16.

Meanwhile, BlockTower’s CIO Ari Paul put out a tweet thread on June 21 explaining the possibility of liquidity mining fueling a bubble in the DeFi space. Liquidity mining refers to giving out governance tokens to put assets into a lending/borrowing protocol.

As such, one may expect ether to be more volatile than bitcoin, especially with bitcoin-related news having dried up following the cryptocurrency’s third mining reward halving, which took place on May 12.

While the options market suggests otherwise, the possibility of bitcoin witnessing greater volatility cannot be ruled out. The top cryptocurrency has spent nearly two months trading in the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000.

In the June 2020 edition of the Crypto Research Report, researchers predicted the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins — Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Stellar (XLM) — would get a huge surge before 2025, which may continue for at least five years.

“We believe that Bitcoin is still at the very start of its adoption curve,” the report states. “The price of $7,200 at the end of 2019 suggests that Bitcoin has penetrated less than 0.44% of its total addressable markets [worth $212 trillion]. If this penetration manages to reach 10%, its non-discounted utility price should reach nearly $400,000.”

Source: Crypto Research Report

That would mean a price increase of more than 4,000% for BTC by 2030, but ETH, LTC and BCH are also looking bullish in this scenario, with surges of roughly 1,600%, 5,000% and 5,400%, respectively. However, XLM would see the largest increase: more than 11,000% from $0.07 to $7.81.

‏‏The ‎Liechtenstein-based research group analyzed cryptocurrencies based on their target addressable market, or TAM, a metric used “to estimate a cryptoasset’s implied future price.” According to the report, TAMs for cryptocurrencies include remittance, tax evasion, offshore accounts, store of value, online transactions, micropayments, crypto trading, gaming, online gambling, consumer loans, reserve currency and others.

‏On-chain velocity decreasing, off-chain increasing

The report also observed on- and off-chain velocity metrics for altcoins and concluded that the “growth in the number of speculative transactions on exchanges is faster than growth of utility transactions to buy goods and services.”

“On-chain velocity” is a metric measured by transactions on a blockchain, while “off-chain velocity” is determined by trading activity on crypto exchanges. When analyzing Bitcoin, the researchers noted the price of the cryptocurrency and its activity on exchanges both increased at roughly the same time:

“If cryptocurrencies gain adoption for long-term hoarding purposes or for short-term spending on speculation or coffees, the price of crypto assets will go up,” the Crypto Research Report stated. “High velocity on-chain and low velocity off-chain suggests that crypto assets are becoming increasingly used for speculation and not for store of value.”

This could signal that investors have given up expectations of a price decoupling, or they simply expect ETH price moves to mirror Bitcoin.

In the case of potential catalysts for significant price moves, implied volatility tends to move up whereas an absence of triggers causes volatility to recede, alongside a diminishing premium on options markets.

The above chart shows a continuous drop on both assets’ volatility, which can be partially explained by the Bitcoin halving in mid-May. At the time, investors had reasons to believe prices could oscillate more drastically as the possibility of various miner capitulations loomed.

At the same time, positive news from strong inflows by Grayscale Investments, advancements on the Ethereum 2.0 testnet, and a growing DeFi ecosystem boosted traders' expectations.

Crypto markets remain relatively volatile

Volatility within the crypto market remains well above the level seen in the S&P 500 and that should be no surprise.

There are a handful of reasons behind this difference and some of the more notable ones are: the enormous untapped potential of digital assets and existing uncertainties related to the necessary evolution of various protocols.

Ether options markets point to bearish sentiment

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's put/call options ratio tells a different story as put (bearish) options total 40% of the current open interest which is down from an 80% pre-halving peak .

This shouldn't be interpreted as a bull/bear indicator by itself as it depends on the strike levels those options have been set at.

Longer-term Ether options are bullish

Longer-term ETH options are curiously more active than next month's contract and that's a stark difference from the BTC markets.

Although it is impossible to pinpoint the exact reason, one might infer that the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 development is behind this.

Although it might seem that the ETH put/call ratio is balanced, when analyzing strikes for the slightly optimist calls ($240 to $280) to the slightly negative puts ($180 to $220) there's a clear imbalance of 2:1 favoring bullish calls.

The same pattern emerges for the September 2020 expiry.

Short-term Ether options are bearish

Oddly enough, for the July 2020 ETH contract, there's an impressive 4:1 ratio favoring put options (bearish) close to current market levels.

This shows investors are taking advantage of the recent volatility downtrend to create strategies that protect against short-term downside, while also aiming for call options (bullish) year-end.

Data from Skew indicates that although premium remains healthy at 2%, the excessive optimism seen earlier this month has vanished.

The 20-day correlation between Bitcoin and Ether recently climbed back to 0.90 levels, indicating prices of both assets have been moving quite similarly. This partially explains declining ETH options implied volatility as investors adapt to high-correlation markets.

Main takeaways

Ether’s current low volatility indicates that options markets do not expect any critical catalysts for either bull or bear cases. Short-term options show intense bearish activity, while September and December markets are skewed for the call options (bullish).

Low volatility does not imply that investors expect a price upswing or downswing, it simply reflects reduced expectations of major price catalysts. As reported by Cointelegraph, there have been a couple of bullish indicators for Ether, including increasing user activity and surging institutional demand.

For those willing to benefit from the potential upside of Ethereum 2.0, this is an excellent opportunity to buy longer-term call options.

Low volatility translates to reduced costs for buying options contracts, which, unlike futures markets, provides a way to keep open positions despite short term negative price swings.

You should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-volatility-trends,"By this stage, pretty much everyone knows that bitcoin’s volatility is well above that of equity markets. This is still true, even after the ructions of March.

What is less well-known is the balance of power when it comes to volatility is shifting. Market data indicates bitcoin markets are becoming less volatile, and equity markets more so. This seems to be unrelated to the crash in markets earlier this year.

Of course, it’s possible this trend turns again. On the other hand, it could point to a broadening interest in bitcoin as an investment asset, as well as a new role for the cryptocurrency in portfolios.

Let’s look at the details.

It’s all relative

First, bitcoin’s volatility is currently below its 2019 average. Not so for the equity markets.

Source: Coin Metrics, FactSet

(Note: We calculate volatility by annualizing 30-day standard deviations. This smooths variations while still reflecting short-term trends and, as of mid-April, removes the effects of the March crash.)

Over the past month, BTC volatility has continued trending down, while S&P volatility has levelled off.

Source: Coin Metrics, FactSet

This could be a short-term anomaly. Or it could mean the “standard” expected S&P 500 volatility is now at higher levels than before, while bitcoin’s is lower.

The VIX index, which measures expected S&P 500 volatility using options prices, is currently almost three times higher than at the beginning of the year.

Source: FactSet

Second, this shift is supported by activity in traditional market volatility instruments. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on data from Cboe Global Markets data that showed more than a trillion dollars’ worth of derivatives tied to the VIX has traded this year, more than four times the figure a decade ago. It also cited figures from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research that points to a record $19.4 billion of assets in hedge funds that trade volatility.

And earlier this week, the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded notes (VXX) – the largest volatility ETN by far – had its second-largest daily inflow ever.

It doesn’t matter any more

When Fidelity Digital Assets released its survey earlier this month, in which institutional investors were asked about the barriers to investment in crypto assets, volatility was top of the list.

With the narrowing of the differential, that barrier could disappear or at least significantly diminish. It’s not just that bitcoin’s volatility seems to be trending down – if volatility overall is more acceptable, bitcoin’s swings could be seen as less of a negative.

Indeed, many of today’s crypto investors see the heightened volatility as an advantage. Where else are you going to get high potential returns?

What’s more, the strong growth in crypto derivatives gives professional investors more tools with which to hedge the volatility. The breadth of instruments available to crypto investors of all types is steadily widening, and the volume of open interest in bitcoin options heading into Friday’s expiry was more than six times its level at the beginning of the year.

In crypto as in traditional markets, options are not just used for hedging, they are also used to trade volatility, a further sign of the growing interest in the strategy.

Or does it?

Stepping back, it is curious something that used to be a performance metric is now an investment philosophy. Volatility has moved from the realm of statistics to the realm of strategy.

But now there’s an even bigger shift under way.

Volatility has traditionally been equated with risk. This makes sense – the greater the swings, the greater the chance you lose a lot.

But volatility is not the same as risk, it’s a historical performance metric. True, expected volatility derived from options pricing looks forward, but that measurement is based on data points that don’t claim to actually know what future volatility will be, let alone future risk. Especially in these uncertain times, where bad news lurks around every corner and capital flows can swell across oceans in nanoseconds, we may know what the volatility was yesterday and what is expected tomorrow, but we do not know what the actual risk is.

The more we attempt to quantify risk and to harness it for portfolio improvement, the more we lose touch with what it really means. And the more we actively seek it, the more it could spread throughout the system, introducing a systemic weakness that could hurt many.

The cryptocurrency world has long embraced risk. Ferocious creativity and the potential for staggering loss have been part of the DNA of the industry since the beginning. In other words, long-term crypto investors are used to this, and anyone who comes into the sector hopefully does so with his or her eyes open.

In regulated traditional markets, however, volatility is still a relatively misunderstood phenomenon, especially in these untethered markets. It may be creeping into the general vocabulary, and may even become a more entrenched aspect of portfolio construction. But most of those handling it do not have the experience of more-seasoned traders.

Yet, volatility is not a bad thing. In this low-yield environment, it can produce necessary returns unavailable in low-volatility alternatives. Managed with skill, it can provide the outperformance many fund managers need. And with the right tools, it can form a part of even conservative investment strategies.

Changing roles

This could influence the role crypto assets have in broad portfolios. One of the prevailing narratives of recent times has been bitcoin’s role as a hedge against market risk. If things go badly in the economy and the stock market, the reasoning goes, bitcoin will benefit from being seen as an alternative to a wobbly fiat system.

Yet, so far this year we have seen that narrative falter when faced with general turmoil and uncertainty.

Perhaps a new narrative is emerging. Bitcoin is volatile, yes, but so are a lot of other more mainstream investments that populate even conservative portfolios. And the volatility differential seems to be narrowing; this might continue. If so, bitcoin could become less a market hedge and more a volatility diversifier. As more investors embrace volatility, they will hopefully do so with a variety of tools.

You’ll have heard the saying: “They can pull the carpet out from under your feet, or you can learn to dance on a moving carpet.”

Anyone know what's going on yet?

The relentless and alarming climb in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and elsewhere seems to have spooked the markets a bit this week … but just a bit. The threat of walking back the tentative reopening enjoyed in some areas is denting confidence in the consumption recovery that the market was bewilderingly assuming was just around the corner. On the other hand, there’s a lot of fresh money apparently waiting in the wings, and it has to go somewhere.

As we’re pulling out our alphabets to get a handle on what’s ahead, what do you think: a V, a W, a swoosh or a flipped square root sign? I personally favor the ampersand. It feels less linear.

True to recent form, bitcoin acted like a risk-on asset this week, reflecting broader market skittishness by almost twice breaking its monthly lows. Meanwhile, correlation with the S&P 500 is, well, not exactly stable.

As the chess pieces move around the board of financial regulation and prosecution, various possible scenarios are playing out. One is especially intriguing: If current chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton, is confirmed to become the new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, President Trump will likely appoint one of the remaining SEC commissioners as acting chair until Clayton’s successor is confirmed. This could well be Hester Peirce, known for her pro-innovation stance on crypto oversight and for her public dissent on the dismissal of a recent bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal. TAKEAWAY: This is all in the realm of speculation, but it could end up being a significant turning point in crypto regulation.

The European Union is preparing a new regulatory regime that could include stricter requirements for crypto assets, including stablecoins. TAKEAWAY: Greater regulation is resisted by many in the crypto industry as it can stifle innovation. Most investors would welcome it, however, as it brings greater clarity and acceptance. And, let’s face it, it’s inevitable as cryptocurrencies grow in popularity. The increased attention from the regulators of one of the world’s principal economic blocs is a strong sign that crypto assets are being taken seriously at the highest levels.

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) will consider issuing conditional licenses under which startups would be allowed to partner with existing licensed entities to begin operations in the Empire State, and it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the State University of New York allowing fledgling prospective licensees to experiment with use cases under the school’s supervision. TAKEAWAY: This is a significant change for the BitLicense regime, long criticized for being too onerous and restrictive. More importantly, this shift could usher in a new season of innovative crypto services in one of the world’s largest financial centers.

Commodity markets veteran Chris Hehmeyer, CEO of Hehmeyer Trading + Investments, is rebranding his firm to reflect its growing involvement in the crypto markets. TAKEAWAY: This is significant: Hehmeyer Trading has been a fixture of the commodities trading scene since 2007, and the pivot of such a legacy name into crypto markets sends a signal to other traders that this is where the “new” markets are. Hehmeyer has been trading crypto assets for a couple of years now, and has spoken publicly about them on several occasions, but this marks a deeper commitment to the evolution of the industry.

According to sources, PayPal plans to roll out cryptocurrency buying and selling to its 325 million users, possibly within the next three months. TAKEAWAY: The numbers alone point to how big the impact could be. PayPal’s user base is almost as large as the entire population of the United States. What is even more intriguing are the possible reasons for PayPal’s strategy shift. Could it be the significant revenue competitor Square is earning on its crypto platform?

LibertyX plans to enable cash purchases of bitcoin at 20,000 locations, including at 7-Eleven, CVS and Rite Aid stores. And Australians can now purchase bitcoin at post offices. TAKEAWAY: This significant jump in the number of onramps does not necessarily mean that retail investors will start buying bitcoin in droves; it does, however, make it a lot easier for those that want to try it out with small amounts. Going even further, just seeing the purchase points at highly frequented and trusted retail sites is likely to entrench the public’s awareness of bitcoin, and acceptance of its legitimacy.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp shared some charts framing bitcoin’s role as a store of value. TAKEAWAY: Is bitcoin a store of value? There’s data for and there’s data against. The most compelling data against is bitcoin’s lack of correlation with gold. Is that the right metric to look at?

Coin Metrics looked into whether Coinbase’s announcements of possible listings has an impact on the asset prices. The outcome? Less than you would expect. TAKEAWAY: I have questioned this practice before. Surely an announcement of a potential listing, something that might increase liquidity of an asset (and therefore, in theory, its value), can be construed as price manipulation? Coin Metrics showed the price movements after announcements of potential listings is largely influenced by the market mood at the time.

Kaiko took a close look at bitcoin options market metrics, concluding that the options market has recently showed clear signs of maturity in terms of costs and trading behavior. TAKEAWAY: The recent growth in open interest and trading volumes in bitcoin options has attracted attention from market participants, who see it as a symptom of greater crypto market maturity overall. It is also a sign of deeper professional involvement, as heavy options volumes are a sign of deep pockets and high stakes. Also, more options products are coming to market, which should continue to enhance investor demand as the array of potential use cases and configurations broadens.

The net flow of bitcoins into miner addresses dropped on Tuesday into sharply negative territory, according to crypto data source Glassnode, reaching the lowest level since June 2019. Another metric shows that nearly all of the net outflow was to exchanges, which some are interpreting a bearish signal, given the accumulating sell pressure. TAKEAWAY: On the other hand, miners usually only sell when they believe the market can handle the orders. Furthermore, miners traditionally use OTC traders to move large blocks, so there may be something else going on here. And, as the chart shows, strong net outflows don’t always presage price dips. But, given that volumes are relatively low compared to previous weeks, this is worth keeping an eye on.

Barça Fan Tokens, listed as $BAR, went on sale on Monday, and reached its cap of $1.3 million within two hours. TAKEAWAY: This is more significant than it may seem. I’ve written before about how soccer club tokens can be a gateway into asset innovation for a mainstream audience – this news shows that where there is genuine interest, the underlying technology will not be a barrier. I doubt very much that the buyers were mainly crypto enthusiasts.

Antonopoulos, who mainly supports developments related to the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, argued that DeFi is one of the few ways to earn a passive income without having to “give your money to other people.”

Antonopoulos, who has authored many best-selling books including Mastering Ethereum, said that Bitcoin holders may retain custody of their coins while earning passively via so-called DeFi platforms.

Antonopoulos, whose comments came during a recent livestream Q&A uploaded to his YouTube channel (on June 27, 2020), pointed out that Bitcoin investors could convert their holdings into Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoin like Dai (DAI). These funds could then be loaned out on a DeFi platform, where they’d be able to earn interest on their loans.

But Antonopoulos also cautioned that conducting these types of trades on Ethereum-powered DeFi networks was quite risky. This, as there are serious issues which have been found in smart contracts (in their source code), which has led to numerous hacks.

Antonopoulos warned:

“Ethereum may have problems. It may have bugs. The consensus algorithm may have failures. You may have increases in the gas price, which leads to other cascade problems. And all of those things can cause you to lose some or all of your invested capital.”

Borrowing and lending crypto-assets is also risky because their prices are highly volatile. Many digital currency-backed loans are also used for margin trading, which makes them even riskier. The volume of these types of loans crossed $8 billion in 2019, and they could attract even more investors in the future.

Antonopoulos pointed out that there are many people who are holding Bitcoin on a long-term basis (called “HODLers”). However, he noted that there’s no guarantee that BTC price will rise. He said that “what goes up, can come down.”

He also mentioned:

“You can pull your Bitcoin out and convert it, buy 1,000 altcoins (alternative coins), and then watch them crash by 98%.”

This actually happened to many speculative investors during the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of late 2017 and early 2018. Not only did altcoin prices crash by over 99% in many cases, most of them were also scams.

Jason Calacanis, a well-known angel investor who has been involved with Uber and Robinhood, recently noted via Twitter that 99% of altcoins are “garbage” that have been issued by unqualified entities.

However, Calcancis (like many others) has argued that there’s still hope for maybe 1% of altcoin projects, which he claims could change the world.

Calcancis tweeted:",2020-06-16 00:00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/163381-bitcoin-mercantile-exchange-introduces-corporate-accounts-with-enhanced-security-and-improved-accounting-features/,"The Hong Kong operated Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX), the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, is introducing a program that will reportedly offer special benefits to corporate clients – which may include improved security and accounting services.

As mentioned on BitMEX’s website:

“The BitMEX Corporate account program is a set of features and services designed to better serve our ever-growing segment of corporate customers. ‘Corporate’ accounts are simply the part of our customer base where the account owner is not an individual, but a company or other legal entity, and as such need different ownership structures for their accounts.”

The Corporate account will also provide ways for employees to easily access and better manage their accounts.

The new accounts will offer an improved Corporate legal structure, which will ensure that users’ accounts are the legal property of their Corporate Entity, and not an employee or individual.

Additionally, the accounts will provide “enhanced service” through dedicated client coverage relationship managers and regular access to global corporate events.

The new accounts will offer “enhanced security,” including more options for “defining account access and control via authorized signatories and dedicated account management.” Improved auditing features will be available as well.

At time of writing (10:00 UTC), bitcoin is trading around $9,170, representing a 27.8% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Meanwhile, gold and the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, are reporting 16% and 5.4% gains for 2020, respectively. The S&P 500 index and oil prices are in the red YTD at -5.5% and -34.22%, respectively, as per data source Skew.

At press time, bitcoin is down over 3% from the opening price of $9,444 observed on June 1, having rallied by 34% and 9.5% in April and May, respectively.

“We are in a post-halving price action lull, but investor and on-chain activity has been strong,” said Kyle Davies, co-founder and chairman at Three Arrows Capital.

Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving on May 11. The event was expected by some to accelerate price gains; however, strong buying pressure has remained elusive so far, with the cryptocurrency restricted largely to the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000 since mid May.

Investors, however, continue to pour money into bitcoin-based exchange-traded instruments like Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest by assets under management (AUM).

“Grayscale saw record subscriptions of 19,000 bitcoin in the latest 2 week period ending 24-Jun,” said Davies, whose firm is the biggest public shareholder in GBTC. In May, the trust accumulated 1.5 times the total of coins mined since the May 11 halving.

Grayscale is a fully owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent firm.

HODLing growth

Onchain metrics are also painting a long-term bullish picture. For instance, the percent of bitcoin’s circulating supply that has not moved in at least 12 months reached a record high of 61.59% on Monday. The figure surpasses the previous lifetime high of 61.13% seen in January 2016, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

Source: Glassnode

“The data shows that we are in a period of sustained HODLing. The last time the number of coins last active 1+ years ago exceeded 60% was in early 2016, just before the price started increasing ever-more-rapidly leading up to the bull run to $20K,” analysts at Glassnode said in a weekly analysis.

Other on-chain activity is also picking up pace due to the recent explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). “Bitcoin tokenized on Ethereum has passed 11,000 (more than $100 million) and fees on Ethereum’s network have reached record highs due to increased tether and Defi transactions,” said Davies. “This will eventually impact market prices.”

While investor flows and on-chain metrics are supportive of stronger gains in bitcoin, seasonal patterns favor a minor correction.

Bitcoin quarterly returns Source: Skew

As can be seen, bitcoin has posted losses in the third quarter in four out of the last six years. On most occasions, the negative third-quarter performance is preceded by stellar gains in the April to June period.",2020-06-30 10:41:14+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/163384-heres-why-ethereum-tezos-stellar-chainlink-are-not-yet-legitimate-bitcoin-btc-investment-alternatives/,"Feyyaz Alingan, the Founder of Blue Alpine Research, a Switzerland-based research firm focused on digital assets, has pointed out several “alternatives” to Bitcoin (BTC).

Alingan, an electrical engineering graduate from ETH Zürich, says that Ethereum (ETH) may be considered a Bitcoin alternative. He notes that Ethereum’s founders, including Vitalik Buterin, felt that the Bitcoin protocol’s “lack of programmability” was one of its downsides or disadvantages.

That’s why they reintroduced smart contracts (or programmable business logic). It’s worth noting that smart contracts weren’t “invented” by Ethereum founders. They were actually first proposed by renowned cryptographer and self-taught legal expert Nick Szabo in the 1990s.

Alingan writes that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum have several issues including their high energy usage (because they use proof of work consensus). Both leading blockchain networks are also plagued with scalability issues, which means they’re only able to process between 5 to 15 transactions per second.

Alingan argues that Bitcoin and Ethereum are now “making room for different interesting altcoins (alternative coins) that allow increased speed and scalability” while using different types of consensus algorithms such as proof of stake, delegated proof of stake (DPoS), and many others.

According to Alingan, Stellar Lumens (XLM), Tezos (XTZ), 0x (ZRX), EOS (EOS), and Chainlink (LINK) may be considered Bitcoin alternatives – at least when it comes to diversifying a digital asset investment portfolio.

Stellar, an Alternative to Bitcoin?

Stellar (XLM) is a peer to peer (P2P) digital currency with a market cap of over $262 million, making it the 15th largest crypto-asset (according to CoinGecko data).

Last month, London-based SatoshiPay, a Fintech firm that aims to provide fast and affordable payment solutions, partnered with the San Francisco-headquartered Stellar Development Foundation (SDF).

SatoshiPay received a $550,000 investment from SDF’s Enterprise Fund. The funds will be used to support the Fintech firm’s future growth and product development.

Established in 2014 with offices in London and Berlin, SatoshiPay is reportedly one of the earliest adopters of the Stellar (XLM) platform.

Stellar is now one of the most widely-adopted crypto-assets, and even the popular Blockchain.com wallet added support for it. The wallet only supports a few other assets, which includes Bitcon, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and the Paxos Standard Token.

However, Stellar still cannot serve as an alternative or replacement for Bitcoin (BTC) because it doesn’t have nearly the same network effect – meaning that the BTC network regularly processes billions of dollars in transactions per day while Stellar is handling less than $500 million every 24 hours. The BTC network has also been running without major technical issues since its genesis block was mined in 2009.

Meanwhile, the Stellar Network went down last year due to technical issues. The Stellar team claimed that the DLT-based platform went offline due to its nodes not being able to reach consensus. The developers of Stellar have introduced more features and functionality on the network, including the ability to issue tokens and create decentralized applications (dApps).

The core Bitcoin protocol doesn’t have these extra features, but it does one thing and does it really well. The BTC network was designed specifically to transfer value in a permissionless, decentralized manner. And, it’s been able to do that really well for over a decade, and no other DLT platform has been able to do that consistently for so long – while also onboarding a relatively large number of users (more merchants accept/recognize BTC than all others cryptos).

Chainlink and 0x (ZRX) Experiencing Increased Adoption, but are they Good Investments?

Earlier this month, Bamboo Relay, a 0x relayer, confirmed that it had integrated Chainlink Oracles for stop-loss order functionalities.

A stop-loss order allows users to provide specific instructions about when to buy or sell a stock or in this case cryptocurrency tokens. The tokens may be bought or sold when they reach a certain price, referred to as the “stop price.” If and when the stop price is reached, the stop order is converted into an actual market order and is executed as soon as possible.

0x is an open-source protocol for decentralized or non-custodial digital asset exchanges that has been implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a standard messaging format and a set of smart contracts that are used to conduct transactions after specific conditions have been met.

Many cryptocurrency protocols are now using both Chainlink and 0x. There’s no denying that these two projects are useful, especially Chainlink as it aims to address smart contract security issues which have led to many hacks and other technical problems. However, they’re not really Bitcoin alternatives because they’re completely different from Bitcoin.

0x is a protocol for implementing decentralized exchanges, while Chainlink enables secure communication on DLT networks. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a way to facilitate decentralized value transfer. Because of these fundamental differences, these platforms are not alternatives or replacements for each other.

Even if we look at it from purely an investment point of view, we are investing in fundamentally different types of assets which may have their own unique addressable markets in the future. So, in their present form, they might be able to complement each other (at best), but not be replacements for each other.

EOS Is Two Years Old, but Still in Early Stages of Adoption

Brendan Blumer, CEO at Block.one, the developer of EOS, a leading platform for building decentralized applications (dApps), reminded his social media followers on June 2, 2020, that it’s now been two years since the EOS mainnet went live (during the summer months of 2018).

Last year, in June, Block.one announced Voice, a blockchain-powered social media platform that’s currently in its beta stages.

The company also introduced several other initiatives like Coinbase Learn. In July 2019, the EOS software, EOSIO 1.8, went through a hard fork or backward-incompatible upgrade.

EOS has seen steady development and adoption, however, it’s still in its early stages so it’s not mature enough as a blockchain network to be considered an alternative to Bitcoin. EOS is also a lot more complex than Bitcoin because its developers have launched it so that it can be used to deploy decentralized applications (dApps).

The core Bitcoin protocol only aims to transfer digital value, and doesn’t have such demanding design goals. Because of its simplicity and the length of time it has been in the market, BTC is far more established than EOS. Since they’re both fundamentally different cryptocurrencies, it’s also not fair to say that they’re replacements for each other.

Tezos (XTZ) Staking Is Quite Popular, but Needs More Work

Crypto exchange Coinbase recently introduced Tezos (XTZ) staking rewards for its US-based customers. The exchange will now be offering this option to its UK clients and certain European Union member nations.

The company said it would be staking XTZ digital tokens on behalf of its clients, and would also be distributing staking rewards by sending them directly to customers’ Coinbase wallets. Tezos has also been used to launch tokenized assets, but it’s all still relatively new compared to Bitcoin.

Tezos also aims to provide a lot more functionality than Bitcoin but currently has a much smaller network in terms of transactions processed and the number of active users. Even if the Tezos network matures and onboards as many users as Bitcoin, it’s still doing something totally different than Bitcoin. This means that they’re both not alternatives for each. In other words, it’s like comparing apples to oranges.

Bitcoin Dominance Stands at Around 65%

While Alingan has mentioned some high-potential and active cryptocurrency projects, they are most likely not alternatives to Bitcoin (BTC).

Bitcoin has, by far, the largest market cap (currently over $167 billion) out of all other digital currencies. It also benefits from enormous network effects, because the vast majority of crypto transactions involve BTC.

Moreover, BTC dominance stands at nearly 65% (at time of writing), meaning that its bigger than the market cap of all digital assets combined.

Ethereum (ETH), which is the second-largest crypto-asset, only has a market cap of $25 billion, which is merely a small fraction of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Ethereum will also attempt to transition from proof of work to proof of stake based consensus, which is a very challenging technical upgrade. There’s no guarantee that the transition will be successful, which indicates that Ethereum may not be considered a reliable alternative to BTC in terms of investment diversification.

Ethereum also has an uncertain monetary policy, whereas Bitcoin’s supply has been algorithmically capped at 21 million. Because of these reasons, it’s difficult to accurately value Ethereum at this point.

Other distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions like Chainlink, Tezos, Stellar, and EOS are also in their early stages of development and adoption. They face significant challenges and have not yet firmly established themselves in the nascent digital asset market.",2020-06-16 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-dominates-crypto-brand-recognition-fca-survey/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

By far, Bitcoin has the strongest brand recognition among cryptocurrencies, according to a new report from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The report surveyed over 2,200 consumers and 658 cryptocurrency owners to find out about people’s crypto investment habits.

Bitcoin Leads the Pack

The FCA asked consumers about which cryptocurrencies that they had heard of. Bitcoin was by far the best-known cryptocurrency: 78% of respondents have heard of it.

Surprisingly, Facebook’s Libra was more popular than other altcoins. 22% of respondents have heard of it, even though it does not yet exist and faces regulatory barriers.

Respondents also reported awareness of altcoins like Bitcoin Cash (known by 20% of consumers), Ethereum (17%), Bitcoin SV (12%) and Litecoin (12%).

The FCA also examined exchanges. Among respondents, Coinbase was the most popular site, used by 63% of investors. Binance (15%), Kraken (10%), Bittrex (8%), and Bitfinex (7%) also had good usage among United Kingdom residents.

Other Findings

The FCA found that 5.3% of the United Kingdom’s population owns cryptocurrency, equal to about 2.6 million people. That number is up from last year, when 3% of the population (1.5 million people) reported owning crypto.

Crypto owners have the technical knowledge to understand the risks of investment, the FCA says, adding that most (47%) consider cryptocurrency a “gamble.”

Most investors (89%) recognized that they do not have regulatory protection for their purchases. 73% of respondents did not own crypto but plan to purchase in the future and cited a lack of regulatory protections for their decision. 29% of respondents do not intend to buy crypto at all, but said that protections would cause them to reconsider.

The report also found that advertising is important. 45% of all crypto owners reported seeing crypto ads, and about one-third of those 45% said that advertisements made them more likely to consider buying crypto.

Similar Studies

It should be noted that this data reflects UK users and may not generalize to other countries.

However, other groups and companies have run their own surveys. Paxful has published surveys on crypto adoption in India and in the U.S. in recent months. Meanwhile, Fidelity and Bitwise have published surveys on institutional investment in cryptocurrency.

Finally, these reports tend to focus on the perception of cryptocurrency. Surveys reveal very little about market conditions and on-chain activity—an angle that is left to cryptocurrency analysts.

The firm’s Retrievable Transfer feature works by building a new layer onto existing blockchain protocols. Users then have the ability to “cancel” a transaction sent to an incorrect cryptocurrency wallet address, the Israeli company said in a press release Tuesday.

“Our aim is to make blockchain transactions as simple and as secure as online banking,” said Kirobo CEO Asaf Naim.

The company’s logic layer functions by providing a unique transaction code that must be entered by the recipient in order to receive funds from the sender. Until the recipient has entered the correct code, the sender may retrieve the funds at any time.

Loss of funds can and does occur when a sender includes an error in the long string of alphanumeric characters that make up cryptocurrency addresses.

Kirobo cited a survey that found that 18% of respondents said they had lost funds through such sending errors. A way to make transactions less risky could help encourage new users of cryptocurrency..

“By removing the fear from crypto transactions, Kirobo will facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrency as a whole,” said Adam Levi, DAOstack CTO and adviser to Kirobo.

The startup said it does not hold or store a user’s private keys, with the unique code simply governing whether or not the transaction would be finalized. The feature can also operate offline should Kirobo’s servers go down.

Kirobo’s platform has received support from Israel’s Innovation Authority, the arm of the government charged with fostering industrial research and development.

A Brief on Cardano (ADA):-

Cardano is an open-source decentralized public blockchain network and cryptocurrency project and ADA is its native currency. It is also involved in the development of a smart contract platform that aims to be powered by enhanced features (project under development). Cardano enables intricate and programmable value transfers securely. The Cardano foundation was established by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum in 2015 and he was able to raise 60 million USD through Initial Coin Offering that took place in 2017.

It is considered as the first-ever blockchain platform to have evolved from a scientific philosophy with a research-first driven approach. Cardano is also one of the first to be built using the Haskell programming language. It uses a proof-of-stake algorithm called the Ouroboros which works differently than other proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms.",2020-06-30 10:42:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-etp-listed-europe-third-largest-exchange,"Deutsche Boerse has listed an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks the value of bitcoin.

21Shares, a Swiss-based product provider formerly known as Amun, said its bitcoin ETP had been officially accepted Wednesday to list on Xetra, Deutsche Boerse’s electronic trading venue.

“The listing on Xetra not only strengthens our current position in Germany but also opens up institutional-grade crypto products to the wider European and international markets,” said Laurent Kssis, 21Shares’ managing director, in a statement.

Deutsche Boerse Group has two trading venues: Xetra, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Together, they count as the third-largest trading platform in Europe, just behind the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.

Deutsche Boerse’s data shows more than €150 billion (US$168.6 billion) worth of equities and derivative products changed hands at Xetra in May. In December last year, the exchange handled approximately €300 billion in volume.

The London-based investment firm ETC Group listed a bitcoin-backed security on Xetra, earlier this month.

Bitcoin ETPs provide exposure to bitcoin in a regulated asset class. In contrast to the U.S., where regulators have been loathe to sign off on bitcoin ETF applications, there are already three to four entities offering crypto-backed products across Europe.

21Shares launched its first Bitcoin ETP at the end of 2018 on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest in Switzerland. The company has since launched products that track other cryptos, and some track multiple digital assets. It released a “Short Bitcoin” ETP that inversely tracks bitcoin’s price in February.

WisdomTree, the world’s largest product provider, launched a physically backed bitcoin ETP on SIX in December.

21Shares’ products already listed seven of its ETPs on retail-orientated Boerse Stuttgart, Germany’s second-largest exchange, in January.

Kssis told CoinDesk the firm wants to increase exposure in Europe’s institutional market.

“Most institutions do not have easy access to Stuttgart as it’s a regional exchange,” he said.

Swiss institutions currently hold up to 80% of 21Shares’ assets under management, according to Kssis.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced today that in order to resolve charges of violating federal securities laws, it has ordered Telegram to return more than $1.2 billion to its investors, and pay a hefty $18.5 million civil penalty to boot.

In August last year, Telegram promised that its newly-announced Gram currency — which would operate with a decentralized structure similar to Bitcoin — would be ready to by October 31st 2019. Because the initiative was largely born of a $1.7 billion investment round in 2018, Telegram said that if it hadn’t delivered Grams by the end of October it would return investors’ money. So it was already up against a tight deadline.

Come the middle of October, however, the SEC had intervened, obtaining a temporary restraining order against the company. The agency said Telegram didn't register the offering with its office, and since it sees Grams as securities, it accused the company of violating the Securities Act of 1933. Then, in March, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction barring the delivery of Grams. And now the SEC has issued its final judgement.

""New and innovative businesses are welcome to participate in our capital markets but they cannot do so in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws,"" said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC enforcement division's cyber unit. ""This settlement requires Telegram to return funds to investors, imposes a significant penalty, and requires Telegram to give notice of future digital offerings."" Telegram, meanwhile, accepted the penalty without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.

It’s not clear yet whether Telegram will revisit its Gram initiative in the future — if it does it will certainly do so under the watchful eye of the SEC — but the episode is illustrative of the wider problems companies face in getting cryptocurrency off the ground. Messaging service Kik was also ruled to have run its “Kin” token sale without proper regard for securities laws, while Facebook’s currency Libra has faced intense scrutiny from officials, leading to ongoing delays in launch.",,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-crypto-market-eerily-quiet-as-bitcoin-stuck-near-9k,"Quiet is the best word to describe the bitcoin market.

Some traders are growing tired of this range as expectations for a breakout in either direction are crushed. “Every breakout in the last six weeks has revealed to be a false one, taking many traders to the woodshed in just a few hours,” said David Lifchitz, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.

Even liquidated contracts on BitMEX, the largest bitcoin derivatives exchange by open interest, show how stagnant bitcoin’s price action has become. Total daily liquidations on the exchange have not passed even $4 million for three consecutive days, according to Skew.

Traders are getting “mixed messages” from the bitcoin markets, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at prime broker Bequant, told CoinDesk. “On the one hand, the futures curve is in contango (upward sloping), which is indicative of leverage interest. But, yet at the same time, the options market continues to point to downside price protection demand, with front-end (shorter-dated one-month [expirations]) skew much higher relative to the rest of the curve and also when compared to Ethereum,” said Vinokourov.

As its price stands still, bitcoin’s volatility plummets. Its 30-day volatility, for example, is reaching its lowest level since late February, according to Coin Metrics.

When bitcoin will finally pick a direction – up or down – for a new trend is anyone’s guess. “We’re still in a ‘wait-and-see’ phase,” Lifchitz told CoinDesk. The market, he added is “definitely in need of a catalyst to break above $10,000 on heavy volume or below $8,000.”

If the price drops, however, some traders expect bulls to capitalize on the opportunity and buy more. “Dip buyers,” a name for investors who increase their position sizes when an asset price declines, will “aggressively” buy any substantial drops in the bitcoin price, said Alistair Milne, chief investment officer at Altana Digital Currency Fund.

Taking to Twitter, Milne said traders are “still underestimating” the amount of bitcoin that has been accumulated and removed from the market by long-term, often ideological investors. The exact amount of bitcoins held off the market is roughly 73%, according to Glassnode. Also taking to Twitter, CTO Rafael Schultze-Kraft noted that approximately 13.5 million bitcoins have not moved since the start of 2020, signally bitcoin investors’ commitment to hold through an uncertain market.

Key Takeaways Ethereum's monetary policy dictates the issuance of just enough coins needed to adequately compensate miners.

With a human-determined monetary policy, Ethereum's issuance isn't immune to malicious actors.

Bitcoin offers a more stringent monetary policy which may not be great economically but enhances decentralization.

There is no single ""best policy"" as each person will put varying weights on each trade-off.

Share this article

An age-old debate between the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities revolves around which network has the better monetary policy. The answer to this lies on a spectrum and isn’t as binary as one would think.

Ethereum’s Minimum Necessary Issuance

There’s a stark difference between inflation and monetary inflation. The latter is an increase in a country or crypto network’s total money supply. Inflation, on the other hand, is an increase in the price of goods and services in an economy. Issuance on crypto networks is a matter of monetary inflation.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum issue native coins to miners as a reward for validating new transactions and blocks.

Unlike Bitcoin, which everyone knows tackles monetary inflation with block reward halvings, Ethereum takes a more digestible route. Rather than the network abruptly reducing block rewards, a policy of “minimum necessary issuance” is in place.

This policy dictates the Ethereum blockchain to issue only what is required to secure the network, allowing issuance to decrease with time.

It’s a more sustainable approach to monetary policy as miners are slowly weaned off high rewards instead of being suddenly sucker-punched.

While this allows for issuance to be better planned, the mechanism is at risk of being captured by malicious actors.

Ethereum’s monetary policy is subjective – not hardcoded.

As a result, bad actors can infiltrate the network and implement changes that are detrimental to long-term growth. While this has never been the case due to laudable community oversight and the ability to fork at a whim if such a plan is discovered, it is nevertheless a potential risk.

Bitcoin’s Strict Halvings

On the other side of the spectrum, we have Bitcoin.

As previously discussed, Bitcoin’s issuance is cut in half every four years in a process known as a halving. Thanks to the halving, the total amount of BTC that can ever exist is an easily predicted data point.

But this predictability comes at a cost. Bitcoin miners are forced to incur a revenue halving every four years. But, only miner revenue from block rewards is reduced. Income received via transaction fees stays the same; historically, fee collection has increased over time.

This phenomenon requires Bitcoin to develop into a high-fee market, making transactions on the blockchain more expensive over time. As per this theory, one day, fees will be the dominant form of miner compensation.

The problem with this theory is that as transactions get more expensive, users may migrate to other means of transacting. Bitcoin will still be a censorship-resistant network with unstoppable payments, but will that matter if fees are $20 a transaction?

On the positive side, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is levels more decentralized and immune to capture compared to Ethereum’s.

While a hard coded monetary framework is not ideal for a network, it eliminates human intervention giving users a sense of relief that they know exactly what’s going to happen.

What’s the Endgame?

The data makes certain conclusions fairly obvious. Ethereum has a more financially sustainable framework, but Bitcoin has a more decentralized and malice-proof issuance policy.

Further, Bitcoin halvings may reduce the absolute number of BTC received by miners, but this has not been a problem in the past. BTC price always makes up for this deficit and more. This gives miners an added incentive to boost prices and shape market cycles.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is set to undergo a period of transformation.

Proof of Stake is on the horizon as Ethereum 2.0’s imminent launch draws closer. This move will increase Ethereum’s monetary inflation for the short-term as the Proof of Work blockchain and Proof of Stake Beacon chain run together. As PoW is gradually wound down, ETH issuance dramatically reduces.

In fact, with the advent of EIP 1559, negative issuance for ETH is entirely possible if fee burns overpower ETH issuance. This would turn ETH into a deflationary asset – an outcome that excites some and irks others.

Overall, which policy is better differs from person to person.

Hardcore cypherpunks may be willing to sacrifice financial stability in exchange for a more decentralized policy, tilting them slowly towards Bitcoin.

More economic-minded individuals may not mind trading away some degree of decentralization in exchange for an issuance framework that ensures the long-term viability of the network.

Knowledge of the crypto industry has also improved as 73% of the population have now heard of crypto compared to just 42% in 2019.

“Technical knowledge appears high among most cryptocurrencies owners. Most consumers seem to understand the risks associated with the lack of protections, the high volatility of the product and have some understanding of the underlying technology.”

The survey also says traditional media influenced consumers’ attitudes towards digital assets as 16% of those who bought cryptocurrency at any point said their decision to get into crypto was influenced by an advertisement.

In addition, the study shows that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the UK with 78% of the respondents saying they know the leading digital asset.

The company is currently hiring crypto and blockchain specialists, meaning that its potential arrival could be more than a wild guess. But what does PayPal’s apparent interest in crypto mean for the industry, and how well does it align with the company’s principles?

Two steps forward, one step back

PayPal started to take baby steps toward crypto back in 2013. At the time, David Marcus, then-president of the payments company and now leading the Facebook-backed digital wallet Novi, told Bloomberg that “it’s just a question of whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal’s funding instrument or not.”

Several months later, John Donahoe, CEO at Ebay — PayPal’s parent company at the time — essentially confirmed that the payments platform will have to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) one day in order to keep up with the changing financial landscape. Following bullish remarks from its executives, PayPal partnered with three payment processors in the space in September 2014: BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. But PayPal merely tapped some third parties to handle Bitcoin transactions, and did not integrate Bitcoin into its digital wallet or offer to obtain crypto directly via its website.

Soon after the integration, PayPal started to split off from Ebay, and by July 2015, it became a separate public company. Donahoe took over as the payment platform’s chairman, while Dan Schulman became CEO at PayPal. Schulman’s views on crypto are mixed and arguably more bearish compared to that of Donahoe, who revealed that he owns Bitcoin, but finds cryptocurrencies too volatile to be a convenient medium of exchange in traditional commerce.

At the start of 2016, PayPal appointed Wences Casares — CEO and founder of Bitcoin wallet Xapo — to its Board of Directors, adding some crypto talent to its roster. In April 2019, the payments giant backed a blockchain startup for the first time, investing an undisclosed amount into Cambridge Blockchain — a fintech firm aiming to leverage the technology to empower users with more control over their digital identities.

However, in May that year, chief financial officer of PayPal John Rainey distanced the company from crypto, saying that it’s still “a little early on” to enter the sector. However, just one month later, PayPal was revealed as one of the founding members of the Libra Association — a not-for-profit, Switzerland-based consortium behind the Libra stablecoin — but left the organization soon after due to regulatory backlash.

As PayPal’s chief technical officer Sri Shivananda said, crypto developers must follow consumers in order to succeed. “If consumers start to feel like there’s some leverage that they get through cryptocurrencies, everything else will automatically fall in line,” he said.

“PayPal does not comment on rumors or speculation”

On June 22, it was reported that the payments giant is considering introducing direct sales of crypto assets via PayPal and Venmo, citing “three people familiar with the matter.” According to CoinDesk’s sources, PayPal may be working with multiple exchanges to provide liquidity. It is also allegedly planning to offer custodian services, offering users to store their crypto using PayPal’s digital wallet.

When asked to confirm or deny that information, a PayPal representative told Cointelegraph that “PayPal does not comment on rumors or speculation.” Nevertheless, PayPal’s job listings, posted around the same time, made the rumors somewhat more credible. PayPal advertised for a “crypto engineer” — a person responsible for “new initiatives for PayPal global with a focus on agility, time-to-market and innovation” as well as a blockchain research engineer to work within the company’s newly formed research group.

However, in its latest 10-K form filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2019, PayPal mentioned potential “rapid” developments in blockchain and virtual currencies as a possible risk factor that may negatively affect the company.

The customer is always right

Experts are generally not surprised by the reports suggesting the payment giant’s crypto expansion, as Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of the crypto lending platform Celsius Network told Cointelegraph: “I don’t see any contradiction to what they already do, their customers have crypto and they want to serve their customers better.” Aaron Henshaw, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm and Libra Association member Bison Trails, shared a similar sentiment in an email conversation with Cointelegraph:

“It wouldn’t be surprising that PayPal is looking at an overall adoption of digital assets. PayPal’s mission, to enable everyone to participate fully in the global economy, fits squarely with the promise of digital assets and blockchain technology providing greater access to financial systems around the world.”

In Henshaw’s view, embracing digital assets, which already account for billions of dollars, would just mean that PayPal is “looking toward the future.” John Todaro, the director of institutional research at TradeBlock told Cointelegraph that established mainstream companies are normally guided by potential client interest, not their past remarks:

“I do not think a move by traditional payments companies into the digital currency space necessarily contradicts their previous statements. Early on traditional financial institutions viewed the space with skepticism, as you saw with JP Morgan’s CEO in the past, and you are now seeing these same institutions warm up to crypto and that’s likely because they are seeing real, potential client interest/demand for crypto services.”

Sinjin David Jung, the managing director of blockchain firm IBMR.io, argued that PayPal’s expansion into crypto “was inevitable,” adding that it “will have been well thought out and strategically motivated,” and likely focused on the millennial clientele: “PayPal coming in means that they have assessed all the legal and regulatory risks along with the competitive benefits of providing crypto.” He went on to add: “This is not a B2B market play, rather, it is definitely directed to grabbing that millennial consumer base.”

Potential competitors

So, if the payments juggernaut goes ahead and decides to enter the crypto space after all, who would it have to compete against? According to Mashinsky, PayPal might be too large of a player to clash with any industry firms and might bring a whole new audience to the market: “They have over 270m customers and all of crypto is less than 50m users so the growth opportunity for everyone is that PayPal will double the crypto community and so all boats rise.”

Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse fintech firm, suggested that PayPal would have to compete with top-tier exchanges like Coinbase, but its largest rival might be Jack Dorsey’s Square app, as it was also created to provide alternative payment solutions. While according to Jung, the real competitors for PayPal are “really the other fintech wallet apps like Robinhood and Revolut,” and referred to PayPal as their “granddaddy” who has “definitely fallen behind on the innovation front,” adding:

“But with PayPal coming in, this is more a threat to every other fintech crypto app out there who are focused on payments and remittance as their competitive advantage. [...] I doubt PayPal will ever run an exchange and their margins will always be better served by acting as the buyer and seller of crypto from exchange sources. If anything PayPal becomes a strong onboarding tool for exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini.”

Mass adoption and market demand

The most obvious implication of PayPal’s rumored expansion is adoption — if a financial service with 325 million active users starts listing digital assets, it is likely to make crypto more viable in the eyes of the financial mainstream. Mashinsky argued that it will consequently drive the price of BTC and Ether (ETH) up significantly, “as the scarcity of the coins will play a big part when adoption comes.”

Jung told Cointelegraph that PayPal’s arrival might signal the start of crypto’s mainstream adoption and prompt the industry to become more consolidated, largely putting an end to altcoins as a class. He added, “This doesn’t necessarily mean that there will be fewer tokens, in fact, this will likely create a boom in the tokenization of assets and more robust crypto businesses.”

Finally, PayPal may benefit the crypto industry by serving as a bridge to connect crypto audience with traditional finance and onboard new users that have not experienced crypto before, TradeBlock’s Todaro suggested, adding: “In order to gain heightened adoption of digital currencies, there needs to be a bridge between traditional incumbents and these new decentralized crypto services, which we have been seeing.”

Meanwhile, it becomes apparent that PayPal is in demand among crypto users. Earlier this week, Singapore-based blockchain firm Pundi X integrated PayPal support for its point-of-sale device, Xpos. The move followed a Twitter poll asking which mobile payment app they would like Xpos to integrate with first. PayPal received nearly 70% of votes, outstripping WeChat Pay, Alipay and GoPay, among others.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-trading-firm-b2c2-prime-brokerage-sbi-holdings-30m-stake,"Disclosure

But this isn’t the case with Narkasa, an Istanbul-based cryptocurrency exchange that allows investors to buy crypto-assets with a number of different currencies. What’s more, the new service is offering a 50-percent fee discount on all transactions carried out within 90 days of its launch.

‘156 currencies from around the world’

With cutting-edge technology and services available in 12 languages, Narkasa provides investors with a platform for fast and secure cryptocurrency trading in a range of currencies. “Along with the dollar and euro, Narkasa supports transactions in Russian rubles, Ukrainian hryvnias, Brazilian reals, Kazakhstani tenges, and Turkish liras,” Narkasa CEO Erdal Kaya said.

“And we’re planning to expand our operations further to allow crypto-trading in 156 different national currencies,” he added. “Unlike most other exchanges, Narkasa will allow investors to purchase cryptocurrency from whatever country they happen live.”

Safe, reliable cryptocurrency trading

Narkasa doesn’t charge any commissions on the purchase of cryptocurrency through its platform and also guarantees that all its clients’ personal data is safe and secure. Regularly assessed by independent auditing companies, the firm operates in accordance with the EU’s anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing laws, while also adhering to “know your customer” guidelines.

Moreover, through the use of API technology, Narkasa provides a platform for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading. This allows clients to manage their investments using artificial intelligence specifically designed to protect against abrupt market fluctuations.

Cryptos taking world by storm

The number of cryptocurrencies now in use currently stands at 2,687, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Ripple accounting for 82 percent of total trade volume, which continues to surge at a dizzying pace. The proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges, meanwhile, has led to a dramatic rise in the number of those investing in the sought-after commodity.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/70113/crypto-asset-manager-nydig-raises-190-million-for-bitcoin-fund,"The New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has raised $190 million for one of its bitcoin funds, according to a Form D document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday.

The fund, called NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP, has grabbed the amount from 24 unnamed investors, per the form. The fund initially registered with the SEC in 2018. At the time, it raised $31 million from 3 investors. Later, in 2019, it raised $54 million from 6 investors. Wednesday’s amount is a fresh investment from two dozen investors.

The fund’s investment strategy remains unclear. The Block has reached out to NYDIG for more details and will update this story should we hear back.



NYDIG is a regulated entity that received a BitLicense in 2018 and a limited purpose trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services in 2019.

NYDIG operates two more bitcoin funds - the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund and the NYDIG Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund.

The NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund was approved by the SEC in December 2019 and is a portfolio fund in the Stone Ridge Trust VI. The fund invests in cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts offered by CME. In December, NYDIG aimed to raise $25 million through the fund. It is not clear whether the fund raised that amount or what is its current size.

The other fund, NYDIG Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund, was disclosed in May of this year and raised nearly $140 million. The growing assets under management (AUM) of NYDIG suggest that institutional investors are increasingly looking to get bitcoin exposure. In comparison, top crypto asset manager Grayscale has a total AUM of over $4 billion.



A recent survey by Fidelity Digital Assets found that nearly 80% of 800 institutional investors in the U.S. and Europe see the appeal of digital assets and more than a third of such investors have already invested in the market. More investors have also taken on exposure to derivatives, according to the survey. The percentage of U.S. investors with exposure to cryptocurrency futures increased from 9% in 2019 to 22% in 2020.",,https://www.coindesk.com/swiss-government-makes-moves-to-encourage-crypto-businesses,"The Swiss government is encouraging blockchain startups to set up shop with new laws that lower legal barriers to such businesses while leaving favorable tax laws untouched.

The National Council, Switzerland’s equivalent of the U.S. House of Representatives, unanimously passed a legislative package changing about a dozen financial laws on June 17. The changes, proposed by the Swiss Federal Council, are intended to remove legal barriers to applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

On June 19, the Federal Council acknowledged a report prepared by the Federal Department of Finance that concluded there was no need to make special amendments to existing tax laws with regard to blockchain. The report was commissioned by the Federal Council in 2018 when the government decided to examine existing tax laws and assess any need for amendments.

Switzerland has long been a blockchain startup magnet. The city of Zug, in particular, was a popular location for token-funded projects during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, earning it the nickname Crypto Valley.

While ICOs have faded, Switzerland’s enthusiasm for blockchain technology has not.

“It’s known that Switzerland is very much trying to encourage blockchain business. It’s a political objective,” said Rolf H. Weber, professor of financial market law and chair of the working group for regulatory issues at the Swiss Blockchain Federation.

The changes were largely based on a Federal Council proposal filed last year, and will now be passed on to the upper chamber, the Council of States, for a final vote this fall.

Through communications specialist Joel Weibel, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration said Swiss laws must guarantee legal certainty and the openness of authorities to new technologies.

The new laws

As it exists now, Swiss law is cumbersome, particularly when applied to the transfer of security tokens, Weber said. All transfers must be done in writing, like the traditional exchange of a bond. But the new legislation will make the transfer of security tokens easier, Weber said.

“In my opinion, the most important changes are in company and securities law,” Weber said.

Unlike any digital asset before it, a token has the same characteristics of a piece of paper, or written agreement, said Christian Meisser, CEO of Swiss blockchain legal consultancy fim LEXR AG.

“Why not give it the same properties as a piece of paper? If you transfer a token, you also transfer any right of ownership linked to it. That is the revolutionary aspect of the new Swiss law,” Meisser said.

According to Weber, as soon as the law is enacted, owners will be able to freely register and transfer their security tokens within distributed electronic ledgers, and providers of ledger technology will be allowed to offer those services without legal ramifications.

New provisions made to bankruptcy laws would allow owners to appeal to authorities to reclaim their assets.

“This is not possible today with digital tokens because with tokens you don’t have proof of ownership. It’s similar to cash. You can never extract or withdraw cash from a bankrupt estate,” Weber said.

The new laws also contain eight provisions describing how providers of digital ledger technology and trading platforms can obtain a license from the financial authority.

Even though the legislative package passed without opposition, according to Meisser, left-leaning politicians raised concerns the new laws failed to address the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, a process that requires large quantities of energy and resources.

The broader framework

Instead of proactively regulating new financial instruments, lawmakers in Switzerland typically try first to apply existing laws, said Luzius Meisser, founder of Bitcoin Association Switzerland

“Once that doesn’t work anymore, then we create a new law,” Luzius said.

In his view, Switzerland does not look at blockchain technology or crypto assets as unique entities, but as extensions of existing instruments.

According to Weber, the new laws would change the broader framework to improve conditions for owners and providers of crypto assets.

“You may say this is a ‘blockchain law’ because all changes relate to blockchain business models. But in contrast to a few other countries like Malta or the Principality of Liechtenstein, Switzerland is not going to implement blockchain law in a narrow sense,” Weber said.

Reducing taxes

Two days after the National Council vote on June 17, the Federal Council decided prevailing Swiss tax laws will not need to be amended to include special considerations for blockchain technology.

As things stand in Switzerland, bitcoin mining is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) while some security tokens are exempt from withholding tax, and there is no capital gains tax on investments.

According to Luzius, Switzerland has a withholding tax placed on dividends earned from traditional securities such as bonds or shares. Weibel from the tax authority said this tax also applies to “shares in tokenized form” to ensure all investors are treated equally.

“But current Swiss law also allows participation in the company’s profit without levying the withholding tax on the income related to this profit. This option is now also available in the attractive form of tradable participation tokens,” Weibel said.

In simpler terms, there are certain special taxes in Switzerland that do not apply to security tokens but apply for securities, Luzius said.

“Lawmakers say they are okay with not filling this gap for now because the market for security tokens is still very small,” Luzius said.

To encourage earnings through investment, the country does not tax capital gains on any investment, and the Department of Finance report assessing the need for new tax laws concluded there was no need to start with crypto.",2020-07-01 08:00:07+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-as-traditional-markets-rally-bitcoin-gets-boring,"Bitcoin broke above $9,250 for the first time since Friday as the leading cryptocurrency continues to trade in a tight range just above $9,000 for several weeks.

Despite trading above $9,250, bitcoin is still stuck within a tight range of a few hundred dollars above $9,000. As a result, 30-day volatility continues to decline. In fact, bitcoin’s volatility reached its lowest mark since Feb. 23, according to Coin Metrics.

As bitcoin stagnates, traditional markets soar. Tesla made an all-time high Wednesday, climbing $1,134, up more than 6% from its daily open. Zoom also bounced back toward its all-time high of $262 after dropping Friday through Monday, up 3.6% from its Wednesday open.

Why is bitcoin so quiet? There are simply “more eyeballs away from the crypto market and more towards traditional financial markets,” said Eliézer Ndinga, research associate at digital asset manager 21Shares. Many retail traders are using the popular retail equities trading platform Robinhood to speculate as traditional markets rally amid the on-going coronavirus pandemic.

“Despite various efforts to boost institutional adoption, retail traders account for 96% of all exchanges’ transfers,” Ndinga added. For many of these traders, the stock market may be more interesting than cryptocurrency markets.

Despite retail investors’ temporarily waning interest, institutional investors continue to develop the cryptocurrency market’s infrastructure. New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) raised $190 million from 24 investors for a new bitcoin fund, CoinDesk reported Wednesday. The New York-based asset manager, which has held a New York BitLicense since 2018, raised $140 million in May for a similar investment vehicle, the Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund.

Meanwhile, loyal cryptocurrency traders are increasingly keen to use decentralized exchanges. In June, aggregate volumes for these platforms grew 70% to a record high of over $1.5 billion.

This rapid growth carries some security concerns, however. Decentralized finance analyst Jack Purdy told CoinDesk the spike in trading volumes on these nascent platforms is “starting to become a bit worrisome” due to the fact that a variety of complex attack vectors still exist.

All rights reserved.",,https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/a-vulnerability-in-some-bitcoin-wallets-leads-to-double-spend-attacks-and-inflated-balance/,"ZenGo, a startup that is building a mobile cryptocurrency wallet, has discovered a vulnerability in some of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets, such as hardware wallet Ledger, BRD and Edge.

Named BigSpender, the vulnerability might lead to an incorrect balance on your wallet as unconfirmed transactions are taken into account in your total balance. The attacker could revoke the transaction before it is confirmed, which could lead to some confusion.

Even if you’re not familiar with cryptocurrencies, that type of attack is quite popular on peer-to-peer marketplaces, such as Craigslist.

Let’s say you’re trying to sell a phone. Somebody might tell you that they want to buy your device and send you a fake PayPal transaction email. If you just look at the email, you might think the buyer has already sent you the money. But if you load your PayPal account, you might notice that the buyer never sent you anything — it was a fake payment notification email.

BigSpender could be used in the same way, but with cryptocurrencies. The potential attacker leverages a feature in the bitcoin protocol called Replace-by-Fee. This feature lets you send some bitcoins with a low transaction fee and then send the same crypto assets but with a higher transaction fee.

The original transaction is canceled and replaced with the new one. This way, the new transaction should be confirmed more quickly as miners process transactions with higher transaction fees first.

But some cryptocurrency wallets take unconfirmed transactions for granted a bit too quickly. When you check your balance, it looks like you’ve received some bitcoins, but the sender may have canceled it to replace that transaction with another one to another wallet — a wallet that they control. Even though the transaction has been canceled, the balance still reflects those fake transactions.

If the attacker is trying to fake-buy something really expensive, they can use the BigSpender attack multiple times even if they don’t have a lot of money. For instance, they could initiate 10 transactions each worth 0.1 BTC, the recipient would see a balance of 1 BTC even though they received 0 BTC.

Because the wallet has miscalculated the balance, attackers could also leverage the BigSpender vulnerability to freeze your crypto assets using a denial-of-service attack. When the victim tries to send some bitcoins after receiving a ton of fake transactions, the wallet might try to send crypto assets that never arrived. The transaction fails.

To be clear, your existing bitcoins remain safe. Usually, clearing the app cache and resyncing your wallet with the bitcoin blockchain solves that issue. But you might not understand why you can’t use your crypto assets.

BigSpender isn’t a vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol — it doesn’t let you steal bitcoins. But it can be used to confuse users. Going forward, wallets should clearly mark unconfirmed transactions with a big “pending” label without increasing the balance of the wallet. Transactions that have been replaced using Replace-by-Fee should also be identified as failed.

ZenGo disclosed the vulnerability with Ledger, Edge and BRD 90 days ago. Ledger and BRD have handed bug bounty awards to ZenGo. BRD has released a fix already while Edge and Ledger are working on fixes. ZenGo also released an open-source tool to test your wallet against BigSpender to see the behavior.

Update: Ledger has published a blog post minimizing the impact of BigSpender. The company doesn’t consider it a vulnerability but more as a design flaw — your funds remain safe. “Everything has been fixed in the most recent update that was released two days ago,” VP of Marketing Benoît Pellevoizin told me. Unconfirmed transactions are highlighted, there’s a message next to your balance if there are unconfirmed transactions, and Ledger Live doesn’t use funds from unconfirmed transactions when you’re sending funds by default.",2020-07-01 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/ripple-is-becoming-dumping-ground-bitcoin-spam-transactions/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Despite its high transaction speed and low fees, Ripple is not favored as a Layer 2 for BTC.

A significant percentage of the daily payments on Ripple is spam, highlighting the extent of low activity on the network.

Lack of smart-contracts reduces Ripple’s transparency and bars it from participating in the DeFi and the stablecoin sectors.

As Ethereum attracts more and more precious Bitcoin into its network, Ripple is attempting something quite similar. The results, however, appear far from convincing.

Everyone Wants a Piece of Bitcoin

Bitcoin has the largest market cap, along with the dominance of over 60% on the crypto market. Moreover, it is reported to be the most recognized brand in the space. Any project interoperable with Bitcoin has a chance to draw a substantial portion of the market’s attention.

So far, Ethereum has enjoyed the most interoperability with Bitcoin.

With apps like Compound, Bitcoin hodlers can enter the growing field of decentralized finance (DeFi) and earn passive income on their idle coins. This opportunity drove significant traffic to the platform, specifically to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

WBTC is a pegged token, meaning that for each token held by a custodian, there is one ERC-20 token minted on Ethereum. Now it looks like the XRP Ledger is attempting a similar initiative.

While Ripple can’t extend Bitcoin’s computational capabilities, it can increase Bitcoin’s speed and reduce transaction fees.

Cheapness and speed of transacting can make pegged Bitcoin on the XRP Ledger useful for arbitrage, with traders driving on-chain activity. An influx of minted BTC on Ripple, with some accounts holding hundreds of thousands of tokens, points to a potential surge in demand.

Unlike Ethereum, however, the XRP Ledger won’t be able to ride the decentralized finance wave because of its limitations.

Trusted Setups in a Trustless World

Like WBTC, Ripple utilizes trusted token arrangements to mint pegged tokens. These custodians on the Ripple network are called “gateways.”

There are a handful of these reputable gateways. Given their BTC capitalization dynamics, it’s obvious that they didn’t issue any significant quantities of BTC lately. Moreover, BTC trading volumes remain dismal.

Unlike WBTC, which only has one custodian, BitGo, Ripple can have an unlimited number of gateways.

Technically, any account can act as a gateway and issue non-XRP tokens like BTC, ETH, and USD. Ultimately, it is up to users to decide which gateways they trust.

There is no ceiling on how many tokens an account can issue; the only limitation is the number of tokens other users want to hold. Moreover, an issuer can block issued tokens from being transacted by the broader Ripple community.

As a consequence, one can issue tokens without actually holding BTC and transfer them between accounts.

A reputable gateway has numerous connections to other accounts because they are actively used. A fraudulent one is likely to have much fewer connections. In the example below, the amount of BTC on an account connected with just three others topped 30,000 BTC.

Another suspicious factor is frequent transactions of similar amounts coming in and out between the same accounts.

Ripple is flooded with these kinds of spam transactions.

According to the on-chain data analyzed by Crypto Briefing, there are more than ten addresses constantly generating large pegged BTC payments between each other.

A cumulative number of daily payments for just three of them exceeds 9,000, more than 1% of the network’s current daily transactions.

Importantly, these addresses use trust lines that are not controlled by any means. Hence, the pegged BTC issued for them is not necessarily backed by real bitcoins. As a consequence, this activity does not represent genuine interest in Ripple from the Bitcoin community.

The Real State of Affairs

While Ripple’s pegged BTC numbers are inflated by spam, the real on-chain activity is also disappointing. For instance, daily transactions declined more than three times from the levels seen at the beginning of 2020.

A similar, but worse situation is observed with payments that declined from millions in 2019-2020 to tens of thousands.

Meanwhile, Ethereum’s daily transaction volume is on the rise due to the growing popularity of DeFi. Besides, more USDT are minted in response to the market’s demand.

Unlike Ethereum and Tether, Ripple struggles to find its use in the current market circumstances.

Why Not Ripple?

Since the first altcoin appeared, the game was always to offer a better alternative to Bitcoin. And, providing a better option was easier before the market became saturated with thousands of altcoins.

Now, the fixation on the transactions per second race is coming to an end with the release of Ethereum 2.0. It’s no longer compelling enough to be a faster version of Bitcoin.

Ripple has the potential to improve its market position with a smart-contract layer called Flare.

Flare is focused on bringing XRP Ledger to the dApp space; it’s currently in the testnet stage. Though, for now, its weakness is showing.

Speculation alone cannot buoy XRP’s price. Combined with sell-side pressure from the Ripple corporation and other insiders, the price will continue to decline until it can regain legitimate footing in the market.

Right now, traders are loading up on more conservative portfolios comprised of Bitcoin and stablecoins to hedge against the crypto market’s recent correlation with the stock market. Hot trends like DeFi are the exception to the norm, providing outsized returns.

Unfortunately for XRP, it’s tech can’t offer much to capitalize on either of these trends.

The company’s chief disclosed the increase in response to questions from First Mover about this year’s market-dominating gains in Crypto.com’s CRO tokens. According to the company’s website, the tokens can be used for “cross-asset intermediary currency settlement for the native Crypto.com Chain.”

The CRO token has nearly quadrupled in price this year, the top performer among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. As reported by First Mover on Wednesday, the token was also the best performer in June.

Cryptocurrency analysts including TradeBlock’s John Todaro say the Hong Kong-based company has raised its profile through extensive marketing efforts, such as promotions and sponsorships, while pushing into new businesses that have attracted users and interest in the CRO tokens. (Last month, Crypto.com sponsored a portion of CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed virtual conference.)

Speculation is a hallmark of cryptocurrency markets and traders appear to be betting big on CRO in 2020, given its 273% gain since the start of the year. That’s well ahead of the second-best performer, Cardano’s ADA token, which is up 177%. Bitcoin, whose $170 billion market capitalization is about 75 times that of the CRO tokens, is up just 29%.

First Mover reached out to Marszalek to get his comments on the outsize gains. A spokesman sent Marszalek’s responses via email.

What would be your comment/explanation on why CRO has done so well this year in digital-asset markets?

As a rule of thumb, we don’t comment on price action. The overall market has done really well this year and there are plenty of digital assets that performed well. Our focus is solely on building great products for our rapidly growing customer base.

What would Crypto.com consider to be the primary achievements/milestones of June/the second quarter/this year/the past six months?

We’re the only crypto debit card program that is live in the U.S., Europe and Asia. This global rollout of a much-loved product led to rapid growth in our user base from 1 million in September 2019 to 2 million in early May 2020. We’ve just hit the 3 million user milestone only two months after hitting 2 million.

According to one analyst, a part of Crypto.com’s performance could be attributed to marketing spending. How much has Crypto.com spent on advertising this year? Would you agree with this analyst’s assessment?

Our primary source of new customers is word of mouth. We’ve spent four years building a rock-star product that people love and recommend to their friends. We now have a nearly complete crypto ecosystem, covering payments (Visa cards, Crypto.com Pay), trading (exchange, wallet app) and finance (lending and interest accounts), so there are plenty of reasons for people to use our products. Attributing our growth to marketing alone is not seeing the forest for the trees: You need a great product before you spend a single dollar on marketing.

Do you think there’s any speculation driving the token related to future developments and/or partnerships/initiatives? If so, what would those be?

Our ecosystem roadmap has been published in November 2019 and we’re simply relentlessly executing against it. Looking at our monthly updates or even the Twitter feed, there is rarely a day without a product improvement being rolled out. Rapid progress is clearly visible to anyone comparing our roadmap with what we deliver every week.

Crypto.com earlier this week was running a 50% off sale on $2 million worth of BTC. Would it be fair to say that this promotion would cost roughly $1 million worth of bitcoin?

It’s a special event to celebrate our fourth anniversary and gives us an opportunity to reflect on all the milestones we hit during this time. At the same time, it helps us to onboard more customers to our exchange, which has launched in beta in November 2019. We’re committed to investing in the exchange business until it reaches critical mass.

BTC: Price: $9,215 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,300 | 24-Hr Low: $9,141

Trend: Bitcoin’s on-chain network activity is surging as price volatility stays close to an all-year low. But this isn’t as paradoxical as may appear.

Bitcoin jumped to $9,300 Wednesday, sparking hopes of that an expected range breakout had started, before returning to just over $9,200 at press time.

Crypto markets analyst Mati Greenspan wrote in a daily report: “Bitcoin is pretty much flat at the moment, and it's still unclear if it's headed toward support around the 200-day moving average or if it's gonna look for a fresh breakout above $10,000.”

Glassnode data shows active wallet addresses and new addresses are at 1-year and 2-year highs, respectively, while hourly spent outputs – bitcoin’s volumes – are at an all-time high.

This suggests bitcoin may be unusually liquid – low volatility has tightened spreads, meaning volumes are effectively funneled through a smaller selection of quotes.

Then again, it could just be market makers injecting liquidity into exchanges.",2020-07-02 12:47:34+00:00,https://cryptoslate.com/dont-even-think-crypto-will-be-immune-to-a-derivative-crisis-bitcoin-whale/,"Prior to the pandemic, it was a common narrative in crypto space that Bitcoin was immune to any macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. In fact, many argued that chaos, at least in some forms, is what drives BTC higher.

Yet, if the cryptocurrency market’s brutal crash in March says anything, it’s that this sentiment may not hold its water.

Pseudonymous Bitcoin whale “Joe007,” who has publicly made dozens of millions of dollars according to Bitfinex, doubled down on this in a recent statement.

Crypto won’t be unscathed in a liquidity crisis: Bitcoin whale Joe007

You may not know it but the stocks you trade and the Bitcoin you buy are only a fraction of the global financial markets.

In aggregate, the market capitalization of the S&P 500 is only around $30 trillion. Even more striking, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies comes in at under one percent of that, $264 billion.

So what drives financial markets? Derivatives, a lot of derivatives.

Derivatives are financial contracts that “derive [their] value from the performance of an underlying entity.” This means that while there may only be $1 trillion worth of, say, Apple stock, there can be billions or trillions more of derivatives betting on the direction of the stock.

It’s hard to say exactly how big this market is, yet some argue it is literally in the quadrillions. Even low-end estimates put the size of this market at an order of magnitude larger than the spot S&P 500.

Some fear that a collapse in the derivatives complex may take place.

Precious metal giant Goldmoney released a report in April that indicated there are scary signals in the gold derivatives market that is representative of a “wider derivative catastrophe.”

Context aside, the takeaway is that there isn’t enough physical gold to back derivatives contracts. With gold being one of the world’s most important assets, with it still acting as a macro asset despite the abolishment of the gold standard, Goldmoney wrote that “bankers are staring into an abyss.”

According to Joe007, the aforementioned Bitcoin whale, the small crypto “puddle” is almost certainly going to be affected by the crisis:

“If derivative crisis starts to fully play out, don’t even think crypto will be somehow immune from it.”

He added that to mitigate the risks of the liquidity crunch that will happen in a derivative crisis, he is inclined to hold physical gold bars and Tether’s USDT.

The worst modern economic shock

Along with expecting a derivative crisis, the Bitcoin trader is also a proponent of the sentiment that the global economy is in the midst of the biggest “economic shock of our generation.”

“It will unfold in waves and over time, giving false hopes and then crushing them. The focus of the crisis will be shifting through different areas. Attempts to alleviate and solve one crisis will lead to more mess,” he wrote around the start of the ongoing recession and pandemic.

Joe007 shared a UC Davis paper around the same time indicating that due to the pandemic, the “economic reality we all lived in prior to 2020 likely ended.” Get ready for a “tough 20 years going forward,” he added, referencing the model’s conclusion that pandemics are followed with “depressed investment opportunities.”

Lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who served prison time before, and NAC Foundation CEO Marcus Andrade have been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department with conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offering of digital asset security AML BitCoin, which they claimed was superior to the original Bitcoin because of its security features.

The SEC alleges that Nevada-based NAC Foundation raised at least $5.6 million from more than 2,400 retail investors by selling tokens that could later be converted to AML BitCoin. According to the SEC’s complaints, NAC and its CEO claimed AML BitCoin was better than Bitcoin because it purportedly had anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, and theft-resistant technology built into the coin. According to the SEC, none of the claimed security capabilities existed and the development of AML BitCoin and its blockchain was in the very early stages.

“We allege that these defendants repeatedly misled investors into funding non-existent technology, falsely claiming that the technology would make digital asset transactions more secure,” Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, said in a statement. “Investors are entitled to truthful information so they can make fully informed investment decisions.”

This isn’t Abramoff’s first time on the wrong end of the law. He served almost four years after pleading guilty in 2006 to conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion connected to a lobbying scandal. In exchange for aiding his clients, he sought to influence officials with Super Bowl tickets, overseas trips, gifts, and campaign contributions.

In the cryptocurrency incident, the SEC charges that NAC and Andrade falsely claimed that multiple government agencies were negotiating to use AML BitCoin, while Abramoff and Andrade falsely claimed that they were on the verge of advertising AML BitCoin during the Super Bowl in an effort to drum up interest in the offering. The TV commercial they said would be aired during the game portrayed AML Bitcoin as impervious to hacking efforts by the North Korean government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.

According to the SEC’s complaint, Abramoff and Andrade hired a production company, filmed the advertisement, issued false press releases, and arranged and paid to have authors report that the advertisement was rejected by the NFL and NBC for being “too political.” However, in reality, NAC didn’t have the money to pay for the ad, the SEC said.

“In fact, NAC never intended, and had nowhere near enough capital, to run an advertisement during the Super Bowl,” said the SEC’s complaint. “Communications between Andrade and Abramoff confirm that they knew it was false to claim the Super Bowl advertisement had been rejected, and that they intended to create press attention around a fake rejection and conspired to conceal this plan from others.”

Abramoff also allegedly arranged and helped write articles, which were purported to be written by independent authors, rather than disclosing that they were paid promotions of NAC. Some of the articles included false and misleading statements about NAC’s business, the SEC said.

The SEC has charged Abramoff, Andrade, and NAC with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and also charged Abramoff with broker/dealer registration violations. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties, in addition to injunctions prohibiting NAC and Andrade from participating in future securities offerings, and barring Andrade from serving as a public company officer or director.

Abramoff has agreed to a settlement imposing permanent and conduct-based injunctions, officer-and-director, industry, and penny stock bars, disgorgement of the $50,000 in commissions he received, plus prejudgment interest of $5,501.

Meanwhile, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California has launched parallel criminal actions against Andrade and Abramoff, charging Abramoff with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and lobbying disclosure violations, while charging Andrade with wire fraud.

If convicted, Abramoff faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and a fine of $500,000 for the charges against him, while Andrade faces a maximum sentence of 40 years, and a fine of $750,000, plus restitution if appropriate, for his alleged violations.

Binance celebrates third birthday with a branded Twitter emoji

After payments platform Crypto.com became the second cryptocurrency to get its own emoji on Twitter, the community was abuzz with speculation as to who will be the next to get a branded hashtag on one of the world’s most popular social media platforms.

After rumors of Ethereum and Tron being the ones to get their own emojis were disputed, the month of July began with massive news coming from Binance—the cryptocurrency exchange scored a deal with Twitter just ahead of its third birthday on Jul. 14.

Twitter hashtags #BNB, #Binance, #BUSD, #MyBinance, and #BinanceTurns3 will automatically be followed by an emoji of Binance’s yellow logo.

While Binance celebrated the emoji on its various Twitter accounts, the crypto community didn’t seem too excited about it. Many have pointed out that it was obvious that Binance paid a large sum of money for the emoji in terms of ad-spend, which rendered the achievement worthless in terms of increasing Binance’s popularity.

It’s been a known fact in the industry that any entity or company willing to allocate more than $50,000 to Twitter ads is eligible for its own branded emoji. Some companies have reportedly paid up to $1 million in order to get their branded emojis for the 2019 Super Bowl—Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Dove, Budweiser, and Pepsi have all paid to have emojis appear after certain hashtags.

Rather than just being a trendsetter, Bitcoin has created a benchmark and standard for cryptocurrencies. Since its inception, several cryptocurrencies have come into limelight. Today, we are going to learn about cryptocurrencies that evolved under the inspiration of crypto giants like Bitcoin.

We all know that cryptocurrency is virtual or digital money that comes in the form of tokens or coins. Each cryptocurrency is used for different purposes depending on the necessity. Cryptocurrencies ensure the processing of digital currencies and transactions over decentralized systems. As having a basic knowledge of cryptocurrency is sufficient to understand the entire blog, let us move on to know the types of cryptocurrencies. They are also known as Bitcoin alternatives.

#1: Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum is considered as the first Bitcoin alternative and is a scattered platform. It encourages Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications to be developed and executed. It protects the system from any downtime, interference from a third-party, fraud, or control. Ethereum has turned out to be the best choice for investors to even buy other digital currencies using Ether. After Bitcoin, Ethereum holds second place in the world in the market of cryptocurrency.

#2: Ripple (XRP)

Ripple stands unique when compared to Bitcoin and the other altcoins. It is a live global settlement network that enables immediate, low-cost, and specific international payments without any hassle. It provides a transparent exchange of money across countries at a conveniently low cost. Ripple cuts down the usage of computing power and decreases the network latency as it does not require mining at any stage. It comes pre-mined and involves only the introduction and removal of XRP from the market supply.

#3: Litecoin (LTC)

Litecoin was introduced in the year 2011, and it was among the first cryptocurrencies that resembled every characteristic of Bitcoin. It was often called the silver to the gold of Bitcoin. Without requiring any control by the central authority, it functions using the script as a proof of work. It is completely an open-source global payment network, which can be further decoded. Considering and comparing its market cap value, it takes sixth place in the world of the cryptocurrency market.

#4: Tether (USDT)

Tether was one among the first in the group of stablecoins, which aimed to attach their market value to a currency or any other external reference point to decrease volatility. This is one of the greatest cryptocurrencies, which is a strong block-chain enabled platform that allows fiat currencies into usage, digitally. Using Fiat currencies helps in reducing complexity linked with digital currencies.

#5: Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

Bitcoin Cash is considered the most important one in altcoins creation because it was one of the primal and successful blockchain technologies than the original bitcoin. In other words, we call this blockchain as hard forks. In earlier days, a fork occurs whenever there are debates and arguments between miners and developers. When these arguments do not come to an end, the digital currency is split. BCH is one of those splits introduced in the year 2017.

#6: Libra

Libra is a cryptocurrency of Facebook that has launched and given to 28 great companies to be under their own control. Facebook will have its own digital currency, which will be attached to their account as a wallet. This cryptocurrency is unique from other altcoins because of its motive behind the introduction. Rather than calling it as a cryptocurrency, we can call it as a money exchange medium for shopping and other money spends by users.

#7: Monero (XMR)

Monero caters to exceptional security mechanisms and offers great privacy. It is an open-source cryptocurrency but at the same time, inerasable as well. It enables ring signatures for complete privacy where even a group of signatures appear with one real participant, the signature of that person is not isolated. So, there are high chances of people using it for illegal activities. Still, it has great technology induced.

#8: EOS

Like Libra, EOS is also a cryptocurrency associated with a social media platform, introduced in the year 2018. Libra was not on a decentralized platform, but as EOS is designed after Ether, if offers a platform for developers to create decentralized applications.

#9: Bitcoin SV (BSV)

Bitcoin SV is a hard fork version of Bitcoin Cash; SV stands for Satoshi Vision. This again follows the history that BCH formed upon the debates and arguments among the BCH community; similarly, BSV also comes from the same manner.

#10: Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance Coin is the token offered by the Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange platform. It allows users to trade with different types of cryptocurrencies successfully on its own platform. It eases the transaction fees on exchange along with allowing you to pay for specific items and services.

Keep updating yourself with the latest news on cryptocurrencies and usage.",2020-07-03 10:54:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-bitcoin-ethereum-defi-double-act,"Tensions between the Bitcoin and Ethereum tribes have been stirred by a trend outsiders might see as a sign of harmony.

Throughout June, the amount of tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum, the bulk of it in WBTC, a special ERC-20 token known as “wrapped bitcoin,” soared from 5,200 BTC to 11,682 BTC – now worth around $108 million – according to btconethereum.com.

As is their wont, each faction described the growth of WBTC tokens, whose value is pegged one-to-one against a locked-up reserve of actual bitcoin, as proof of their coin’s superiority over the other. The Ethereum crowd said it showed that even BTC “hodlers” believe Ethereum-based applications provide a better off-chain transaction experience than platforms built on Bitcoin, such as Lightning or Blockstream’s Liquid. Bitcoiners, by contrast, took it as confirmation that people place greater value in the oldest, most valuable crypto asset, than in Ethereum’s ether token.

Beneath the rivalry on Crypto Twitter, the bitcoin-on-Ethereum trend says more about complementarity than competition.

The data simultaneously highlight that bitcoin is the crypto universe’s reserve asset and that Ethereum’s burgeoning “DeFi” ecosystem is crypto’s go-to platform for generating credit and facilitating fluid exchange.

Real-world parallels

Though it’s too early to know who the eventual winners will be, I believe this trend captures the early beginnings of a new, decentralized global financial system. So to describe it, an analogy for the existing one is useful: bitcoin is the dollar, and Ethereum is SWIFT, the international network that coordinates cross-border payments among banks. (Since Ethereum is trying to do much more than payments, we could also cite a number of other organizations in this analogy, such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) or the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).)

So, let’s dismiss claims like those of Ethhub.io co-founder Anthony Sassano. He argued that because bitcoin token transactions on Ethereum deny miners fees they would otherwise receive on the bitcoin chain, bitcoin is becoming a “second-class citizen” to ether. You’d hardly expect people in countries where dollars are preferred to the local currency to think of the former as second class. And just as the U.S. benefits from overseas demand for dollars – via seignorage or interest-free loans – bitcoin holders benefit from its sought-after liquidity and collateral value in the Ethereum ecosystem, where it lets them extract premium interest.

Still, to declare bitcoin the winner based on its appeal as a reserve asset is to compare apples to oranges. Ether is increasingly viewed not as a payment or store-of-value currency but for what it was intended: as a commodity that fuels the decentralized computing network orchestrating its smart contracts.

That network now sustains its financial system, a decentralized microcosm of the massive traditional one. It takes tokenized versions of the underlying currencies that users most value (whether bitcoin or fiat) and provides disintermediated mechanisms for lending or borrowing them or for creating decentralized derivative or insurance contracts. What’s emerging, albeit in a form too volatile for traditional institutions, is a multifaceted, market for managing and trading in risk.

This system is being fueled by a global innovation and development pool bigger than Bitcoin’s. As of June last year, there were 1,243 full-time developers working on Ethereum compared with 319 working on Bitcoin Core, according to a report by Electric Capital. While that work is spread across multiple projects, the size of its community gives Ethereum the advantage of network effects.

Whether DeFi can shed its Wild West feel and mature sufficiently for mainstream adoption, the code and ideas generated by these engineers are laying the foundation for whatever regulated or unregulated blockchain-based finance models emerge in the future.

Complexity vs. simplicity

There are legitimate concerns about security on Ethereum. With such a complex system, and so many different programs running on it, the attack surface is large. And given the challenges the community faces in migrating to Ethereum 2.0, including a new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and a sharding solution for scaling transactions, it’s still not assured it will ever be ready for prime time.

Indeed, the relative lack of complexity is one reason why many feel more comfortable with Bitcoin Core’s security. Bitcoin is a one-trick pony, but it does that trick – keeping track of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs – very well and very securely. Its proven security is a key reason why bitcoin is crypto’s reserve asset.

Base-layer security is also why some developers are building “Layer 2” smart contract protocols on Bitcoin. It’s harder to build on than Ethereum, but solutions are evolving – one from Rootstock, for example, and more recently, from RGB.

And while Ethereum fans crow about there being 12 times more wrapped bitcoin on their platform than the mere $9 million locked in the Lightning Network’s payment channels, the latter is making inroads in developing nations as a payment network for small, low-cost bitcoin transactions. Unlike WBTC, which requires a professional custodian to hold the original locked bitcoin, Lightning users need not rely on a third party to open up a channel. It’s arguably more decentralized.

Toward anti-fragility

At the same time, the inclusion of bitcoin in Ethereum smart contracts is inherently strengthening the DeFi system.

Meanwhile, the recent move by leading DeFi platform MakerDAO to include WBTC in its accepted collateral has meant it has a bigger pool of value to generate loans against.

This expansion in DeFi’s user base and market offerings is in itself a boost to security. That’s not just because more developers means more code vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed. It’s because the combinations of investors’ short and long positions, and of insurance and derivative products, will ultimately get closer to Nassim Taleb’s ideal of an “antifragile” system.

That’s not to say there aren’t risks in DeFi. Many are worried that the frenzy around speculative activities such as “yield farming” and interconnected leverage could set off a systemic crisis. If that happens, maybe Bitcoin can offer an alternative, more stable architecture for it. Either way, ideas to improve DeFi are coming all the time – whether for better system-wide data or for a more trustworthy legal framework. Out of this hurly burly, something transformative will emerge. Whether it’s dominated by Ethereum or spread across different blockchains, the end result will show more cross-protocol synergy than the chains’ warring communities would suggest.

Gold ‘to the Moon’

Bitcoin might be a reserve asset for the crypto community but its recent price trajectory, with gains and losses tracking equities, suggest the non-crypto “normies” don’t (yet) see it that way. Given the COVID-19 crisis’ extreme test of the global financial system and central banks’ massive “quantitative easing” response to it, that price performance poses a challenge to those of us who see bitcoin’s core use case as an internet era hedge against centralized monetary instability. Far from complying with that “digital gold” narrative, bitcoin has performed like any other “risk-off” asset. Meanwhile, actual gold has shaken off its own early-crisis stock market correlation to chart an upward course. While bitcoin has repeatedly failed to sustainably break through $10,000, bullion has rallied sharply to close in on $1,800, levels it hasn’t seen since September 2012. Some analysts are predicting it will breach its all-time intraday high of $1,917, hit in the aftermath of the last global financial crisis in 2011. To add insult to injury, one Forbes contributor even stole from the crypto lexicon to describe the state of play, telling his readers that gold prices are “soaring to the moon.”

Two charts below show the divergent fortunes of these two would-be safe havens. Throughout 2019, bitcoin seems far less correlated with the S&P 500 stock index than gold is. Come the collapse in March 2020, they seem to swap circumstances.

How to reconcile this? Time.

Gold has had at least three millennia to establish itself as a store of value people turn to when social systems are in stress. Bitcoin has only existed for 11 years. While plenty of investors are willing to speculate on the possibility bitcoin might supplant or compete with gold, the idea is far from ingrained across society. When will it be more widely accepted? Perhaps when the international crisis of global leadership unleashed by COVID-19 undermines the capacity of institutions like the Federal Reserve to sustain economic and social confidence. Whatever new institutions and systems we create going forward will need to address how the internet has upended society’s centralized systems of governance. When that happens, we’ll need a decentralized, digital reserve asset as the base value layer. As I said, it will take time. Meanwhile, the developers will keep building.

Global Town Hall

TRUST ME, BOND MARKET, PLEASE. James Glynn at The Wall Street Journal had a piece this week about how the Federal Reserve is considering following Australia’s lead in using “yield caps” as a policy tool to keep long-dated interest rates down. The thinking is if the central bank explicitly signals it will always institute bond-buying if the yield on a benchmark asset such as the 10-year Treasury note rises above some predefined ceiling, the market will be less inclined to prematurely believe the Fed is going to start tightening monetary policy. In other words, we won’t see a rerun of the 2013 “Taper Tantrum,” when the U.S. bond market, worrying that the Fed would start tapering off its bond-buying, or quantitative easing, drove down bond prices, which pushed up yields. (For bond market newbies, yields, which measure the effective annual return bondholders will earn off a bond’s fixed interest rate when adjusted for its price, move inversely to price.)

The yield cap policy would be new for the Fed, but it’s really an extension of an ongoing effort to do one thing: get the market to believe its intentions. The way monetary policy works these days, it’s meaningless unless the market behaves according to what the Fed wants. It’s not about what the central bank does per se; it’s about what it says and whether those words are incorporated into investor behavior. But the more it doubles down on this, the more the Fed creates situations in which it risks having its words held against it. And that puts it at risk of losing its most important currency: the public’s trust. Commitments to price targets are always especially risky – ask Norman Lamont, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had to abandon the pound’s currency peg in 1993 because the market didn’t believe the U.K. would back its promises. The Fed has unlimited power to buy bonds, but whether it always has the will to do so will depend on politics and other factors. Once it’s locked into a commitment, the stakes go up. For now, the markets – most importantly, foreign exchange markets – still trust the Fed. But, as the saying goes, trust is hard to earn, easy to lose.

ZIMBABWE ACCIDENTALLY LEAVES DOOR OPEN FOR CRYPTO. Here’s a recipe for creating a fertile environment for alternative payment systems: outlaw the system everyone is currently using. When the Zimbabwean government made the nutty step of banning digital payments – used for 85% of transactions by individuals, due to severe shortage of cash – it clearly wasn’t trying to promote bitcoin. In forcing people to go to a local bank to redeem funds locked in popular payments apps such as Ecocash, its goal was to protect the embattled Zimbabwean dollar. In a statement, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said the move was “necessitated by the need to protect consumers on mobile money platforms which have been abused by unscrupulous and unpatriotic individuals and entities to create instability and inefficiencies in the economy.” The thinking is that Ecocash, which enables currency trading, is making it easier for people to dump the local currency. But here’s the thing: Ecocash, which said it suspended cash-in-cash-out functions (presumably because its banking lines will be cut) is still keeping in-app payment facilities open. And it said nothing about stopping its fairly popular service allowing people to buy cryptocurrency. Not surprisingly, since the ban “demand for bitcoin has skyrocketed,” according to African crypto news site, bitcoinke, with “sources claiming bitcoin is now selling at at 18% premium above the market rate.”

OF MONEY AND MYTHS. I’m reading Stephanie Kelton’s book “The Deficit Myth.” In a future edition of Money Reimagined, I’ll have more to say on the most influential modern monetary theory proponent’s explanation of its ideas. But for now I’ll just say that, while I’m not likely to be a convert to all its prescriptions, it seems clear that MMT is widely misunderstood by folks on both the left and the right – also, very much by the crypto industry. The latter is perhaps because people in crypto tend to skew more to the metallist school of money, rather than to chartalism. Either way, a clearer grasp of what MMT is all about would, I believe, help improve the industry’s discussion around government, money, trust and how blockchain-based systems can integrate with the existing one.

DeFi’s ‘Agricultural Revolution’ Has Ethereum Users Turning to Decentralized Exchanges. DEX, often touted as a fairer and safer way to trade cryptocurrencies, might finally have its use case: yield farming. In the past, as Brady Dale reports, most people haven’t wanted to self-custody, preferring institutions to manage the risks of holding their keys for them. But in DeFi, where people undertake dual borrowing-and-lending schemes to make big, quick returns on incentives and high interest rates, is better if you control the keys during the trade. And decentralized exchanges are seizing the opportunity.

However, while gold has a strong track record of rallying in times of stress in the global equity markets, bitcoin has yet to build a similar reputation as a safe-haven asset.

In fact, in recent months, the cryptocurrency has been increasingly correlated with the S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index and benchmark for global stock markets. Now, data suggests that relationship is stronger than ever, likely denting bitcoin’s appeal as digital gold.

The one-month bitcoin-S&P 500 realized correlation rose to a record high of 66.2% on June 30 and stood at 65.8% on Thursday, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew, which began tracking the data in April 2018.

“While bitcoin and S&P 500 correlation is always a very good indicator of market movement, it never really maintains a consistent position. Bitcoin behaves more like a highly leveraged position and follows the market trends in a more volatile, dramatic up and down swings,” said Wayne Chen, CEO and director of Interlapse Technologies, a fintech firm.

The one-month metric oscillated largely in the range of -30% to 50% for 12 months before rising to record highs above 60% on June 30. The data indeed shows that bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 is somewhat inconsistent.

The one-year correlation has also risen to lifetime highs above 37%, according to Skew. One should note, though, that readings between 30% to 50% imply a relatively weak correlation between variables.

“Bitcoin, by all accounts, is still a risk asset. Despite those who may tout its fundamental similarities to gold, it has not yet proven to be a sufficient hedge or a flight to safety in times of risk-off sentiment,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Risk assets are the those with fortunes tied to the state of the global economy. For instance, prices of stocks and industrial metals like copper tend to rise when the global economic growth rate is expected to pick up pace and falter during an economic slowdown.

Bitcoin has more or less behaved like a risk asset this year. The cryptocurrency’s price fell from $10,000 to $3,867 in the first half of March, as global equities cratered on coronavirus fears. It then rose back toward $10,000 in the following two months as the S&P 500 saw its fastest bear market recovery on record.

However, being treated as a risk asset may be a blessing in disguise for bitcoin.

“Given that the correlation between BTC and equities is still so high, our expectation is that this is only bullish for bitcoin price in the short term, as global markets benefit from an unprecedented amount of monetary stimulus,” said Dibb.

Indeed, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are injecting massive amounts of fiat liquidity into their respective economies to counter the COVID-19 slowdown. As of last week, the Fed’s balance sheet size was $7.01 trillion – up 67% from $4.24 trillion in early March, according to data provided by the St. Louis Federal Reserve.

HODLing keeps rising

While bitcoin is struggling to establish itself as a haven asset, some investors remain undeterred.

“HODLers,” or long-term holders of bitcoin, as gauged by the number of addresses storing bitcoin for at least 12 months, rose to a lifetime high of 20.3 million in June. That surpassed the previous high of 19.52 million reached in May, as per IntoTheBlock, a blockchain intelligence company.

“With the halving just recently complete, many holders believe that Bitcoin’s median price should be a lot higher than the current value. This creates more of a hodl type of behaviour until the market starts building steam again,” said Chen.

The metric set a new record high for the 12th straight month in June. Notably, the number of holders is up 22% year on year, even though bitcoin’s price is down 25% over the same period.

For that, it’s essential to lower the threshold for the exchange between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies in order to cover users in more countries and regions,” said Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx. “The cooperation with Settle Network is of strategic significance to OKEx. Latin American users can now purchase BTC and ETH with multiple local currencies in a compliant way through bank transfers. In the future, OKEx will continue to expand the coverage of fiat currencies to allow more users to purchase cryptocurrencies more conveniently.”

OKEx notes that currently about 2 billion adults worldwide do not have bank accounts or are under-banked and Latin America occupies a large proportion.

Be that as it may, thanks to the its intermediary-free nature, cryptocurrency has begun to play an increasingly important role in the field of financial services.

For most people, the first step to enjoying blockchain-driven financial services is to convert local currencies to cryptocurrencies. As of now, OKEx has supported a vast majority of fiat currencies worldwide. Thanks to the partnership with Settle Network, through its wide array of products such as Latamex, Settle X, and PSP Xramp, etc, OKEx users will enjoy an much improved experience in crypto-to-fiat trading and payment process through bank transfer.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-court-bitcoin-theft-not-crime/,"Russian Court: Bitcoin Theft Not a Crime

A Russian district court has dismissed bitcoin theft as a crime since cryptocurrency is not regulated in Russia and there is no legal status for bitcoin. The accused were found guilty, sentenced to prison, and ordered to return only the fiat money stolen — not cryptocurrencies.

St. Petersburg’s Petrogradsky District Court has announced the verdict in a theft case involving bitcoin filed in December, the joint press service of the judicial system of St. Petersburg announced on Tuesday.

The two accused, Peter Piron and Yevgeny Prigozhin, disguised as officers of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) in 2018, forced the plaintiff to transfer cash and cryptocurrencies to them. Under the threat of torture, the cryptocurrency owner transferred five million rubles and cryptocurrencies, including 99.7035 bitcoins. The BTC was worth more than 48 million rubles ($680,640) based on the exchange rate on June 3, 2018, the court announcement details. Currently, this amount of BTC is worth about $908,024. The other cryptocurrencies amounted to approximately 7 million rubles, bringing the total loss suffered by the plaintiff to more than 60 million rubles.

The victim sought the return of all properties stolen. The court admitted that cryptocurrencies were transferred to the accused under threat. However, citing information from the central bank, the Bank of Russia, and the criminal code, the court concluded:

Cryptocurrency [theft] is not a crime against property. Due to the lack of legal status, it is not possible to recognize it as an object of civil law.

“This type of virtual money does not fall into any category and is not a recognized means of payment in the territory of the Russian Federation. The legislator has assigned it to surrogates of funds,” the court added.

Prigozhin was sentenced to eight years and Prion 10 years in a maximum-security prison. They have also been ordered to return the five million rubles, but the cryptocurrencies worth 55 million rubles at the time of the theft were excluded from the verdict.

Russia still has no cryptocurrency regulation even though a bill on digital financial assets was submitted to the State Duma back in March 2018. Recently, a bill was proposed to outlaw cryptocurrencies with a jail term, but several ministries do not support this bill.

The United States tax agency has published a request for information pertaining to privacy-centric cryptocurrencies and technologies that obfuscate crypto transactions. The IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit request is also asking for information in relation to “layer two offchain protocol networks, sidechains, and the Schnorr Signature algorithm.”

A recently published IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit request that’s available for public viewing is requesting information from “industry partners” in regards to crypto assets that leverage privacy techniques and other types of protocols that hide transaction data. The Request for Information (RFI) was published on June 30, 2020, and the RFI is dubbed “Pilot IRS Cryptocurrency Tracing.”

The IRS-CI request states:

This RFI is associated with a pilot IRS Criminal Investigation Division (CI) program. CI Cyber Crimes is requesting information about systems that will allow developers and testers to conduct investigative research of distributed ledger transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins.

The privacy-centric crypto tokens mentioned in the IRS-CI request include “monero (XMR), zcash (ZEC), dash (DASH), grin (GRIN), komodo (KMD), verge (XVG), and horizon (ZEN). Alongside this, the IRS wants data concerning offchain networks and sidechains like “Lightning Network (LN), Raiden Network, Celer Network, Plasma, Omisego,” and coins that have integrated the Schnorr Signature algorithm like bitcoin cash (BCH).

The United States tax agency says the entity currently has little knowledge of these protocols and is looking to build its expertise. The IRS would also like to leverage applications that allow them to investigate these privacy tools and coins.

“Acquiring applications to allow an investigation to more easily trace privacy coins and other protocols that provide anonymity to illicit actors would allow investigations to be more effective, as well as facilitate a higher level of deterrence by making it harder to conceal criminal activity. It also provides an investigative efficiency that is currently limited,” the IRS request notes.

Similarly, there are only a “few investigative resources” that allow investigators to intercept or trace transactions involving “Layer 2 network protocol transactions [and] sidechain ledgers.” Including “distributed ledgers that are adopting signature algorithms that provide privacy to illicit actors.”

The IRS notes in the request that the use of privacy coins and offchain/sidchain networks are “becoming more popular for general use.” But also the tax agency is “seeing an increase in use by illicit actors.”

However, not all mining firms have fared well throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with Canaan’s stock falling nearly 70% since early January, and both Hut 8 and DMG Blockchain seeing scant YTD gains despite experiencing significant volatility this year.

Mining firms outperform Bitcoin

While Bitcoin is up more than 26% from roughly $7,200 to $9,100 since the start of the year, the leading cryptocurrency’s gains have been dramatically overshadowed by a handful of firms mining it.

Hive Blockchain has seen a dramatic performance this year, rallying more than 420% from the start of 2020 until mid-February, from $0.066 to $0.345. The firm’s shares crashed back to $0.118 over the next month as immediate economic fallout from the coronavirus took effect. However, an expansion that led to Hive doubling its mining capacity saw its stock rebound to test the $0.033 area by mid-May.

HIVE/CAD 2020 YTD: Google

The firm’s shares have since fallen back to $0.228.

After starting the year trading for $1.22, Riot Blockchain shares rallied to $1.60 by mid-February before crashing to $0.65 in roughly one month. However, Riot produced a strong recovery, gaining over 375% to trade for $3.10 on June 10. The firm’s shares have since retraced to $2.29.

RIOT/CAD 2020 YTD: Google

Riot’s recovery may have been boosted by announcements in May that its mining revenues had grown 70% in the first quarter year-on-year, its plans to roughly double its hash rate after Bitcoin’s block reward halving, and the dismissal of pump-and-dump complaints against the firm.

Riot also expanded its total hash rate capability after establishing a hosting arrangement for its Antminer S17s with fellow mining firm Coinmint in April after facing disruptions resulting from COVID-19.

Canaan’s shares plummet in 2020

However, the gains enjoyed by Riot and Hive are certainly not indicative of all miners, with Canaan suffering huge losses over 2020 so far.

After starting the year at $6.02, Canaan shed over a quarter of its value by mid-Feb — when a sudden spike pushed prices up to $8.04 in a single day. Canaan’s stock then plummeted to $2.81 in mid-March, before embarking on a steady recovery to retest $6 two months later.

RIOT/USD 2020 YTD: Google

Since May 14, Canaan’s price has crashed by more than two-thirds to currently trade for $1.82.

While the YTD performance for Hut 8 and DMG Blockchain are currently sitting at an approximate break-even, both firms have seen extreme volatility during 2020.

HUT/CAD 2020 YTD: Google

Both Riot and DMG produced sudden spikes of over 60% in February followed by crashes of at least 60% by mid-March and a recovery back to trade at early-January levels.

Research has found that cryptocurrencies are three 1 times more popular, as a long-term investment vehicle, among millennials as compared to any other generation.

A survey conducted in the United Kingdom of affluent millennials discovered that 20% have invested in cryptocurrencies. The survey revealed that among the people born between 1981 and 1996, 20% had invested in the crypto space provided they had investable assets of £25,000 or more. This is significantly greater than the national average of 3%. Moreover, it is higher than 29% for millennials with over £75,000 in investable assets.

Millennials are Killing Traditional Industries

Some of the key reasons why millennials are switching towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to serve as an investment vehicle are:

High Returns of Bitcoin:

In the past, Bitcoin has consistently earned higher returns as compared to stocks, except in 2018. Even if a person bought Bitcoins at its all-time high and held it for life, her portfolio would be positive.

Over the last ten years FTSE 100 (index that represents the top 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange - LSE) gave a 7.38% annualised return. This is even though annual returns range from -8.73% to +19.07%. During the same period, Bitcoin investors have lost money only on 11% of the days, while profiting the rest of 89%.

Following are the annual returns of Bitcoin from 2011 to 2018:

2011: +1,473%

2012: +186%

2013: +5,507%

2014: -58%

2015: +35%

2016: +125%

2017: +1,331%

2018: -72%

2. Retirement portfolio item



Bitcoin is highly volatile, which can be corroborated by its 30-day gains and losses exceeding 100% on multiple occasions. However, millennials are still comfortable considering it as a retirement plan, because of two main reasons.

Firstly, millennials are a long way off from retirement so they can afford to take some risks. Secondly, they have lived through the housing crisis which was the result of bankers and brokers playing fast and loose with traditionally “safe” investments like stocks and houses. Bitcoin’s volatility and risk is not a big concern.

A study suggested that a 5% allocation of Bitcoin in a traditional portfolio comprising of 40% bonds and 60% stocks could more than double the portfolio returns over a four-year horizon.

3. Digital World

Millennials grew up with the evolution of the internet and have been moulded by it. They prefer paying by digital wallets and online banking, so Bitcoin, being the currency of the digital world, seems far more natural to a millennial.

Understanding Demography

An online poll conducted in 2019 found that people within 18 to 34 years of age were three times more likely to have familiarity with Bitcoin as compared to those over 65 and twice as likely as those between 50 to 64 years old. Thus, millennials outnumbered all age groups when it came to familiarity.

Moreover, 59% of millennials had a positive opinion about Bitcoin. This was twice as enthusiastic as the people aged 35 to 44 and thrice the number as in the case of people above 60yrs.

These findings are in-line with Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovations theory which depicts that innovators and early adopters of new technology are usually urban, educated and young.

Tap Global is tapping the Millennial Market

Considering that millennials are some of the largest players in the crypto space, it is essential to understand that these retail investors of today could be institutions of tomorrow.

Given the growing interest of millennials in cryptocurrency investing, new tools and platforms are required to facilitate the digital requirements of young investors.

Tap Global provides an entire crypto marketplace at your fingertips with its crypto banking app. Moreover, it provides advanced tools like real-time trading, the ability to view your holdings at a glance, seamless banking experience and the power to spend crypto with a tap.

Arsen Torosian, CEO of Tap Global, commented: “millennial investors are very eager to invest in cryptocurrency assets. Tap Global has already grown significantly since it’s public unveiling earlier this year and we are currently expanding in the UK and EU. Moreover, a survey conducted by Tap Global showed a majority of our user base consisting of individuals between the ages of 18yrs to 29yrs.”

Conclusion

Given the above factors, the growing millennial preference for cryptocurrency trading is less surprising than it would seem. The members of this generation distrust the stock market and prefer app-based digital investment alternatives like cryptocurrencies as it fits those preferences.

Moving forward, it's expected that an even greater proportion of millennials would favour crypto investments.

In brief Vitalik Buterin drew attention to the comparison between World War 2 and the cryptocurrency landscape.

Buterin said that Ethereum is perceived as the “mortal enemy” of Bitcoin supporters, while some believe that Tron is a copycat of Ethereum.

Buterin referred to a post discussing the in-group/out-group dynamics of World War II.

Just as battle lines were drawn between 1939 and 1945, similar lines were drawn across the crypto landscape in the eleven years since Bitcoin’s creation in 2008.

The analogy comes from Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin, who drew attention to the comparison in a Twitter post on July 3, in which he tried to explain the alliances that have formed in the crypto industry.

Buterin said that Ethereum is often considered the “mortal enemy” of Bitcoin supporters, while Tron (TRX) is spared the same scrutiny. Some believe that Tron is a copycat of Ethereum; it allegedly copied & pasted some of Ethereum’s code during its construction.

Buterin tweeted: “Like, from any serious point of view, any flaw that ETH has from the perspective of BTC community values, Tron has 10x more. And yet, ETH is often a mortal enemy, and yet Tron, at least psychologically, is viewed as a distant crazy uncle it's cool to be kinda friends with.”

Nazis, Jews, and Japanese...

Buterin referred to a post posted on Slate Star Codex by philosopher and psychologist Scott Alexander. The post discusses the in-group/out-group dynamics of different peoples during World War 2.

Seen below, it argues that, despite many shared biological, social and cultural features, the German Nazis chose to persecute German Jews, while they were only too willing to cooperate with the culturally different Japanese.

The only explanation for such a partnership is a strategic alliance, argued the post.

In Buterin’s wild analogy, fervent Bitcoin supporters are the German Nazis; Ethereum supporters are the German Jews, and Tron—Japan—appears to be forming a strategic alliance with Bitcoiners to take down a common enemy. After all, Tron CEO Justin Sun has spent the last few years referring to Tron as the “Ethereum Killer”.

Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine in 2011, and originally planned to build Ethereum on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. With that in mind, one would expect some level of accord between Ethereum and Bitcoin.

But alas, it was not to be. Could it be that “crazy uncle” Tron isn’t seen as a threat to Bitcoin, while Ethereum is?",2020-07-04 12:24:45,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/07/04/top-bitcoin-btc-analyst-says-altcoin-breakout-imminent-predicts-ethereum-xrp-litecoin-and-six-crypto-assets-set-for-major-rallies/,"Crypto strategist Nicholas Merten says altcoins are poised to rise up against Bitcoin as large-market cap coins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC) begin to show signs of strength in their BTC pairs.

On the latest episode of DataDash, Merten looks at Ethereum and sees the cryptocurrency printing solid bullish signals against the king coin.

“These longer-term indicators are starting to showcase that we’re setting up for a reversal. If you just take a look at the price here, this is beautiful. This is exactly what we want to see. It’s nice sideways consolidation, higher lows, and again not any further sell-side activity. Now, all we’re looking for is for higher highs compared to what we have set back here in December of 2018.”

As for XRP, Merten believes the cryptocurrency is likely to face more pain in the short term, but he expects Ripple’s native token to trigger a parabolic rise against BTC once it completes a bullish pattern.

“It’s been over a year now that we have been in this descending wedge and I have no doubt it is probably going to be another couple of weeks maybe another month or so until we really get a break on it. After that, that is when we can start to see the kind of volatile kick up to the upside and we start to get almost a parabolic rise here for cryptocurrencies.”

Turning his attention to Litecoin, Merten says the coin also offers a large upside against Bitcoin once it dips to his tried and tested buy zone.

“When we get down to that range, it is either instantly uplifted – buyers start coming in around this price range – or a matter of less than a week. After that, we kick off what is about a 400% gain against Bitcoin.”

Merten says smaller altcoins have more room to grow against Bitcoin. He believes Kyber Network (KNC), Ren (REN), Aave (LEND), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Kava (KAVA), and iExe RLC (RLC) are ripe to ignite after a period of short-term retracement or consolidation.

The crypto strategist believes the six coins are solid long-term picks that offer the potential to print outsized gains in their BTC pairs compared to large-cap cryptocurrencies.

Although he’s feeling bullish, Merten also notes the unpredictability of the crypto market at large and says anything can happen in the volatile and risky space.

More than 2,500 merchants in Austria can accept three types of cryptocurrencies via the payment processor Salamantex. The company explained that the system was tested with a number of select A1 5Gi network shops.

Since the Covid-19 outbreak, contactless payments have been trending more so than they ever were before. There are a number of traditional services that remove cash from the equation, but cryptocurrencies also provide the same ends except the means are decentralized.

This week the Austrian payment processor Salamantex announced that 2,500 merchants in the country will be able to support three different crypto assets via the system. The three supported assets include ethereum (ETH) dash (DASH) and bitcoin (BTC).

“Owners of [cryptocurrencies like] bitcoin and dash can be excited. From this summer on, they can spend their coins at more than 2,500 merchants using [the] A1 Payment service – provided the merchant has activated the feature,” Salamantex wrote.

The Salamantex team also mentioned how Austrians really like cash, but Covid-19 has changed that trend a great deal. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Austrians were extremely proud of cash and this was reflected in a large poll during the parliamentary election in late September 2019. One young Austrian woman interviewed during the poll said she liked cash because “you don’t leave a trace.”

“Although Austria is traditionally a country with a high affinity for cash, the last few months have led to a mind shift after people were called upon by the government and retailers to primarily switch to cashless payment transactions as far as possible,” the Salamantex announcement detailed. The company added:

With the integration of the Salamantex service software into the complete A1 payment package, Austrian retailers can now offer another payment option and thereby accept common cryptocurrencies.

Crypto assets have seen wider adoption in recent weeks, as news.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the Australia Post providing bitcoin (BTC) purchases via Bitcoin.com.au. Further, Centrapay revealed 2,000 Coca-Cola brand vending machines in Australia and New Zealand that now support BTC payments.

Salamantex COO, Markus Pejacsevich is trying to usher in the same type of crypto payment adoption in Austria.

“Our goal is to make paying with digital currencies at the checkout as easy and natural as we have been used to with credit cards for decades,” Pejacsevich said. “The acceptance of cryptocurrencies opens up new affluent customer groups and enables merchants to position themselves as pioneers in their industry.”

The main one is the connection between crypto and crime. Everyone who has studied this topic even superficially knows that Bitcoin (BTC) still remains a popular payment method among scammers and criminals on the darknet. Cryptocurrencies are very convenient tools for money laundering, evading taxes and cheating investors.

Today, I will talk about the most famous cryptocurrency pyramids, from which millions of investors suffered and whose activities amounted to billions of dollars in losses. These companies worked on Ponzi schemes, named after an Italian fraudster of the early 20th century. These pyramids do not produce goods and do not provide services — all they do is network marketing, where each member of the pyramid invites several new ones that invite the next ones and so on.

The only people involved who manage to earn in such a system are the organizers and some early investors who managed to withdraw their money in time. The remaining participants in the pyramid are left without money, with debts, or in the case of cryptocurrency pyramids, with no valuable tokens.

OneCoin

OneCoin is considered one of the largest cryptocurrency pyramids, which functioned from 2014 to 2017, deceiving about three million people and defrauding investors of around $5 billion in total. The founder of One Coin is the Bulgarian fraudster Ruzha Ignatova. The pyramid worked according to the classical Ponzi scheme, in which participants receive a reward for each new person invited.

The scammer convinced her audience that OneCoin would soon become the most influential cryptocurrency in the world. There were even promises to “kill Bitcoin.” It is worth noting that her coin did not even have its own blockchain and was accepted only on sites associated with the pyramid.

For the first time, the Bulgarian government spoke about the threat from fraudsters by publishing a message about the risks of participating in OneCoin, since the project is not a financial instrument and is not controlled by regulators. This caused the pyramid to “leave” the country and refuse to work with Bulgarian banks.

But soon, criticism and warnings about participating in the scheme came from the United Kingdom, Austria and Thailand. Italy and Germany even banned the activities of OneCoin in the countries and blocked their accounts. Ignatova simply did not attend the next announced meeting with investors in Lisbon, and was never seen again. There is no information on her whereabouts.

The United States government has charged Ruzha Ignatova with fraud and money laundering. While she faces 25 years of imprisonment, law enforcement officers still managed to arrest some of her accomplices, among whom include her lawyer, brother and former business partner.

BitConnect

Another major crypto pyramid functioned from 2016 to 2018: BitConnect. It was created by unknown developers and led by a man named Satao Nakamoto.

Participants had to buy BCC tokens and lock them on a special platform, and the trading bot had to earn profit automatically. Members of the pyramid were promised 40% in profit per month. According to the organizers of BitConnect, from an initial investment of $1,000, investors could expect to withdraw $50 million in three years’ time.

The first critic of the pyramid was Vitalik Buterin, who drew attention to the fact that the promise of 1% profit per day is a classic Ponzi scheme. After some time, Mike Novogratz and Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee agreed with the opinion of the founder of Ethereum. At the same time, questions for the organizers of BitConnect came from the United Kingdom government, which demanded the company to reveal its business model. Yet, this did not prevent fraudsters from participating in crypto events and attracting new investors.

The U.S. authorities helped to end this story, calling BitConnect a financial pyramid and demanding that it cease operations. After that, the BCC token fell by 90%, investors were left with a total loss of $3.5 billion, and one of the organizers of the pyramid was behind bars. Divayesh Darji, the head of the Indian branch of BitConnect, did, however, come out on bail in 2019.

PlusToken

The youngest and largest financial pyramid in recent years. Founded in 2018, the pyramid was advertised in Chinese WeChat with promises of 10%–30% of return on investment per month. Around four million people became participants in the PlusToken ponzi scheme. Fraudsters allegedly advocated financial literacy and trained people to use cryptocurrencies, but ultimately aimed to convert them to Plus tokens.

In this case, justice still overtook the organizers of the scheme, and a year ago, six of them were arrested at the request of Chinese authorities. However, the $3 billion lost by investors could not be returned, and remains with the PlusToken team members. More recently, on June 22, all EOS was withdrawn from the pyramid’s wallets, and soon enough, this was repeated with all ETH tokens.

Despite the fact that these pyramids have practically ceased their activity, their various “reincarnations” constantly appear, attracting inexperienced investors. The government cannot forever protect citizens from such schemes, since prohibition requires proof of a crime. In this case, the best defense is knowledge. If everyone could recognize the huge profit margins promised by companies in exchange for investment as a red flag rather than a gold mine, there would be significantly fewer fraudsters.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has a new president as Germany took over the presidency from China. The intergovernmental organization also highlighted the need for more guidance on cryptocurrencies as many countries have not yet fully implemented its revised crypto standards. Another review has also been announced.

Germany Now Leads FATF

The FATF has a new president, Dr. Marcus Pleyer of Germany, who succeeded Xiangmin Liu of China. Pleyer serves as Deputy Director General in Germany’s Ministry of Finance. His two-year term as the president of the anti-money laundering watchdog began on June 1.

Pleyer presented his objectives at the lastest FATF virtual plenary, which took place on June 24 and published on Wednesday. Regarding the organization’s “new standards on virtual assets,” he declared: “The German Presidency intends to build on this work, focusing on the opportunities that technology can offer, by launching an initiative to monitor risks and explore opportunities.” Compared to China, Germany is much more crypto-friendly; the country began regulating the industry early this year and at least 40 banks in the country have reportedly expressed interest in offering crypto services.

At the plenary, the FATF also revealed the outcome of the 12-month review it conducted on how each country implemented its new cryptocurrency standards. Overall, “both the public and private sectors have made progress in implementing the revised FATF standards, in particular in the development of technological solutions to enable the implementation of the ‘travel rule’ for VASPs [virtual asset service providers],” the intergovernmental organization detailed.

While insisting that there is currently no need for revised standards on crypto assets, the FATF “did highlight the need for further guidance on virtual assets and VASPs.” The FATF believes, “This will help members of the FATF global network, many of whom have not yet fully implemented the revised standards, to make the necessary progress,” noting:

The FATF will continue its enhanced monitoring of virtual assets and VASPs by undertaking a second 12 month review by June 2021.

The subject of stablecoins was also discussed at the plenary, “particularly those that have the potential to be mass-adopted,” often referred to by regulators as “global stablecoins.” An example of a global stablecoin is the cryptocurrency libra, originally proposed by social media giant Facebook. The FATF has prepared a report on global stablecoins for the G20 as requested. The anti-money laundering watchdog believes that global stablecoins “could potentially cause a shift in the virtual asset ecosystem and have implications for money laundering and terrorist financing risks.”

The FATF further confirmed that its crypto standards apply to stablecoins and no amendments to the standards are required at this time. Nonetheless, it recognizes that “this is a rapidly evolving area and that it is essential to continue to closely monitor the ML/TF [money laundering/terrorism financing] risks of so-called stablecoins, including anonymous peer-to-peer transactions via unhosted wallets.”

Image: Shutterstock

In brief The man known as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" explained on a recent podcast how encryption technology could either help or hinder the growing surveillance state.

Roger Ver, Executive Chairman of Bitcoin.com, believes it would be wiser to place our trust in mathematics, rather than government or corporate agencies.

Ver urges developers to build the tools that would make the possibility of intrusive surveillance a thing of the past.

The man known as “Bitcoin Jesus”, Roger Ver, laid out his vision of heaven and hell for the future of the cryptocurrency space in a recent podcast appearance.

Speaking on the Follow the White Rabbit podcast, Ver told host Alex Kehaya that emerging technological systems like cryptocurrency could swing the fate of personal sovereignty either way.

Roger Ver is a vocal Bitcoin Cash supporter and the Executive Chairman of Bitcoin.com. He gained the moniker of “Bitcoin Jesus” thanks to his investments in multiple cryptocurrency startups in the early days following Bitcoin’s creation.

Referring to persistent intrusions on the privacy of citizens by the US government—with help from corporations like Apple and Google—Ver said cryptocurrency could return informational control back to the individual.

“My biggest hope is that these new technological systems will enable people to have more control of their own lives, and more control of their own destiny, their own privacy, and their own information,” Ver told Kehaya.

However, Ver admits the same technology could be used to extend the surveillance state even further. After all, public blockchains leave a breadcrumb trail of transactions that can be used to monitor an individual’s financial transactions.

“My biggest nightmare is that it will be the exact opposite. It could wind up being either of those things, and it’s up to us to figure out which one of those paths we go down,” said Ver. The Chinese government, for example, has long admitted its desire to use blockchain to monitor its citizens' interactions.

Bitcoin Jesus: trust mathematics, not governments

One feature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they require no authoritative overseer. According to Ver, the encryption technology that blockchains brought to the fore stand to become a far more trustworthy “authority” than any human element.

In short, Ver believes mathematics makes a better master than internet service providers and governments. He said: “If you have to trust someone not to disclose your information, that doesn’t work out very well. So I’m a much bigger fan of building the tools—like encryption software—where you don’t have to trust anyone.”

Ver added: “You can rely on the rules of mathematics to know that you’re not being spied on, rather than having to trust your ISP, or trust your government not to be spying on you.”

The solution, said Ver, is simple. “Let’s build the tools where you don’t have to trust other people not to be spying on you,” he said.",2020-07-04 15:40:18,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-8479633/Millions-Britons-hold-cryptocurrency-like-bitcoin.html,"Not so long ago, sandwiched somewhere in between the EU referendum and the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies briefly became the hottest global topic.

With prices soaring, many blindly took a punt, worried they would miss out on a chance for a quick and large profit – the only way was up and all that Yazz.

You heard overheard conversations about buying bitcoin, ripple, ethereum and more everywhere. It seemed everyone was piling in, young and old, with the hopes of turning hundreds or thousands of pounds into something more substantial.

Many subsequently had their fingers burnt – bitcoin prices fell from a peak of nearly $20,000 in December 2017 to $3,000 a year later, others saw their currency vanish, exchanges disappear, or were scammed.

Bitcoin boom? The FCA has provided a snapshot of crypto Britain

A lucky few, likely to have been involved when the price was low and the industry unknown, may have turned a handsome profit.

Fast forward to today and while cryptocurrencies remain niche, there is still plenty of interest around bitcoin and the like, with ways to buy it far easier than a few years ago.

And for those who managed to buy in at $3,000 a coin in that dip a year after the boom and held on, they would have witnessed the price triple.

We see comments dominated by two extreme camps: those who say bitcoin will race to $100,000, or even a $1million a coin in the next few years, and others saying it is a scam or casino-style gambling, with those getting involved having no idea what it is all about.

The Financial Conduct Authority has taken a keen interest in recent years and this week marked its annual report on the cryptocurrency, to reveal whether the interest in bitcoin has died down or continues to boom.

Consumer Trends dives into the statistics to see whether the fad is over, or if people are more interested than ever…

Who is a typical crypto holder?

Around 1.9million Britons own cryptocurrencies, according to the new data from the FCA – or nearly 4 per cent of the adult population.

These are people who actually 'own' a coin in a wallet, not have their money tracking the price.

A further 700,000 people have also held crypto at some point, or 5.35 per cent of Britons – up 2.35 percentage points on a year earlier.

That means more than one in 20 Britons have been tempted into dabbling in crypto at some point.

What about the price? The price of bitcoin soared from $1,000 a coin in early 2017 to $20,000 by the end of the year. A year later, it had fallen to $3,000. Last summer, it managed a spell back over $10,000 a coin, it fell back to $6,000 in March and currently sits at around $9,000. According to the study, 78 per cent of all people had heard of bitcoin. The next most familiar? Libra, which hasn't launched, followed by bitcoin cash, ether, bitcoin SV and litecoin - these were the only ones with a 10 per cent or more familiarity with the British public.

The data, which was gathered in December 2019, also showed that people were far more likely to have heard of cryptocurrency: nearly three quarters are now aware of it, compared to just 42 per cent a year before.

What is the make-up of a typical punter and how much have they gambled of their own cash?

Well, 79 per cent are male, 69 per cent over the age of 35 and the majority – 73 per cent - are classed as being in the highest ABC1 social grades.

Furthermore, nearly half of cryptocurrency holders earn £20,000 to £50,000, with exactly half of all owners holding under £260 worth and 75 per cent under £1,000.

This suggests that most have dipped their toes in the market in the hope of a crypto like bitcoin rising to $100,000 a coin.

If you bought £260 worth today, and it did - for whatever reason - rise to $100,000 a coin, it would see the value rise to around £3,000 from that initial investment.

It is small enough for most to write it off if needed, but big enough to have more than a passing interest.

The most popular reason for consumers buying cryptocurrencies was as 'as a gamble that could make or lose money', acknowledging that prices are volatile.

There has also been a shifting generational change – just 7 per cent of all crypto holders were 55-plus in 2018. Despite seeing largely as a millennial or generation Z purchsae, this figure has increased to 22 per cent in the new study.

Meanwhile, the number of 18-24 year-olds involved dropped from 18 per cent to 10 per cent.

The most likely age range to hold crypto now is 35 to 44 year-olds at 27 per cent.

The year previous, 25-34 year-olds were most likely, at 39 per cent. The survey is of a nationally representative online panel of 3,085 respondents.

Money, money, money: Half of those with cryptocurrency have less than £260 worth

Some have borrowed money to get involved

In the survey, the FCA used the term cryptocurrency, but notes: 'This term is more widely used in public domain than the broader ""cryptoasset"" term we tend to prefer'.

This highlights that the city watchdog would prefer it not to be described as a form of currency.

The survey indicated that 8 per cent of people borrowed the money from financial firms, friends and family, other sources or using a credit card or existing credit facility.

While this seems a low percentage, the FCA says this is still 215,000 people. For a speculative investment, that is a worrying figure.

It does point out, however, that those who did borrow money purchased small amounts – half bought less than £120 worth.

Another titbit from the survey is that fact that 27 per cent of people who bought crypto are in the C2DE social grade.

These are described as skilled manual workers, semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers, state pensioners, casual and lowest grade workers and unemployed with state benefits only.

The FCA concluded that those displaying a lack of basic knowledge and are unaware of the absence of regulatory protections are more likely to be in this social grade than the typical cryptocurrency owner.

On that note, most consumers seem to understand the risks associated with the lack of protections, the high volatility of the product and have some understanding of the underlying technology, the study says.

Nevertheless, the lack of such knowledge among some presents potential consumer harm - 11 per cent of current and previous cryptocurrency owners thought their money was protected.

Again, while the minority, it still amounts to approximately 300,000 adults.

Nearly half of people said they bought crypto as a gamble that could make or lose money. Just 15 per cent expected to make money quickly.

A quarter have bought in as a part of a wider investment portfolio, while a similar number said they did as they feared missing the boat.

Meanwhile, 17 per cent said they have got involved as they don't trust the financial system and the same amount did as part of a long-term savings plan, such as a pension.

Earnings: It appears basic-rate taxpayers are the most likely to hold crypto

Never been used and use non-UK exchanges

According to the study, 47 per cent of people have never used cryptocurrency for anything.

This suggests that many are buying it and holding it in the hope of the value growing, not for any practical use.

Last month saw the announcement that PayPal will begin supporting bitcoin transactions - which may change all that.

The majority bought their crypto through an online exchange. Of those that used an online exchange, 83 per cent used non-UK based exchanges.

While there are plenty of reputable exchanges, as we've pointed out before, it can be the Wild West, with people potentially transferring their money overseas.

Coinbase is by far the most popular exchange to use - 63 per cent of those who have bought crypto used the San Francisco based firm.

The next four that most people use are Binance, based in Malta, Kraken, also in San Francisco, Bittrex in Seattle and Bitfinex, Hong Kong - the only other firms to score above 10 per cent.

Keen interest: A year ago, the majority never looked at their crypto value - now, most keep a keen eye on it

Are they holding it for the long-term?

In general, cryptocurrency holders expect to hold onto it for long periods of time - again, highlighting that most are now buying and leaving it, in the hope for long-term growth.

In the previous study, 35 per cent said they never monitored the value of their crypto holding - however, this has dropped to 12 per cent.

Most current owners who have a plan for how long they intend to hold crypto expect to keep them for three years or more.

At the same time, almost 40 per cent said they don't know for how long they will hold onto it.

Google trends data showing searches for bitcoin, with the big spike during the boom

Have more people got involved during lockdown?

It is highly likely that the number of people involved in cryptocurrencies has surged during lockdown, thanks to stock market volatility, savings rates collapsing and having extra cash.

There have been plenty of reports suggesting that some households have managed to save extra cash - much of which has poured into savings accounts or National Savings and Investment products.

Some of this would have been diverted into bitcoin. On 11 May, in the midst of lockdown, we also saw bitcoin half - an event that happens every four years.

It means the reward for digitally mining Bitcoin has halved from 12.5 coins per block to 6.25, constricting the supply.

The event saw some exchanges report an influx of investors, hoping to see prices surge after the event.

According to Google Trends, worldwide searches for bitcoin reached their highest amount since the halcyon days of late 2017 and early 2018, when crypto chat became all the rage.

This suggests that more Britons are likely to have piled in since the data in this report was gathered - but as the study suggests, the majority are wisely not expecting quick gains or sticking too much of their cash in crypto.",2020-07-04 09:25:14+01:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/why-cardano-could-still-fail-despite-the-excitement-around-shelley/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways After multiple and lengthy delays, Cardano plans to deliver Shelley on July 29.

Shelley alone is not going to fix all of Cardano’s issues.

The upcoming staking rewards are subpar compared to some DeFi lending, so it’s not a sustainable advantage for Cardano in the long term.

Cardano’s ecosystem is tiny compared to the competition, and its growth is hindered by the absence of smart-contracts.

Share this article

Like its competitors, Cardano has been active with updates in 2020. However, they may not be enough to stop the project from falling behind. Hence, ADA holders may experience another disappointment once the hype dies off.

Layer 1 Platforms Are Waking Up

The IEO craze of 2019 brought exchanges into the crypto spotlight. The reputation of a particular exchange meant more than the technological features of projects it promoted. A Binance-hosted IEO, for instance, would perform merely due to the platform’s clout.

In 2020, technology has recaptured headlines.

Layer 1 solutions represented by Ethereum and its “killers” are waking up. Ethereum 2.0 is looming, while projects like TRON are making notable progress on their base-layer solutions.

The blockchain space is still young and compared to traditional equities relatively small.

As a result, no platform has gained sufficient network effects to build a moat yet. But another battle between Layer 1 solutions is brewing. With a pipeline chock full of updates, Cardano is set to join the frontlines of the platform wars.⁠

The Cardano Approach

Cardano is frequently criticized for its slow progress. The team’s primary point of defense is that they choose to build a platform that’s reliable and secure from the start instead of “going fast and breaking things.”

The platform’s full decentralization phase, Shelley, adding more than a year to the Cardano roadmap. However, the team has been in touch with the community, assuring that the necessary work on it was being done. Now, the long wait is soon to be over.

From spring 2020, Cardano resumed updating its transition to Shelley. At the end of March, the team announced the Byron reboot, which brought crucial functionality to the network’s nodes. The reboot was followed by the launch of Shelley Testnet in May, fueling even more optimism.

During July 2-3, Cardano conducted a virtual conference, where Charles Hoskinson reflected on the work done and the future of the network.

The most important takeaway: Shelly is scheduled to launch on July 29.

In Hoskinson’s view, lengthy protocol development is justified by supercharged growth once all the features are tested and rolled out. In reality, Cardano still may run into roadblocks, even if the rollout is flawless.

We’ve Been There Before

Although Cardano is gaining momentum, this needs to be taken with caution. Shelley was announced long before 2020, and delays burned traders.

Shelley’s release was initially scheduled for Q2-Q3, 2018. This makes up for almost a two-year delay if the team launches the upgrade in July 2020.

Unfulfilled expectations led to multiple instances of backlash from the community. The launch of staking in December 2019 helped to restore some trust, but doubts remain.

On a positive note, this time, Cardano now has stricter deadlines, which adds some extra credibility to the team’s claims.

Still, the project’s history of missing milestones calls for wariness about the speed of development after Shelley is launched.

Shelley Is not the Ultimate Solution

From a technological standpoint, Cardano lags behind the leading Layer 1 platforms like Ethereum, Tron, and EOS. The advent of Shelley won’t create a technological edge; it won’t even put Cardano on par with the competitors.

Shelley is merely a decentralized version of Cardano with delegation and staking. The smart contract functionality is reserved for Goguen, which at this time still does not have a release date.

It will be difficult for Cardano to find a compelling use case without smart contracts amid the DeFi frenzy of 2020, something Ripple suffers from as well.

Meanwhile, other Layer 1 platforms will capitalize on the current trend, leaving Cardano behind.

Nevertheless, yield farmers may still consider Cardano.

Although staking has been foreshadowed by DeFi lending, it still provides a worthy alternative to traditional fixed income instruments.

What’s in It for Holders?

Shelley enables staking, making Cardano a proxy for earning passive income. Since December 2019, staking has been available on the Incentivized Testnet with roughly 1,000 stake pools competing for users’ tokens.

At this point, staking is only available to users who had tokens in their possession before November 2019, when the snapshot for Shelley Incentivized Testnet (ITN) took place. The rewards are currently only available on the testnet and will be distributed and tradable when Shelley hits the mainnet.

ITN has over 13 billion test-ADA staked, which represents over 40% of the total supply. Keep in mind, the snapshot happened just once, and it didn’t force users to keep their tokens to be eligible for rewards.

For example, if a user had 1,000 ADA at the time of the snapshot and sold them afterward, they would still be eligible for rewards on 1,000 ADA.

The way ITN is arranged makes it hard to evaluate the real demand for staking. Existing users may have liquidated their holdings, while new users cannot start staking.

According to Cardano’s official rewards calculator, staking $1,000 in ADA would yield around a 10% annual return. However, different staking pools have different performance and fees, so this number may fluctuate substantially, as some users have reported.

A 10% annual return is close to the market average for blockchains with staking.

However, once staking rewards kick in, the returns may induce inflation if users sell these rewards on the market. If users stick to staking, it will create a potentially dangerous situation of a severe sell-off once some pool decides to cash out.

ADA volatility and the max potential drawdown don’t instill optimism about long-term staking.

While volatility may be acceptable for some, yearly max drawdowns have been devastating. Fortunately, ADA can be unstaked relatively quickly, but it’s still a suboptimal passive income solution compared to lending stablecoins.

Overall, while the advent of staking on Cardano looks exciting on the surface, it’s less appealing after some scrutiny. It makes sense for risk-tolerant speculators but doesn’t look very good for conservative investors.

Finally, ITN staking rewards may create substantial selling pressure once they are available on the mainnet at the beginning of August 2020.

The Deserted Chain

Cardano’s on-chain activity is almost non-existent compared to its close competitors Ethereum and Tron. It has around 4,000 daily transactions, while each rival scores roughly 1 million. EOS is also a contender, but rampant spam transactions from bots make it hard to compare.

On the bright side, there has been an influx of users lately, who are likely coming in anticipation of staking.

Jumpstarting Cardano Activity With Money

The Cardano team is committed to spending at least $30 million on community and ecosystem development.

While this may help increase on-chain activity, some of Cardano’s similar initiatives failed to get traction before. For example, the project’s business development arm, EMURGO, launched an accelerator, dLab, in 2018. While some of dLab’s portfolio projects are up and running off-chain, they bring little to Cardano itself as there is still no smart contract functionality.

Building on-chain infrastructure will require a vibrant community of developers, and Cardano largely locks people into using Haskell.

While formal programming languages aren’t widespread in blockchain development, it’s not without reason. Haskell isn’t very popular overall. For example, only 3% of developers polled by JetBrains in 2019 used Haskell in the previous 12 months.

Betting on a language preference is questionable. For instance, IOST’s bet was on JavaScript and Go—popular languages with thousands of developers—and wasn’t able to grow its community like Ethereum, which is written in Solidity.

Cardano has a long way to go until its ecosystem becomes competitive. At the moment, it’s growth is slowed mainly by the absence of smart contract capabilities. The upcoming Shelley update is unlikely to fix this.

Performance and Sustainability

ADA has enjoyed substantial growth, making almost 5x from its march lows; it even outperformed Ethereum.

But the big question is whether or not the price momentum is sustainable.

Overall, Cardano is a fundamentally solid project with a lot of work put into it. It deserves the community’s appreciation and excitement. However, it has been too slow to deliver technological features and grow a community around them.

Speculative short-term staking may keep Cardano afloat in the short term. In the mid-to-long term, the project needs to accelerate its technological progress or risk losing everything to nimbler competitors.

I will assume, though, that because you are reading this you have an interest in markets and/or crypto assets. And because this is a newsletter aimed at professional investors, I will assume you care about a bit more than prices going up/down/sideways. That should put us on more or less the same page as to what we explore here.

However, this week I want us all to question the lens through which we judge the evolution of markets. Not just crypto markets – all markets, because it is becoming increasingly clear that sooner or later the distinction will be irrelevant.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view.

What those markets look like is relevant, though, and I am increasingly aware my view on that may be influenced by my age. So might yours. It could be useful, then – perhaps even fun if not slightly discomforting – to try to see the evolution of markets from the point of view of a different generational label.

Here’s an example: Many market observers, myself included, have been celebrating the emergence of prime brokerage services that have clout and experience. The latest to join the growing list of big names is London-based B2C2, which started providing over-the-counter liquidity to crypto markets in 2015, and this week announced a partnership with and investment from Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings which will enable it to move towards adding prime services to its already active distribution.

We’re excited about this because it represents a maturation of the crypto markets and removes one of the significant barriers standing between institutions and crypto investment: the structural inefficiency of capital. Given a choice of crypto prime brokers with strong balance sheets, the reasoning goes, more institutions will be willing to participate, and the influx of demand and liquidity will push up asset prices. A new crypto market era could be dawning.

But what if the real dawning is coming from a totally different direction? What if a cultural shift is emerging that could end up reshaping traditional markets to look more like the crypto markets?

Young people

Generation Z is now the largest generation in the world, accounting for almost 30% of the U.S. population. They’re teenagers and in their early 20s, and most won’t be actively investing due to a lack of income and savings – but, according to surveys, they’re well-educated and politically active, and have been given a loud wake-up call when it comes to the need to protect whatever wealth they may accumulate.

They are also digital natives and, when they are old enough, will see nothing strange in allocating their savings to assets via swipes on their phones (or movements of their headsets or digital glasses, who knows). It is unlikely they will find the fragmented nature of crypto markets alarming, and the creativity of many crypto asset products on the market today could appeal to their strong sense of individualism.

What’s more, the young and future savers will come of investing age in perhaps the worst recession in generations, with employment security at record lows, markets increasingly divorced from fundamentals and growing doubts about the resilience of fiat currencies. They will have plenty of reason to question established financial wisdom, and plenty of opportunity to explore new investment formats.

Earlier this year, the Edelman Trust Barometer showed that confidence in governments, media and business is at record lows, and that over half of respondents believe that capitalism is failing them. While the poll does not cover Generation Z (survey participants are over 25), it would be a stretch to assume that the teenagers of today will emerge from cancelled classes and lockdown with their parents with greater faith in governments’ ability to protect them than their predecessors have.

Changing habits

Moving up the age scale a bit, you’ll have seen the headlines about the perceived influence millennials are having on the stock market via apps such as Robinhood. The day-trading frenzy may disappear should prices crash, but the underlying gamification will most likely create investment habits that will persist as a new generation of investors enters the market.

This will be supported by the continuing separation of market prices from underlying value – why do investment homework when fundamentals don’t really matter any more?

What’s more, some experts claim Generation Z is the DIY generation and is therefore less likely than even millennials to use the services of professional investment advisers. YouTube, TikTok and social investment apps, where strategies are shared, give ample opportunity to mimic and learn from others.

(For the record, I have a Gen Z daughter who was not particularly helpful in my superficial research – she would never day trade, doesn’t trust banks and is excited about her meager bitcoin investment she holds in a hardware wallet. But she has no idea what her friends think about all this and would just die of embarrassment if I asked them.)

New markets

So, combine a distrust of centralized institutions with a high degree of comfort with digital platforms and a relative lack of respect for traditional financial expertise, and you have a generation with the potential to rewrite how markets work.

This generation will emerge into a market in which traditional investment standards no longer apply, and for which the word “unprecedented” has lost most of its meaning. They will do so without the clear asset differentiation that their parents and older siblings have relied on to make portfolio decisions.

True, their combined personal wealth is likely to be minuscule compared to the money managed by traditional institutions.

But these institutions are rarely immune to mainstream investment culture. They operate under different rules, with much less freedom as well as entrenched checks and balances. But most of them – pension funds, mutual fund managers, insurance companies – are there to serve retail investors. And their results will most likely be affected by the growing influence of retail investors on the market.

As the investing culture evolves, so will they. The result is likely to be an acceleration of the blurring of boundaries between traditional and new investing. Crypto markets are likely to increasingly look like traditional markets. But what traditional markets look like will also evolve, possibly beyond current recognition.

We could already be seeing signs of this happening. Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, the crypto OTC firm I mentioned earlier, hinted his firm was looking at trading other assets alongside cryptocurrencies. The market reach that the alliance with SBI Holdings gives B2C2 will push this amalgam into new areas, ready for a new generation of investors. It doesn’t hurt that SBI is the largest online brokerage in Japan, a country with an active retail investor baseknown for its contrarian thinking. B2C2 will facilitate the platform’s crypto asset trades.

This will not only continue to blur the lines between crypto and traditional asset investing. It will also continue to blur the lines between retail and institutional interest.

I, for one, plan to continue to get excited about big steps forward in the professionalization of crypto markets and in their appeal to institutional investors.

I will even more enjoy, however, watching the very nature of markets evolve. And I will be proud of the younger generation of investors helping to make this happen.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

As the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and around the world reaches all-time highs, hopes for a vaccine and a swift economic recovery continue to push markets higher.

True, every day that passes puts us one day closer to a vaccine being available for everybody. But between now and then there’s a lot of hurt coming, and we have no idea what the final cost will be. And markets are acting like the cost will be negligible.

Not all stocks are affected equally, however – the Nasdaq has now not only significantly outperformed the S&P 500 since the beginning of the year, it has also reached all-time highs, surpassing even the dot-com bubble.

This represents a widening gulf between tech stocks and more traditional industries, as well as an insidious shift in corporate priorities. It’s almost as if investors are encouraging companies to ignore the health of their balance sheet in favor of future earnings potential, especially in a market that assumes that potential defaults will be bailed out.

Bitcoin continues to trade in a relatively tight range, which some claim is a classic buildup to a breakout. That may be the case, but no one knows when that breakout will happen, or, for that matter, in what direction.

CHAIN LINKS

SBI Holdings has taken a $30 million stake in crypto OTC firm B2C2. TAKEAWAY: This positions B2C2 to enter the race to become one of the industry’s anchor prime brokers. Recently we have seen Genesis*, BitGo and Coinbase announce prime brokerage plans. With B2C2’s execution track record and SBI’s access to a range of other crypto asset services through various crypto industry investments, B2C2’s OTC clients could soon also be able to access a range of support functions including leverage and custody. The relationship will also improve crypto trading services for clients of SBI Securities, one of Japan’s largest online brokerages. (See more analysis above in THE BRIEFING.)

Bitcoin may seem to be more volatile than traditional assets but in crypto markets it is considered relatively stable compared to other cryptocurrencies. However, that pricing situation may change during the third quarter, according to options market data, which indicates that BTC volatility will be higher than that of ETH in coming months. TAKEAWAY: This is notable as, traditionally, ETH’s volatility is higher than that of BTC. It is also surprising, given the recent boost in activity in decentralized finance tokens that run on the Ethereum blockchain. The switch could be due to a build-up of expectations that BTC’s recent tight trading range will be broken with a sharp move. But, historically, except for the late 2017 run-up, periods in which ETH’s volatility has exceeded that of BTC have coincided with slumps in BTC’s price.

Crypto analyst and investor Chris Burniske hypothesized that, given the relentless rise of equity markets, we could well soon see a large crypto company go public, and that this would be a catalyst for greater mainstream interest in the industry. TAKEAWAY: It does sound plausible, and could be a catalyst not just for mainstream interest, but also for regulatory clarity from the SEC. Can’t have a splashy IPO for a company that operates in a sector whose regulatory future is uncertain, now, can we?

Crypto data firm Coin Metrics has revealed a new methodology for measuring the size and depth of digital asset markets, which involves excluding coins and tokens that have been inactive for over five years. TAKEAWAY: Given that some protocols intentionally lock up coins for long periods or have large founding treasuries, not all ecosystems can effectively use market capitalization as a meaningful gauge of size and depth. Also, in some older networks, a sizable portion of issued tokens have been lost. This makes it challenging to compare market capitalizations with a standardized measure – focusing just on “active” coins should remove some of the protocol-specific token management differences. One interesting result: Bitcoin’s free float is nearly 25% smaller than the commonly cited 18.4 million bitcoins issued to date.

Crypto data firm Glassnode produced a detailed look at the recent activity of bitcoin whales(entities with at least 1,000 BTC). TAKEAWAY: After declining since 2016, the number of BTC whales is increasing, as is the total balance held. What’s more, the market share of these whales is seeing its largest sustained increase since 2011, after declining for almost a decade. This growth implies growing confidence of long-term holders, supported by the apparent flow of BTC from exchanges into whale wallets.

Bitcoin miner Hut 8 has raised $8.3 million from selling a 6% equity stake to investors, approximately $800,000 more than the original funding target. TAKEAWAY: The raise itself is not surprising – my colleague Matt Yamamoto hinted it would be forthcoming in his in-depth report on Hut 8. And even though it ended up being higher than the original target, it is still small, and so should not cause significant dilution. Unless the bitcoin price appreciates significantly in the short term, it’s possible that Hut 8 will still need to find more financing for an equipment upgrade.

The stock-to-flow model that predicted strong price appreciation for bitcoin post-halving is not having its best moment.

Nico Cordeiro, CIO at fund manager Strix Leviathan, presents a detailed analysis that points out some fundamental flaws and misunderstood definitions of the stock-to-flow model of bitcoin price prediction. He shows that it does not hold for gold, and questions the selection bias that assumes it has held for bitcoin.

Eric Wall, the CIO of Arcane Assets, takes the critiques a step further, by listing the main arguments against the model made by analysts over the past year.

The New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has raised an additional $190 million for a bitcoin fund called NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP. TAKEAWAY: The raise is a hefty amount, especially when combined with the $140 million raised by the firm in May for its NYDIG Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund. Apparently the fresh raise was from 24 unnamed investors, which puts the average investment of each at around $8 million – this signals a strong institutional commitment.

Norwegian cryptocurrency investment firm Arcane Crypto is planning to go public through a reverse takeover of Swedish firm Vertical Ventures, which is listed on Nasdaq First North. Arcane will become the majority owners of Vertical Ventures, which will trade under the Arcane name. TAKEAWAY: Nasdaq First North is Nasdaq Nordic’s alternative stock exchange for smaller companies in Europe. While not exactly a large market, it is seen as a way to get some liquidity and market valuation experience, and as a stepping stone towards a listing on the main market. Meanwhile, we get more insight into crypto company financials.

A bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) managed by 21Shares, a Swiss-based product provider formerly known as Amun, has listed on Xetra, Deutsche Boerse’s electronic trading venue. TAKEAWAY: As with ETC Group’s bitcoin ETP last month, this will boost mainstream access to crypto investment. Xetra is one of the largest electronic trading platforms in Europe, and has a much more international reach than SIX Swiss Exchange and Boerse Stuttgart, the other exchanges on which 21Shares has listed crypto products.

A new docuseries called “Open Source Money” recently aired on July 4 and premiered on the Discovery Science channel. The new show gave millions of Discovery viewers information concerning bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, and blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency-focused show airing on Discovery will continue this summer with a number of episodes broadcasting once a week.

“Open Source Money” is the name of a new docuseries that aired on Saturday and premiered on the Discovery Science channel and the on-demand television provider Philo. The new series gives viewers insight into the cryptocurrency ecosystem by talking with a number of digital currency experts and luminaries like Brock Pierce and Charles Hoskinson.

The focus of the story is mainly about the Dragonchain (DRGN) initial coin offering (ICO) and how the project’s creators had to deal with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Dragonchain was also initially developed in 2014 at the Walt Disney Company branch in Seattle, but since 2016, the project and Disney severed relationships. The series “Open Source Money” was produced by the firm Vision Tree and the company raised $1 million via a variety of cryptocurrencies for filming.

The episodes feature Dragonchain’s issues with the SEC when the U.S. regulators deemed the project an “unlicensed security.” The episodes also feature the Chamber of Digital Commerce founder Perianne Boring, the notorious John McAfee, and Celsius Network’s Alex Mashinsky.

Reports say that Patrick Byrne will also star in one of the five parts filmed for the series. Despite the fact that the filmmakers follow the Dragonchain creators around for a bit, the first episode also acts as a Bitcoin 101 lesson.

The show’s theme also focuses on the current regulatory attitude toward cryptocurrencies in the United States. The show will air on Discovery Science and Philo at 10 a.m. ET every Saturday until the finale.

Discovery is an extremely popular channel with an 81 million U.S. network audience and six million in Canada. Outside the U.S., 2019 data shows that the Discovery network has well over 450 million viewers worldwide. Discovery Science is a subset of the official Discovery network of channels and can be found in most locations worldwide.

The San Francisco-based and Mark Cuban-backed on-demand streaming network, Philo has roughly 50,000 subscribers.

“Each episode highlights major contributors in the cryptocurrency revolution, including notable figures Patrick Byrne, Brock Pierce, Joe Roets, and companies the likes of Disney, Facebook, and more,” explains the “Open Source Money” website. The website’s welcome page adds:

Overall humanity is at a crossroads and the future of money as we know it will be transformed by Blockchain and the new internet of Value. The only question is, where will the US stand in the Space Race of our generation when the dust settles?

The website also notes that there’s a “provably fair 500,000 DRGN giveaway” and viewers need to find clues each week in order to win. According to the “Open Source Money” docuseries web portal, after each episode the clues can be used to find the elusive treasure.

This week’s question has a number of keywords and numbers that the viewer must choose in order to participate in the contest.

Words and numbers featured this week included: “1776, Pizza, Nascar, Cheesballs, Disney, Ramen, Beaxy, Hyundai, Seattle, or Avacodo Toast.” After each episode, a weekly prize winner will be selected,” explains the docuseries producers. “All correct answers, from the start of the contest, are entered into the Grand Prize drawing.”

The “Open Source Money” trailer can be seen below, while Philo and Discovery Science subscribers can watch from those channels.

The Nation of Cuba is dealing with a national food crisis, as Venezuela has stopped offering aid to the small island nation. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has caused a shortage of cash couriers called “mules” and everyday items are becoming scarcer. Amid the crisis, a number of Cubans are resorting to leveraging cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to curb inflationary pressure, and the country’s first peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Qbita launched last April.

The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the Cuban economy just like it has throughout the globe. However, Cuba has been hit much harder because of the country’s socialist regime. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean region and the state adheres to Communism and central planning. This gives the government an authoritarian position over the entire Cuban work force and the country’s means of production.

Leadership is quite tricky in Cuba, as Miguel Díaz-Canel is the President of the nation, but the people follow the rule of Raúl Castro’s guidelines. Raúl Castro is the official first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, and to this day, the first secretary is the most powerful leader in Cuba.

The country’s dealings with the coronavirus outbreak caused the island significant hardship and just recently, Venezuela has stopped offering the country assistance. The Venezuelan government used to be a lifeline for Cubans when it came to financial assistance.

The lack of help from Venezuela invoked the Communist Party to tell all Cuban residents to grow as much food as they can in order to survive. “Cuba can and must develop its program of municipal self-sustainability definitively and with urgency, in the face of the obsessive and tightened U.S. blockade and the food crisis COVID-19 will leave,” José Ramón Machado Ventura, deputy leader of the Cuban Communist Party, recently told the media.

In addition to the possible food crisis, Cubans have been seeing a shortage of “mules.” “Mules,” otherwise known as “Mulas,” are not delivering much-needed goods and cash to Cubans.

There’s an estimated 50,000 Cubans who consider themselves Mules, and they travel all around the world to bring cash and certain products. Mules account for close to half of the cash remittances in Cuba as well. Since Covid-19, however, Mules are now scarcer than the products and cash, as the outbreak has pretty much halted the Mule supply chain.

In order to curb the economic turmoil, a number of Cubans are resorting to bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. For instance, there are traders on the platform Localbitcoins stemming from Havana and Holguín.

A trader from San José de las Lajas sells bitcoin cash (BCH) with “no limits” for Western Union payments on the peer-to-peer exchange Local.Bitcoin.com. Further, a number of reports over the last two years show that a number of Cubans have been seeking out cryptocurrency solutions.

In September 2019, Reuters reported on Cuban residents “skirting U.S. sanctions by flocking to cryptocurrency, in order to shop online and send funds.” There is also a popular Telegram channel with thousands of Cubans called “Cubacripto,” where citizens gather to trade or discuss digital assets.

On April 23, 2020, Italian-Cuban entrepreneur, Mario Mazzola launched the country’s first peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) exchange qbita.org. Mazzola has detailed that Cubans find the platform Localbitcoin’s Know Your Customer (KYC) rules too strict, and Paxful geo-blocks citizens from Cuba. Last April, Mazzola discussed the qbita launch with Decrypt.co columnist Jose Antonio Lanz.

“I think that in the future we’re going to see fewer people coming to crypto just to make some easy money,” Mazzola explained during the interview. “We’re going to see more people using Bitcoin for its true purpose: the freedom to move money and to have total control of your funds.”

In addition to more actively managing their finances through the latest technology when compared to older generations, Millennials also appear to be more interested in alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and altcoin (alternative coins) investments are 3x more popular or common, as a long-term investment, among millennials as they are with other generations, according to a new survey.

This report appears to align with recent research published by the Financial Conduct Authority indicating there is growing interest in cryptoassets. The research by the FCA stated that 2.6 million UK consumers have purchased digital assets showing a dramatic 1.1 million increase since prior research completed by the FCA last year.

The survey, which was performed recently in the UK, received responses from affluent millennials. Approximately 20% of this demographic says they’ve made investments in crypto-assets.

This age group, which was born between 1981 and 1996, had at least £25,000 in investable assets – which is considerably more than the UK national average. Only 3% of UK citizens have £25,000+ in investable assets, meanwhile, 20% of millennials have the same amount to allocate towards short- to long-term investments.

It’s possible that younger people have invested in Bitcoin (BTC) because it has consistently been offering higher returns when compared to traditional stocks, with the exception of 2018 – which was one of the longest cryptocurrency bear markets.

During the past decade, the FTSE 100 (an index that represents the top 100 firms listed on the London Stock Exchange) has generated a significant 7.38% annualized rate of return. Annual returns rates have ranged from anywhere between -8.73% to +19.07% during this time period.

Bitcoin investors have only lost money on just 11% of the days during this period. They’ve remained profitable on 89% of the days.

As noted in an article contributed by Arsen Torosian, CEO at TAP.GLOBAL, the rates of return for Bitcoin investors over the years are as follows:

2011: +1,473%

2012: +186%

2013: +5,507%

2014: -58%

2015: +35%

2016: +125%

2017: +1,331%

2018: -72%

A recent study has revealed that a 5% allocation of Bitcoin (BTC), a 40% allocation to bonds and 60% to stocks may potentially double an investor’s returns over a four-year period (but always best to do your own research).

Nearly half of the people responding to a May 2020 survey said they “trusted” Bitcoin over big banks, which represents a 29% increase from 2017.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-is-the-most-important-trend-in-payments-says-visa-crypto-chief,"Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDC, may just be one of the most important trends over the next decade claims Visa’s head of crypto.

Cuy Sheffield, who runs credit card giant Visa’s crypto projects, tweeted that “as governments evaluate CBDC, the path they decide to take will have major implications for privacy, monetary sovereignty, geopolitics, and financial inclusion, as well as global adoption of crypto dollars and Bitcoin.” He said:

“I'd argue that central bank digital currency (CBDC) is one of the most important trends for the future of money and payments over the next decade. Regardless of anyone's personal views of whether it's good or bad, the reality is that global interest in it is not going away.”

Sheffield has been a proponent of CBDC for a while now. In May, Sheffield said central banks are not interested in consumer-facing digital currency solutions. Visa has not been shy about its interest in digital currencies. The company filed a digital currency patent application earlier this year.

Central banks have been experimenting with the idea of offering digital currencies themselves. The Bank of Japan announced it would test out the feasibility of a digital Yen to see if it can provide universal access and resilience to those who want to use the virtual currency. Japan is just one of a handful of countries looking at digital currencies. China could be coming out with a digital Yuan soon though no date has been revealed yet.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-neo-trx-xtz-vet,"Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio said that central banks have moved away from their traditional role and have become owners of assets since the 2008 Financial crisis. They now act as “market makers.” Therefore, the “capital markets are not free” anymore.

Dalio warned that the US dollar is likely to lose its attractiveness as the reserve currency of the world.

However, it will be a while before the current economic system crumbles due to the measures taken by the central banks. Until the majority do not realize that money printing cannot be the solution for every problem, institutional investment is only likely to slowly trickle into the crypto space.

The investments are likely to surge when the realization hits that the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies are flawed. That will boost crypto prices and result in a massive bull market.

BTC/USD

The relief rally in Bitcoin (BTC) could not rise above the 20-day exponential moving average ($9,234) on July 1 and 2, which is a negative sign as it shows that bears are aggressively defending this resistance level.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the bears now sink the top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap below the immediate support zone of $8,910.04-$8,825, a decline to $8,628 is possible. Such a move will indicate that the bears are selling at every available opportunity.

Below $8,628, the decline can extend to $8,130.58, which is likely to act as critical support. A strong bounce off this support could offer a buying opportunity to the traders. Conversely, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below $8,130.58, a new downtrend is likely to start.

Currently, the 20-day EMA is sloping down gradually and the relative strength index has been trading below 50 for the past few days, suggesting an advantage to the bears. A relief rally from the current levels is likely to face resistance at the 50-day simple moving average ($9,398).

A breakout of the downtrend line of the descending channel will be the first indication that the bulls are making a comeback.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

Both moving averages are sloping down on the 4-hour chart and the RSI has dipped below the 40 level, which suggests that bears have the upper hand in the short-term.

If the price dips to $8,910.04, this will be the fourth retest of this support level. Usually, when a support level is tested repeatedly, it tends to weaken. A strong break below this level could open up shorting opportunities to the traders.

However, if the pair rebounds off the $8,910.04 level, the bulls will try to push the price above the downtrend line of the channel. On a close (UTC time) above the channel, the short-term trend might shift in favor of the bulls with the first target objective of $9,800 followed by a retest of $10,058.52.

NEO/USD

The rebound off the critical $9.21399 support could not even touch the 20-day EMA ($10.23), which shows that the bulls are not in a hurry to buy NEO at higher levels as they are not confident that a bottom is in place.

NEO/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to the 40 level, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. They will once again attempt to sink the 21-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap below $9.21399.

If the bears succeed, a close (UTC time) below $9.21399 will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $5.25687. However, it is unlikely to be a straight fall to the target as the bulls will try to stall the decline at $7.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the price again rebounds off the $9.21399 support and rises above the 50-day SMA ($10.63).

NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is comfortably in the negative zone, which shows that bears have the upper hand. A break below $9.63407 will increase the possibility of a fall to $9.21399.

This is a critical level to watch out for because the bulls will try to defend it while the bears will want to break below it to start the downtrend.

If the bulls buy the dip and push the NEO/USD pair above $10.28183, the short-term bearish sentiment might be over.

However, if the bears can break and close (UTC time) below $9.21399, a new downtrend is likely. There is a minor support at $8.60349 and below that at $8.16228. But if both these supports are broken, a drop to $7 is possible.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle, which generally behaves as a continuation pattern. However, it is best to wait for the breakout to happen before initiating a trade because sometimes, the symmetrical triangle can also act as a reversal pattern.

TRX/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If the bulls can propel the 17th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap above the resistance line of the triangle, it will signal strength. The first target is $0.01864 and if this level is scaled, a rally to the pattern target of $0.0217882 is possible.

However, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages, it will signal weakness. In such a case, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely.

A break below the triangle can drag the price to $0.012 and if this support is also broken, the decline could extend to the pattern target at $0.0102118.

TRX/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The long wicks on the candles close to the 50-SMA (marked as ellipse on the chart) show that the bulls are aggressively attempting to defend this support.

If the bulls can carry the current bounce above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle, a rally to $0.0177451 and then to $0.01864 is possible.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears can sink the TRX/USD pair below the 50-SMA. If that happens, it is likely to attract further selling resulting in a drop to the support line of the triangle.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) bounced from close to the critical support of $2.2131 on June 27. But the bulls could not even carry the price to the 20-day EMA ($2.46), which shows a lack of demand at higher levels.

XTZ/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The 12th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has again dipped back to the $2.2131 support. If this support gives way, it is likely to attract further selling.

A close (UTC time) below the support will complete a double top pattern, which has a target objective of $1.2945.

The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, which indicates that bears have the upper hand.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the rebound off the current levels rises above the 20-day EMA.

XTZ/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the 50-SMA. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that bears have the upper hand.

If the bears can break below the critical support at $2.2131, a drop to $2.0581 and then to $1.80 is likely. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the XTZ/USD pair above the 50-SMA.

VET/USD

VeChain (VET) had been in a bottoming formation for over one and a half years. On July 4, the bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $0.011, suggesting the start of a new uptrend. The target objective of this breakout is $0.020.

VET/USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Currently, the 20th-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is facing selling at higher levels. Usually, a breakout from a long consolidation corrects and retests the breakout level but sometimes, if the momentum is strong, the pullback might be shallow.

In this case, the breakout level is $0.011 but it is not necessary that the price will drop to this level. The pullback is likely to find buyers at $0.01256 and below that at $0.011519, which are 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent leg of the up move.

The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the breakout level of $0.011.

VET/USD 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview

The recent leg of the up move had pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which indicated that the VET/USD pair had become overheated in the short-term.

Currently, the pair is in a pullback, which is likely to extend to the 20-EMA. A bounce off this support could resume the uptrend and this could offer an opportunity to ride the possible move higher.

Instead of chasing the price higher, it is a better strategy to wait for a pullback as that reduces the risk.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.coindesk.com/what-artists-love-about-crypto,"In this audio interview, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen and Blockade Games co-founder Marguerite deCourcelle talk about bitcoin’s impact on artistic careers. From collecting unique, interactive pieces to designing video games, Cuen and deCourcelle explore how crypto could redefine modern art.

Bitcoin is money but blockchain technology can also be used in a wide variety of art projects.

Perhaps the best known variety of blockchain-based visual art is non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

For example, Blockade Games co-founder Marguerite deCourcelle said her startup sold $160,000 worth of crypto assets, including NFTs, with most of the profits from two editions of the company’s first game, Neon District.

“Blockade has minted over 850,000 assets to blockchain game players,” deCourcelle said.

She broke onto the scene with paintings that included clues to hidden bitcoin prizes, then started creating interactive, digital art coupled with written roleplaying folklore.

“Instead of the idea of running through the digital treasure hunt and possibly getting bitcoin at the end, the design is now that you start at the beginning, there’s no barriers. You can just start playing,” she said, describing her video games. Players earn “tokens in the background and you’re notified once you’ve created something that’s unique.”

In short, the artist can now co-create with the audience in a way that scales individual experiences. Although DeCourcelle still paints, she’s become fascinated with the creative and artistic potential of blockchain technology.

Since the first wave of so-called decentralized applications (dapps) in 2017, non-fungible tokens have earned gamers more than $20 million through trading, and startups roughly $13.6 million for selling the digital assets, according to blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto. Most of that traction was in 2017, when the collectibles game CryptoKitties was the season’s hottest trend and briefly surged to more than 14,000 users.

Yet, Flipside Crypto CEO David Balter said observers should not dismiss blockchains such as Celo and the CryptoKitties creators’ upcoming Flow. Other gaming dapps like Gods Unchained and My Crypto Heroes garnered $4.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, selling digital assets.

“There are a number of chains that are working to establish dapps that are participants on the chain. Celo, for example, is doing a good job,” Balter said, listing the above-mentioned gaming projects as well. “We’re talking about customer acquisition costs and lifetime value…these are real businesses.”

Flipside Crypto data scientist Angela Minster added that most of these games so far see a surge during the first year, then struggle to retain users. In 2020, she expects to see improvement in that department.

In addition to niche gaming fans, investors’ interest in NFTs hasn’t wavered yet. The “Bitcoin Billionaire ” twins, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of the Gemini crypto, are also bullish on NFTs. They acquired the NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2019, which opened for business in March 2020 with digital pieces from artists including doodle-master Jon Burgerman and painter Kenny Scharf. A Nifty Gateway spokesperson said the platform has partnered with 16 brands and artists so far, with one Nifty selling for $10,500.

“Kenny Scharf sold out his collection [in] around two and a half minutes,” the spokeswoman added.

Driving value

Barely anybody uses crypto games these days and even Ethereum fans love to diss them, but some aficionados say a few startups show potential.

It’s a long shot, to be sure. Critics may argue these efforts are merely a small group of people trading software trinkets between friends. If so, that is also still true of the broader industry.

Balter estimated that by May 2020 roughly 2.13% of bitcoin wallets held 95% of bitcoin in circulation. This is still an industry with thousands of people holding most of the assets, betting broader demand from millions will drive value.

“This is actually the lowest concentration of [bitcoin] wealth since March 2016,” Balter said, as a crypto optimist himself. “Developer behavior rating is superb, over the past year the [diversity and contributions] rating has been trending up.”

According to a survey of 15,000 crypto fans by the startup Crypto.com, 73% of users believe cryptocurrency needs to be used as a currency to qualify for “mass adoption,” which 92% of respondents said could happen in the next five years. To some, this may seem as optimistic as betting on artistic crypto collectibles. Companies like Nifty Gateway are exploring how users might display them IRL, while video game creators like deCourcelle focus on interactive features.

Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today

The Ethereum's value has been evolving in recent times. The coin has been trading above the support zones of $205, moving well into the resistance levels of $230.

The coin has already found the support levels, which are critical to the coin surpassing resistance. Like any other crypto, failure to push through comes with some free fall, while getting past the resistance comes with even more rise.

Even though the prices are already high, the expected Ethereum 2.0 release will impact the value of the coin even further.

How Ethereum 2.0 Can Trigger the Ethereum Rally

Ethereum is at the moment trading at some of the highest levels. However, the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 is expected to boost the uptake of the coin to some unprecedented levels.

The launch slated for July would change the validation of transactions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

Instead of competing against each other, the validation will allow those with higher assets to take charge. Improved validation systems come with faster transaction speeds; thus, most people will be looking to use it.

Experts have been looking into the possible effects of a change in the validation, with most predicting an accompanying bull wave. For example, Adam Cochran, a partner at MetaCartel Ventures, believes the move is likely to create an Ethereum uptake wave.

Explaining in a tweet thread, he foresaw an increase like never before. The stream will then lead to a price shift.

Increase in Demand for Ethereum Affecting Prices

The other reason for a possible shift in the value of the Ethereum is the increased uptake. Most of the crypto investors are already monitoring the coins' position before the launch of ETH 2.0. They are looking to take up the currency due to its improved features.

The supply and demand of cryptos are similar to any other market. The more the need for the coin arises, the lesser the amount leading to higher prices.

Even though Ethereum already comes with assured returns on investments of around 3% to 5% per year, the increased demand seeks to improve the numbers further.

With most investors looking for guaranteed returns, the prospects of acquiring Ethereum will go hire, pushing its prices even more.

Ethereum also seeks to control the issuance, which would likely affect supply. At the moment, the issuance of Ethereum is capped at 4.3 million per year. However, after the ETH 2.0, Ethereum seeks to reduce the cap to 2 million in a year.

The reduction of supply with an increasing demand for top investors looking to gain the results is a positive catalyst for the price rallies.

The other reason for the possible bullish run of Ethereum is the fear of missing out by most clients. Most investors would not want to commit a similar mistake they did with Bitcoin. Some months in 2018 saw Bitcoin trade for as low as $1.

Fast forward to present when BTC is trading at $10,000, most investors feel that they might have lost an opportunity of a lifetime. It is not any other day that investment comes with a return 10, 000 times the investments. Most investors would be looking to become part of the new wave of Ethereum's price boost.

Other than the increased demand and reduced issuance caps, Ethereum also looks to control supply by burning of the base coin within regular intervals.

For a start, it seeks to burn around 10,000 ETH per year. Even though these seem ineligible compared to the millions of the ETH in supply, it will count for something in the long run.

With most coins held by the traders, eliminating even a slight portion would likely reduce the quantity, thus higher costs.

Increasing Use Cases of Ethereum to Bolster Supply

The main reason for the rollout of the Ethereum 2.0 is to help solve the current concerns in the blockchain system. Other than increasing the speeds of transactions through a change of validation, it also seeks to help alleviate the scalability concerns of Ethereum.

Ethereum 2.0 also seeks to improve accessibility. Unlike the current set up that favours mining companies with powerful machines for validation, the individuals mean that more people would likely become a party to the coin, thus improving demand.

Possible Challenges with the Ethereum Rally

Even though it might seem all rosy that the only remaining thing for a rise in the value of Ethereum is the release of ETH 2.0, there are a few concerns to look into. The first significant issue is the lack of trust in the new platform by existing traders.

Traders who are already making a killing on the existing model would not be so receptive to uncertainty.

Competition from the other existing cryptos is another concern. Already Bitcoin is established and looks not to relinquish its position as the world leader. Several other altcoins and Stable coins are also looking to join the frenzy.

It means ETH 2.0 must provide certain benefits to become the real market changer.

Bottom Line

After trading on some of the highest levels in recent times, Ethereum is ready to beat the resistance levels of $235. Such gains are likely to be bolstered even further with the release of Ethereum 2.0.

However, the changes by ETH 2.0 are not instant; the company has a multi-year rollout plan. With the coin release almost, traders should gear up to be part of one of the most exciting coin price shifts ever.

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Crypto Facilities, a subsidiary of Kraken, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Europe by euro trading volumes, has become the first cryptocurrency company to obtain a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

With this new license, Crypto Facilities will be able to expand its product range and better serve institutional clients who are mandated to trade on licensed platforms.

Additionally, it will be the only authorized derivatives marketplace in Europe offering leveraged trading of cryptocurrencies. Leveraged, cash-settled futures contracts offer a valuable tool for traders seeking exposure to bitcoin and other crypto assets without holding or accepting delivery of the product.

“We undergo these licensing efforts because Kraken is about making crypto accessible for everyone,” said Jesse Powell, CEO and Cofounder of Kraken. “This particular license means that a sophisticated class of investors, limited by their own requirements to interface with a regulated venue such as an MTF, will now have access to crypto derivatives in Europe for the first time. More participants means more liquidity and a better experience for everyone.”

“Crypto Facilities has pioneered cryptocurrency derivatives since 2015. We are proud to now become the first licensed cryptocurrency derivatives exchange outside of the US.” said Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities.

Google searches for ""bitcoin,"" the number of new Twitter followers of crypto exchanges, views of bitcoin's Wikipedia page, and bitcoin/USD trade volumes — are nowhere close to their 2017 figures when bitcoin hit a record high of $20,000 in mid-December.

Google searches for bitcoin, for instance, peaked during the week of December 17 2017. So far this year, people have searched for bitcoin eight times less as compared to the peak week.

Source: The Block Research, Google Trends

The number of new Twitter followers of crypto exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase, is also growing at a slower pace relative to the bull run of 2017. In January 2018, exchanges picked up on average 254,000 new Twitter followers per week, while the average addition in 2020 so far has been 5,340 per week—a 50X drop.

Similarly, Wikipedia views of the page ""bitcoin"" are 31 times lower than the peak week of December 3, 2017. As for BTC/USD trade volumes, it peaked during the week of December 17, 2017, at nearly $17 billion. While the average weekly trade volumes in 2020 year-to-date have been $2.5 billion — i.e., almost seven times lower than the peak period.

Overall, these metrics reveal that there are fewer market participants in the crypto market today as compared to December 2017. However, as The Block's Larry Cermak notes, the crypto space's market structure has matured drastically in the last two years and has become more institutionalized. It means when another rally takes place, the market will be much more ready.

More than 700,000 Expedia Group hotels and accommodations are now available via crypto-friendly travel booking platform Travala. Bookings can be paid with more than 30 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Despite covid-19, Travala saw a 170% increase in booking revenue from its 2 million properties in 230 countries.

Travel With Crypto via Expedia and Travala

Cryptocurrency-friendly travel booking platform Travala announced on Monday that more than 700,000 Expedia Group hotels and accommodations are now available on its website. Users can pay for their bookings with more than 30 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, in addition to traditional payments. This is possible due to a new partnership between Expedia Partner Solutions (EPS) and Travala.com.

Expedia launched EPS Rapid in 2018 to give travel companies access to its portfolio of over 700,000 properties with over 35 property types in more than 35,000 destinations worldwide. Travala.com was founded in 2017 and currently provides access to more than 2 million hotels and accommodations in 230 countries. Travala wrote:

Powered by EPS’s versatile API, Rapid, more than 700,000 Expedia Group hotels and accommodations are now available via Travala.com. On the site, travelers can book trips using more than 30 forms of cryptocurrency.

Among the cryptocurrencies accepted on Travala.com are BTC, BCH, ETH, BNB, and AVA, Travala’s native coin.

Expedia used to accept BTC on its own website. However, the company dropped the cryptocurrency payment option in June 2018.

Noting that “cryptocurrency adoption [is] on the rise,” Travala CEO Juan Otero said: “we want to ensure our users have payment choice and transparent pricing for every trip booked. EPS Rapid is the best API product in the travel industry and this partnership unlocks greater accommodation choice and availability for our users, including 4- and 5-star hotels in top destinations.”

On Saturday, Travala announced that AVA has been added to the Travelbybit point of sale (POS) system so it can now be used for purchases at over 500 merchants across Australia. Travala began offering Booking.com’s accommodation listings on its platform in November last year and merged with Travalbybit with backing from Binance in May.

In its June report, published on July 1, Travala revealed that its overall booking revenue for June was $184,296, an increase of over 170% from the previous month. Moreover, 59% of the total bookings were paid with cryptocurrencies in June, 21% of which were paid with bitcoin. Otero said Monday, “Our latest month-on-month data shows consumer confidence and the desire for travel is returning, with an 81% increase in room nights booked and website traffic up 50% week-on-week.”

Earlier it was reported that around 2 000 investors in Breedt’s defunct company, VaultAge Solutions (VS), stand to lose around R227 million after promises by Breedt to pay out their investments and growth were not honoured.

According to the news source, one of the biggest investors, who entrusted R7.5 million to Breedt, Simon Dix from Hilton, KwaZulu-Natal, successfully applied for a sequestration order against Breedt on Friday.

The Gauteng High Court in Pretoria granted the order to Dix.

In January this year, Breedt moved from Krugersdorp in Gauteng to the luxury Marina Martinique Estate in Aston Bay near Jeffreys Bay, sources familiar with the matter revealed.

They said that two weeks ago, he went into hiding after some irate investors, allegedly led by a colonel in the South African National Defence Force, called in the services of a group of “debt collectors” to find Breedt and recover their money from him.

Breedt opened a case of intimidation with police in Jeffreys Bay just before disappearing.

While awaiting the verdict of the sequestration application by Dix, investigators managed to track Breedt down at a guest house in the Silver Lakes Estate in Pretoria, according to News 24’s report.

Hiding his identity

Breedt reportedly booked into the guesthouse under the name of a friend, possibly to try and hide his identity.

Shortly after the order was granted to Dix, the sheriff of the court, assisted by the police, the Hawks and a team of specialist cryptocurrency forensic investigators, raided a house in Silver Lakes where Breedt had allegedly been hiding since mid-June.

They served the court order on him while he was with a medical doctor friend who also resides in Silver Lakes, according to the news report.

During the raid, numerous electronic devices, among others a laptop and nano stick, were confiscated.

The nano stick is a secure storage device which might contain information of where the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Breedt traded might be.

Cryptocurrency is usually kept in a crypto wallet, to which only the owner has access.

The group of investors were earlier also granted a court order to freeze two South African bank accounts belonging to Breedt and VS.

Despite rumours that Breedt was arrested on Friday, News 24 confirmed that this was not true.

In the meantime, the South African Reserve Bank has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to launch an investigation into VS and all agents who were involved in selling cryptocurrency on behalf of the company, the report said.",2020-07-06 10:21:08+00:00,,,,,,

Wrapped Bitcoin, the oldest tokenized bitcoin protocol on Ethereum, is responsible for roughly 75% of that growth after moving more than 4,800 BTC to Ethereum last month.

Demand has increased for using bitcoin in a variety of decentralized financial services as Ethereum continues to be the most popular off-chain destination for bitcoins. More specifically, yield farming and MakerDAO adding tokenized bitcoin as collateral are likely strong catalysts, said Medio Demarco, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital.

“The recent trend shouldn’t come as a surprise and will probably continue,” Demarco told CoinDesk.

The increasing popularity of tokenized bitcoin is also no surprise to Ben Chan, CTO at BitGo, the cryptocurrency payments processor that spearheaded Wrapped Bitcoin. “The purpose of WBTC is to bring bitcoin to the world of decentralized finance,” Chan said. “Yield opportunities for lending and supplying WBTC” in Ethereum-based applications are driving recent growth, he added.

Currently $132 million worth of bitcoin is on Ethereum, at the time of publication, or roughly 0.08% of the leading cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, according to OnChainFX.

Is the growing demand to use bitcoin on Ethereum a positive signal for the leading cryptocurrency? According to Demarco, the trend has a “synergistic” effect for both blockchains.

Chan agreed, telling CoinDesk that, for Ethereum, growth in the value of assets on decentralized finance applications is “a step towards the maturation of trustless and transparent financial services.” For Bitcoin, the benefit comes from being able to earn yield and collateralize bitcoin,” which “adds incentive” for users to invest in the cryptocurrency, according to Chan.",2020-07-07 20:19:42+00:00,https://techbullion.com/will-bitcoin-ever-become-stable/,"Overall, 2019 was a good year for Bitcoin prices. While the cryptocurrency started the year slowly with low value, it finished it off great and entered the new decade with a bang. As you’d imagine, the recent Coronavirus outbreak negatively affected the price of Bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency suffered the biggest price drop in 7 years due to the outbreak. As Coin Desk reports, the price plummeted 26% in just one day. The market cap went from $147 billion down to a mere $107 billion during that time. Since then, it went down even further, which caused a lot of concern.

Is this a make-or-break time for Bitcoin? Not really. You can’t judge the success of a cryptocurrency by its current price. We judge it by completely different standards. Today, we’re going to see what volatility means for Bitcoin and see whether it can ever become stable or not.

How Stable is Bitcoin Today?

Bitcoin’s all-time volatility is around 3.5%, which may not sound like a lot at a first glance. However, when you dig a little deeper, you realize that compared to other currencies and assets. Most currencies in the world have volatility between 0.5% and 1%, while silver and gold have a volatility of around 1%.

As we mentioned in the opening paragraph, the current crisis is making Bitcoin fluctuate up and down in price on a daily basis. Bad news and big events like the one we’re experiencing now hurt Bitcoin’s price. However, you probably already knew that if you ever dabbled in cryptocurrency.

Even smaller, headline-grabbing events have negatively affected the price of Bitcoin. Back in 2014, for example, Mt. Gox bankruptcy shocked and scared away several early Bitcoin supporters and investors. They backed off further investments and the price of Bitcoin plunged.

Are things going to become better by the end of the year? There are many perspectives on the future of the crypto market. While most experts agree that the price of Bitcoin won’t go significantly down this year, people can’t seem to agree will it be worth $5,000, $10,000 or $100,000 by the end of the year.

Why is Bitcoin So Volatile?

Big news stories and large, history-altering events affect many things, so, surprisingly, they would have an effect on Bitcoin’s price. However, that’s not the only reason why Bitcoin is so volatile. Let’s look at a few factors that have a large influence on Bitcoin’s volatility.

1. Market Manipulation

While many people like to ignore this, the fact is, price manipulation happens often in the world of crypto. There’s clear evidence of Bitcoin price manipulation happening in 2013 and again in 2017. It’s clear that this sort of manipulation contributes to Bitcoin’s volatility.

2. Tax Treatment

The IRS simply doesn’t treat Bitcoin – or any other cryptocurrency, for that matter – as an accrual currency. Instead, they treat it as an asset for tax purposes. While the recognition of cryptocurrencies had a positive impact on Bitcoin volatility, but the decision to treat it as an asset didn’t.

3. Lack of Investors

While many people are investing in Bitcoin, most are afraid to try it out. At the moment, Bitcoin has a market cap of $94.7 billion. That number can go down significantly if the virus outbreak isn’t contained and the state of emergency continues for a few more months. And that makes people afraid to invest.

4. Buying on Credit

Many people look at Bitcoin as an investment. At one point, nearly 20% of Bitcoin purchases were made on credit. However, banks and lenders no longer there to help people. Most banks no longer allow their clients to purchase Bitcoin with credit cards.

Those are not the only reasons. There are dozens and dozens more, but those are the biggest and the ones worth talking about the most.

Can Bitcoin Become Stable?

What would make Bitcoin stable? Widespread use would definitely bring more stability to the crypto world. You have to remember that the technology is still in its infancy and the mainstream public still isn’t aware of what can you do with crypto. But new tech advancements are making things better.

The average person can start using Bitcoin to make purchases and investments in a matter of minutes. Platforms like NordikCoin enable users to set up an account, purchase Bitcoins, and start using them with just a few clicks. By creating an account, you can mine for Bitcoin, trade it, or keep it in your wallet.

Cryptocurrencies have also gone global. Bitcoin is becoming more and more accepted over the world, especially in third-world countries, where traditional financial systems have seemingly failed. In Latin America and Africa, for instance, Bitcoin has become more popular than ever in recent years.

In these countries, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have the biggest opportunity to enter the mainstream, become widely used, and gain liquidity. Bitcoin will see less price fluctuation if it manages to gain more liquidity in the next few years. Will this be achievable in the long run? It’s hard to say.

Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Stability

You should keep in mind that Bitcoin isn’t the only currency that experienced a price drop due to the recent events. Countries around the globe are struggling to protect their currencies. Last week, the US government artificially pumped up more than $1 trillion in the economy to prevent it from collapsing.

In turn, this kept the value of a dollar steady until the situation with the Coronavirus isn’t solved. The price of Bitcoin is back at around $5,400. People expect it to stay hovering around that price. Even if the price goes down, this is nothing for Bitcoin.

Whatever happens to the price of Bitcoin, no one can artificially boost it. The price of Bitcoin is only supported by its demand. In this strange case, Bitcoin’s volatility is what makes it consistent.

The seven-day moving average of the number of active ether addresses rose to 405,014 on Friday – a threshold not seen since May 2018, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.

Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that are active in the network either as a sender or receiver. Glassnode takes into account only those addresses that were active in successful transactions.

As of Monday, the seven-day average was down slightly to 390,162. That’s still 115% growth from the low of 180,750 seen on Jan. 30.

The increased ether activity could be associated with the explosive growth of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, as well as the number of daily tether (USDT) transactions on the network.

At press time, about 3.1 million ether were locked in various DeFi applications, according to data source defipulse.com. Meanwhile, the number of daily USDT – the most used stablecoin – transactions on ether has increased by over 400% this year, as per CoinMetrics.

The heightened demand for ether from such use cases is expected by many to fuel a major bull run. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has struggled to decouple from bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.

Daily chart: ETH/USD and BTC/USD Source: TradingView

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is moving pretty much in tandem with bitcoin. The ether-bitcoin one-year correlation has risen to 89%, the highest on record, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Some observers would argue that address growth is not a reliable indicator of adoption, as a single user can own multiple addresses. Crypto exchanges also store coins belonging to traders in multiple addresses.

While that’s true, ether’s active addresses metric is more reliable compared to that of bitcoin. “Active addresses are inflated on bitcoin because of the UTXO model,” tweeted to Anthony Sassano, SetProtocol product marketing manager and co-founder of EthHub, an open-source initiative founded by the Ethereum community.

UTXO stands for unspent transaction output. Under the UTXO model, bitcoin users have to use new addresses with each transaction. Meanwhile, Ethereum uses an accounts model, under which addresses get reused, as noted by Sassano.

Bitcoin’s daily active addresses recently rose to the highest level since December 2017, suggesting scope for a price rally to $12,000, according to Bloomberg analysts.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,270, representing a 0.8% drop on the day and ether is trading at $238, down 1.7%, according to CoinDesk data.

Ether jumped 6% on Monday to print its biggest single-day gain since June 22. However, a trendline falling from June 2 and June 24 highs is still intact.

If network activity is a guide, the cryptocurrency could soon breach the trendline resistance, currently at $246. That would signal a continuation of the rally from March lows below $100 and expose $289 (Feb. 15 high).",2020-07-07 12:15:46+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/zoomers-push-dogecoin-up-20-viral-tiktok-pump/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Dogecoin is going viral as teens pump the cryptocurrency on TikTok. The #DogecoinTikTokChallenge started after TikTok user, jamezg97, posted a video intending to pump Dogecoin to $1. Within five days the video amassed half a million views:

“Let’s all get rich! Dogecoin is practically worthless. There are 800 million TikTok users once it hits 1 dollar, you’ll have $10,000. Tell everyone you know.”

Another video by user kindashortidiot says:

“Everybody, just please listen to me. This is Dogecoin. If you know nothing about investing, it doesn’t really matter. Go put $25 into this and that will be 10,000, okay? And if this reaches $1, you will have made ten grand. Please, just try it out. Go pump it!”

DOGE is currently trading at a fraction of a penny, or $0.002777 to be precise. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency is up 15% in the last 24 hours.

For the coin to hit the touted $1 mark, it has to gain 440-times its current price. Given that Dogecoin annually adds over 5 billion coins to its circulating supply, the odds of hitting $1 are next to impossible.

Historically, Dogecoin hit an all-time high of $0.0175 on Jan. 7, 2018, during the froth of the crypto bull market. Since then, prices have fallen dramatically, with the token trading in a range between two-tenths and three-tenths of a cent.

Wintermute, a London-based market maker in the digital asset space, announced Tuesday the close of the multi-million dollar raise exclusively to The Block, noting that the fresh capital injection will help it continue to provide liquidity in new markets and products across the non-custodial and centralized cryptocurrency exchange space. Wintermute raised a ""seven-figure"" sum in a seed round in February, as The Block previously reported.

Lightspeed, which is the only investor in the round, was founded in 2000. The firm has previously invested in Blockchain.com and Ripple. Partner Jeremy Liew is known for being Snapchat's first investor. Earlier this year, it raised more than $4 billion across three funds.

Wintermute has stood out among other trading firms in the crypto space as a first-mover in providing liquidity to nascent, esoteric markets and serving as a partner on the launches of products including decentralized exchange dYdX's perpetual swaps and Amun's leverage tokens.

""We are quite profitable from our core activities,"" said Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy, a former derivatives trader at European high-frequency trading firm Optiver. ""We want to continue to grow by being competitive in new products.""

Gaevoy added that the impetus to raise capital was the COVID-19 health and economic crisis, which first gripped global markets at the beginning of this year. The point was to raise cash in case the firm needed it to weather the storm, but given favorable market conditions for market makers it will now allow the firm to accelerate its plans. Gaevoy said options are the next thing on the firm's radar and it is also eyeing the launch of its own over-the-counter trading desk to compliment its market making business.

Already, the firm says it is one of the largest liquidity providers across spot and perpetual swap markets, ""covering 500 pairs across most vetted crypto exchanges and trading platforms.""

The firm is a liquidity provider on London-based Blockchain.com's exchange. CEO Peter Smith told The Block the trading firm came on as a liquidity provider following launch, adding that they offered superior product scalability and stability relative to competitors. To be sure, Blockchain is an investor in the firm and they are a primary market maker for some pairs on the exchange, according to Smith.

More exchanges, more money

Looking to the future, further fragmentation in the crypto exchange landscape could serve as a tailwind for market makers like Wintermute.

""The growing number of crypto exchanges is leading to an increased need for market making, and that is where Wintermute comes in,” said Liew. In a conversation with The Block by phone, Liew added that the patchwork of regulatory regimes across the crypto world would likely lead to new exchanges popping up to serve specific regional jurisdictions, fueling the need for market makers to provide liquidity on day one and beyond.

Although centralized exchange volumes have fallen off a bit, non-custodial volumes continue to hit new highs and firms continue to launch new products.

""With the rise of DeFi and decentralized exchanges, the rise in the real number of exchanges, we saw the opportunity for market makers,"" he said.

Indeed, Zhuoxun Yin, previously head of strategy of dYdX, said that lining up market makers like Wintermute is one of the most important things an exchange needs to do prior to launching a new market or product.

""It is very hard to get traders onto an exchange or into a product very early on,"" he said. ""There is price and product risk.""",,https://www.coindesk.com/chainalysis-ribbit-capital-sound-ventures-government-ties,"Disclosure

“Such low volatility is uncharacteristic of bitcoin,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “However, this sentiment has permeated through the trading community.”

Less volatility has translated into fewer options bets. Open interest has dropped since the June 26 expiration date and is now hovering at the $1.1 billion mark. That’s quite a bit off from where it was in June, when it hit a record $1.8 billion high, according to derivatives data aggregator Skew.

The lack of action is causing vigilant traders to change their strategies. For example, there appears to be sentiment that bitcoin at $9,000 is a good price point for traders to buy. “Every time the market has poked its nose below $9,000, buyers have stepped in,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at London-based broker Koine.

Indeed, over the past month, when the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dipped below $9,000, traders scooped it up on spot markets like Coinbase.

Douglas says the narrow bitcoin price action might not last because most traders surely would like more volatility, which is what attracts many to crypto in the first place. “Bitcoin is coiled for a big move,” he told CoinDesk. “I still favor the upside. I think we will see bitcoin heading above $11,000 in short order when a move comes.”

Cryptocurrency market prices have improved a great deal since our last market update, as the overall market capitalization of all 5,700+ coins has gained $16 billion since June 14. Most of the top digital assets have remained in a consolidated cycle and a great number of cryptos have been able to hold above their 50-day averages.

Crypto Market Capitalization Inches Toward $300 Billion

The crypto community is curious about what’s going to happen next in the land of digital currency markets. Today, on Wednesday, July 8, a great number of coins are up in value and have gathered decent gains. At the time of publication, the entire crypto cap of all the coins in existence is around $277 billion and there’s roughly $21.6 billion in global trades. Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $9,342 per coin and has a $172 billion market valuation. As far as seven-day gains are concerned BTC is only up 1% for the week.

The second-largest cap on Wednesday is Ethereum (ETH), which is trading for $245 per ETH at the time of publication. ETH has gained 7% during the last seven days. The stablecoin tether (USDT) currently holds the third-largest market valuation and it seems it will hold there for quite some time. Currently, the USDT market cap us around $9.6 billion and there’s $7 billion in global USDT trades today. XRP is the fourth largest valuation today, as each XRP is swapping for $0.19 per coin. XRP has gained 13% during the last seven days and it’s up over 8% today.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the fifth-largest market cap on Wednesday, with a valuation of around $4.4 billion at press time. Each BCH is swapping for $242 per coin and there’s $372 million in global BCH trades. Over the last 24 hours BCH has gained 2% and during the last seven days prices jumped over 8%. The top pair with bitcoin cash today is tether (USDT) with 58% of BCH trades being swapped for USDT. This is followed by BTC (26.27%), KRW (4.31%), USD (3.87%), GBP (1.95%), and ETH pairs (1.15%).

Digital Currency Market Analyst: ‘More Capital Inflows Are Needed’

This week a number of economists and analysts have been trying to predict what will drive the next cryptocurrency bull run. Etoro market analyst, Simon Peters, thinks that more institutional investment is needed to prime the bull.

“So what is going to drive the next bull run in bitcoin?” Peters asked in a weekly investor’s note. “In my view, it is institutional investment. Bitcoin is the most well-known and biggest crypto by market cap and its development to date has mainly been dominated by retail investors. As word has spread, in particular since the price boom of 2017 and 2018 where prices hit all-time highs of $20,000, we have begun to see more institutional interest. This has taken the form of institutional investors buying the underlying crypto asset and indirect investment such as buying shares in bitcoin trust companies or investing in ETPs (Exchange Traded Products).” Peters continued by adding:

If we are going to see bitcoin prices rise sustainably above the $10,000 psychological barrier and even as high as $30k or $40k, then more capital inflows are needed, which will most likely have to come from institutions. Glassnode recently shared an interesting stat, showing that 61% of bitcoin in circulation hasn’t been touched in over a year. That’s an all-time high for this metric. In fact, the last time we witnessed such inactivity was just before the great bitcoin bull run of 2017. An omen of things to come, perhaps?

A Possible 1929-like Economic Crash Might be Looming on the Horizon

The cryptocurrency community recently witnessed the significant drop in value on March 12, 2020, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday.’ Unfortunately, another leg-down could happen again, and the popular economist A. Gary Shilling believes it will be much like 1929’s economic crash. Shilling is specifically talking about traditional commodities, stocks, and equities, as he thinks the pandemic is the “most disruptive financial and social event since World War II.” Some bitcoin speculators think that there is a strong correlation between digital currency markets and the performance of traditional equity markets.

“Stocks are [behaving] very much like that rebound in 1929 where there is absolute conviction that the virus will be under control and that massive monetary and fiscal stimuli will reinvigorate the economy,” Shilling said in his recent interview.

Even though stock markets have seen some gains in the U.S. and in China, Citi strategist Robert Buckland agrees with Shilling’s sentiment. Buckland explained to the press that institutional and retail investors should wait until prices sink lower in order to enter new positions.

Cardano Jumps 85% in Ten Days Time

Lastly, during the last two weeks, the price of cardano (ADA) jumped from a low of $0.07 per ADA to $0.129 per coin. ADA is up 25% today and is the forerunner out of the top ten coins that rests right behind the BCH market position. Just recently, ADA founder Charles Hoskinson recently talked about a possibility of cross-chain interoperability with Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

On the first of July, the Cardano development team deployed a Shelley upgrade node onto the network. The complete Shelley upgrade (hard fork) will take place on July 29. ADA did touch a high of 85% worth of weekly gains, but seven-day stats currently show the price has leveled, as ADA is up 52% for the week at $0.129 per ADA.

This Week’s Gainers and Losers

Overall it’s been a decent week for cryptocurrency investors and the top ten gainers this week includes dogecoin, vechain, constellation, cardano, acute angle cloud, sia coin, echolink, hdac, game, and ultrain. The top ten losers this week are coins like cosmochain, the SLP-based token spice, multi-collateral DAI, fanstime, egretia, fantom, nimiq, origin trail, energi, and digitex futures.

That question gets tougher to answer every day as new digital assets join the thousands already traded. Those looking to figure out which ones are the most important have often used simple metrics such as market capitalization to sort through the Lego pile of coins and tokens. Such simplistic filtering tells only part of the story and is fraught with the potential for manipulation. (Read Anna Baydakova’a recent article for a salient illustration.)

That’s why CoinDesk has launched the CoinDesk 20. This group of 20 digital assets makes up most of what people mean when they say “the cryptocurrency market.” But volume is not the sole criterion for inclusion.

Returns of the CoinDesk 20 for 2020 Q2. Source: Nomics

While these 20 cryptocurrencies, tokens and stablecoins together are worth more than 90% of the entirety of the crypto market, the list is not derived simply from valuations. Rather, it involves a smarter way to find the assets most relevant to the market.

A more sophisticated methodology

It starts with the exchanges. But not every exchange – far from it.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

On the wild frontier of crypto trading, hundreds of exchanges pop up all the time. Few are trustworthy and reliable. Only a sliver have done what they can to remove manipulation.

CoinDesk’s research team analyzed several studies on the veracity of trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges. The team settled on reports from three different outfits – Bitwise, The Block and Digital Asset Research – as the ones deemed to have the soundest research. Of the dozens of venues the reports analyzed, only eight exchanges appeared on all three. Those eight are Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex.

Notably absent from the list are Huobi, OKEx and Binance, the last perhaps the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. That’s because each of them is absent from at least one of the above lists. To be sure, each of those exchanges offers traders price discovery on some key markets. However, in some of the reports the researchers found sufficient cases of questionable volume on those exchanges to raise some doubt about their reliability. Their exclusion from the CoinDesk 20 may be revisited in the future.

From the group of eight exchanges, CoinDesk added up the volume on every asset traded by quarter, using data provided by Nomics. Any cryptocurrency or digital asset that doesn’t trade on at least two of the eight exchanges didn’t qualify for the CoinDesk 20 because having an asset trade on more than one exchange enables arbitrage opportunities should prices move too far out of whack from one venue to another. That ensures the price and volume data reflect the true market. We then ranked the cryptocurrencies by volume over the last two consecutive quarters. Performing the ranking over two quarters filters out any asset that would have, say, one active month but otherwise show no sustained trading volume. Using the same model, CoinDesk will re-run this analysis every quarter and update the list accordingly.

The CoinDesk 20's new dashboard distills information on the 20 digital assets moving the market.

It should be noted Bitwise no longer includes Bitfinex’s prices in how it calculates its index values, a separate operation from its “real volume” calculations. It’s the latter that matters in the methodology for selecting the CoinDesk 20.

Bitwise continues to include Bitfinex in the exchanges contributing to that measure of volume, the data for which continues to be updated and published. Bitwise removed Bitfinex from its index pricing sources in 2019 after the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the exchange. It did so due to concerns about prices deviating in the future should anything happen in the legal case. However, in an email Wednesday, Bitwise’s head of research told CoinDesk, “We still very much believe that Bitfinex has real volume.”

No doubt, over time some newcomers will join this list and existing assets will drop off it. For now, though, these are the results of a clear, objective approach using reliable data.

The Bitwise real volume report of March 2019 also notes that Bitfinex used market surveillance tools to “help detect market manipulations, such as spoofing and wash trading through the real-time and historical analysis of trades, order books and other market information.” This set it apart from some other exchanges Bitwise surveyed, including Binance. So did the fact that Bitfinex registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

As it turns out, the 20 assets making up the first quarterly construction of this filtered list comprise 99% of all the trading volume on the eight exchanges. What’s more, as of June 17, the current CoinDesk 20 represented $239.38 billion in market cap, according to data compiled by Messari. The remaining 5,145 cryptocurrencies were worth $25.85 billion. That makes the CoinDesk 20 representative of 90.3% of the entire cryptosphere’s market cap.

By the same token, the CoinDesk 20 is not a ranking of the relative worth or importance of each crypto or blockchain project. It is not a judgment on the quality of the technology or the caliber of the team developing it. No doubt some readers will have strong opinions on why this or that asset should be in the CoinDesk 20 and why others shouldn’t be. No doubt, over time some newcomers will join this list and existing assets will drop off it. For now, though, these are the results of a clear, objective approach using reliable data.

The revamped CoinDesk 20 pages feature chart data, key metrics, news, videos and educational content on the workings of the underlying technology.

Likewise, compiling the best data in crypto often requires trade-offs. Such is the case when viewing tether (USDT) on the CoinDesk 20 asset page. As we go live, the market cap shown for the stablecoin is roughly $6 billion. Yet, this is only the value of the token as found on the Ethereum blockchain. In fact, tether also operates on the Omni, Tron, EOS, Liquid, Algorand, and SLP networks. Those are valued at an additional $4.9 billion, and CoinDesk is working on a way to incorporate accurate and timely figures for these other blockchains into the total number.

More data

CoinDesk is doing more than just making a list of assets, however. In addition, investors, traders and researchers are provided with a deep dive into the data they need to make educated decisions about these 20 digital assets.

Each individual asset page contains information about the type of currency, its returns, volume, volatility, transactions, fees, value proposition and consensus mechanism, to name just a few of the data points. This will give anyone researching the asset a clearer sense of how it relates to others and to other asset classes.

The CoinDesk 20 assets make up 99% of crypto market trading volume.

The CoinDesk 20 is a new tool for analyzing a new space. We look forward to evolving it – carefully and gradually – as the field of digital assets progresses. We’ll certainly tweak the data we ingest and alter how we present it on our asset pages. We may even revisit the methodology based on new perspectives and reader feedback. We invite you to share yours.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading around $9,300 at press time, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

While bitcoin has yet to restore the immediate bullish trend and is trading 50% below its record high of $20,000, gold has jumped to a nine-year high of $1,801 per ounce, as per data source TradingView.

The hedge asset now sits just 6% short of the lifetime high of $1,920 reached in September 2011.

The precious metal is likely drawing bids due to negative real (inflation-adjusted) yields offered by the US bonds, as noted by popular macro analyst Holger Holger Zschaepitz.

Comparison of gold and U.S. 10-year real yield (inverse) Source: Bloomberg

As seen above, the real yield has declined from 0.3% to -0.73% over the past 3.5 months. During the same period, gold has rallied from $1,450 to $1,800. Essentially, gold is performing as an inflation hedge.

Bitcoin also rallied from $3,867 to $10,400 in the two months leading up to its third reward halving on May 11. Since then, however, the rally has stalled and the cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to find a foothold above $10,000. More importantly, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index has strengthened, denting its appeal as a safe-haven asset.

Tip of the iceberg

Many analysts, however, remain optimistic about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

“In the BTC market, there is an increased institutional acceptance and awareness of the asset class which should bode well for long-term price appreciation. We’ve seen prominent organizations and figures such as [Paul Tudor Jones], JPMorgan, Fidelity, which are publicly involved in the market, yet this is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Stephen Stonberg, COO and CFO at Bittrex Global, a cryptocurrency exchange.

Legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones allocated 1%-3% of his investment portfolio to bitcoin futures in May.

”Bitcoin volatility has been lower than that of traditional assets throughout this crisis; however, we would argue there is nothing traditional about equity markets and the traditional economy today,” Stongberg added. “In this ‘new normal,’ bitcoin starts to look appealing as a new asset class that is not subject to the constraints and money printing of central banks.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet by more than $3 trillion since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in early March. However, the unprecedented money printing and the resulting concerns over inflation have mainly benefited gold. It remains to be seen if bitcoin takes up its expected role as an inflation hedge in the long run.

As for the next 24 hours or so, the focus is on the trendline resistance around $9,330. A strong move above that level would open the doors for $10,000. Alternatively, a move below the weekend low of $8,900 may invite stronger chart-driven selling.",2020-07-08 12:59:15+00:00,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-cfds-defi-moves-blockchain-deals-more-n-7059.htm,"Source: Adobe/promesaartstudio

When it comes to BTC's next move, volatility contraction often comes before expansion, which eventually leads to a breakout or breakdown, said Binance in their June trading report. The reduced volatility could be connected with increased hodling, given that traders do not feel incentivized to sell BTC. The team noted that they observed open interest growth in June, which might suggest that traders are positioned for a big move. Furthermore, ""recent price action looks promising,"" but bitcoin needs ""considerable volume to breakthrough and if successful, this will be a good indication of positive confidence going into the rest of this week,"" they said.

All rights reserved.",,https://www.itproportal.com/features/cryptocurrency-as-an-alternative-during-times-of-inflation/,"We have seen investors and consumers alike deliberate about what the economy will look like post-pandemic. As the world emerges from the crisis, industries that have been shut down will be left surveying the widespread damage, some of it permanent. Consumers will likely be split between the fortunate ones that have been able to work and others whose livelihoods have been compromised as a result of the shutdown.

To mitigate the sever economic impact, governments and central banks globally are printing and distributing extra money to prop up parts of the economy which can no longer function at pre-Covid capacity levels. In the UK alone, an estimated £123bn has already been plugged into the economy and there are estimates that Bank of England stimulus levels could peak at £1 trillion.

Despite the argued necessity of these measures, it is almost impossible not to question the impact on inflation. This massive increase in governmental quantitative easing will have an impact on the global economy, and for asset prices in particular. While inflation is defined as the rate at which the average price level that particular goods and services increase over a period of time, it’s easier in this context to regard it as the result of a decrease in purchasing power.

The golden option

As a result, investors will often look safe-haven assets that could provide a hedge against rising prices and avoid the destructive impact of inflation. Gold price is one indicator, and at the time of writing it is seeing a ten-year high while London’s FTSE 100 tumbled 2.8 per cent, and the Eurex Exchange reported a 59 per cent month-on-month decline since April volume. Historically gold had been used as a hedge to protect against economic events including inflation or currency devaluation. Although we can expect this use to continue as a popular option, the pandemic has shown a shift in consumer interest to other safe haven asset classes.

Cryptocurrency is an alternative method of inflation protection which should not be overlooked. Although previously appearing as counterintuitive due to perceived volatility, digital assets have held their own against the stock market, unlike other commodities such as oil. The value of oil has crashed due to vanishing demand and a resulting supply excess – causing the price to fall to negative value.

While the comparison between gold and crypto has some nuances – the broader theme of Bitcoin as a protective hedge against inflation has broken through – especially after the BTC halving we saw in early May. This event has brought attention to Bitcoin’s controlled supply, with only 21 million max tokens being permitted. At a time when more paper currency is being created in circulation, the amount of Bitcoin halving is causing investors to look away from government-backed paper. While also highlighting the use of cryptocurrency generally as a means of exchange within a more digitally oriented world economy.

A newer alternative: The Crypto offering

In contrast, digital assets have seen a different story. Without the worry of political interference and variable supply rates, cryptocurrencies can benefit from being a less vulnerable investment in times of crisis. We have seen that Bitcoin is still up 22 per cent from a year ago. Newer coins like Tezos are up around 30 per cent so far this year. Both digital currencies highlight that crypto volatility is potentially a sign of the past, especially when compared to the volatility in “traditional” asset markets.

With crypto trading operating 24/7, 365 days a year with instantaneous settlement while traditional equities still have fixed trading hours and have a settlement cycle of T+3, crypto can provide even more perceived security and flexibility for investors. Cryptocurrencies can also be used as a tool for portfolio diversification and as a method of protection against the economic and political uncertainties to come.

Looking at the examples

We have witnessed economic disruption before, across ongoing periods of hyperinflation in Venezuela and Zimbabwe more recently, and in Weimar Germany in the 1920s. While it is not helpful to draw comparisons across these countries’ or their respective banking systems, it is worth taking note of the value crypto offers in terms of being an alternative to unstable national currencies.

Well-known investors such as Paul Tudor Jones are buying bitcoin, saying that his fund may hold as much as a low single-digit percentage of assets in bitcoin futures – a measure to protect against a rise in inflation. While Mike Novogratz stated that 2020 “will and needs to be Bitcoin’s year,” underlining further investor confidence in digital currencies. Data reinforces this view, by looking at results from the crypto asset manager Grayscale. In Q1, inflows north of $500 million, more than doubling its previous best quarter. Almost a third of this capital came from new investors and most being institutions. Almost every indication that inflationary fears shall add to the tailwinds already powering fresh investment in cryptocurrency, among them institutional involvement and improving regulation.

Bitcoin is inherently structured to encourage a deflationary approach and a relatively stable store of value – acting as a true alternative to hedge against inflation, as well as the policies that precede it.

Some concluding remarks

While digital assets emerged out of the embers of the 2008 financial crisis, we can only speculate what technological innovations will rise post-pandemic. Hopefully, the global economy will allow cryptocurrencies to solidify their place in future investment portfolios as it currently demonstrates strong performance and price sustainability.

We are beginning to see the early signs are already there, that investors are turning to cryptocurrencies both as a key tool for diversification and a hedge against uncertainties to come. Ultimately, we are just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to truly understanding the vast opportunities that digital assets and blockchain for transforming the global economy and we are ready for this challenge.

A Malaysian court has fined famous local actor Mas Khan $4,000, or 26 months in jail, for stealing around $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency belonging to his producer, local media reported.

Khan appears to have gained access to his boss’ Datuk A.Aida private keys before plundering his wallet on two separate occasions, the same day.

In the first case, Khan pillaged the equivalent of $14,000 in crypto from the film producer’s wallet, according to a report published in the Malay Mail on July 8.

A second incident saw the 26-year old, who featured in a popular local movie called Abang Long Fadil 2, empty the wallet of nearly $36,000.

It is not clear which digital asset(s) Khan stole. Both incidents took place on the morning of March 7, 2019, in the upmarket suburb of Taman Ukay Perdana near Kuala Lumpur.

Khan, real name Mas Hidzhir Khan bin Mas Fadzillah Khan, pleaded guilty to the two charges after initial resistance.

In sentencing, a local magistrate ordered Khan to pay a fine of $1,600 for the first charge or face one year in jail. The second charge attracted a fine of $2,300 or 14 months imprisonment.

Khan was charged under a section of Malaysian law that provides for a maximum jail term of seven years or fine or both.

He sought a minimum fine on the grounds that he was the sole family breadwinner and had cooperated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation.

Andreas Antonopoulos discussed how he desired to see Bitcoin have more “privacy features” in a recent live stream Q&A session published on Youtube on July 7. Antonopoulos discussed the privacy-centric coin monero and concepts like stealth addresses and ring signatures.

Every once in a while, the well known cryptocurrency expert and evangelist, Andreas M. Antonopoulos, publishes a short clip of him answering a question from one of his live stream followers. On July 7, Antonopoulos discussed the Bitcoin (BTC) network and answered the question of whether or not “[BTC would] implement privacy features similar to monero?”

Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that uses a different proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. XMR is based on the Cryptonight PoW hash algorithm that originally stemmed from the Cryptonote protocol established in bytecoin. Essentially the project was a forked codebase of bytecoin and originally called “bitmonero.” What makes monero transactions hard to trace is the obfuscated public ledger and ring signatures used. Monero also leverages bulletproofs, and stealth (one-time) addresses.

After Antonopoulos read the question the entrepreneur said that of course he “wished” to see the BTC network add privacy features. Antonopoulos also named a number of concepts that could help bolster BTC’s privacy.

“I think what we’re going to see soon is Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript, which open the door to a lot of privacy improvements,” Antonopoulos said. “But they still do not involve zero-knowledge proofs or the types of ring signatures and stealth addresses that are done in Monero. Bitcoin is not a privacy coin.”

Bitcoin Core developers have yet to add any of the aforementioned privacy enhancing concepts to the main chain so far. Developers have, however, started laying the groundwork for concepts like Taproot and Schnorr Signatures. Interestingly, the team working on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol has already implemented the very basics of Schnorr in two upgrades.

On Twitter, one individual responded to Antonopoulos’s Q&A video tweet and mentioned a coin called “particl.”

“Particl is Bitcoin fork which has implemented Ring CT, which [also] got audited,” the person said to Antonopoulos. “If Bitcoin wants Ring CT it can implement it any day with the help of the Particl altcoin team,” he added. Antonopoulos responded to the individual on Twitter and tweeted:

Do you really think that the reason Bitcoin hasn’t implemented these changes is a lack of technical knowledge and a need for assistance to the Bitcoin developers? It’s not. It’s about the politics and conservative management of the engine that runs a very large economy.

At the time of publication, it is uncertain when BTC developers will implement things like Schnorr and Taproot. According to Andrew Poelstra, a Blockstream researcher has said that Taproot isn’t quite perfect, and “transaction amounts and the transaction graph are still exposed, which are much harder problems to address.”

The tweet from Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille, in regards to the new privacy features was published on January 23, but software developer Luke-jr added some commits two days ago, according to Github.

The listing would need the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) blessing. Were the watchdog to greenlight it, it would represent a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates vying for mainstream endorsement.

Coinbase could pursue the listing later this year or early next year, the sources said, cautioning that the plans are still subject to change. The company has not yet registered its intention to go public with the SEC, but has been in talks to hire investment banks and law firms, the sources added.

The sources requested anonymity because the listing preparations are confidential.

A Coinbase spokesman said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. The SEC declined to comment.

While the SEC has said some cryptocurrencies may be considered securities and be subject to regulation, it has yet to issue specific guidance on most virtual coins. Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win legitimacy among mainstream investors and a general public wary of their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.

VALUED AT $8 BILLION

One of the sources said that Coinbase, which was valued at more than $8 billion in its latest private fundraising round in 2018, is exploring going public via a direct listing instead of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).

In a direct listing, a company does not sell new shares as it does in an IPO and existing investors are not bound by lock-up restrictions on when they can divest their holdings following the market debut.

Founded in 2012, Coinbase is one of the most well-known cryptocurrency platforms globally and has more than 35 million users who trade various virtual coins, including bitcoin, ethereum and XRP.

The New York Stock Exchange, BBVA and former Citigroup Inc C.N CEO Vikram Pandit are among those that have invested in the San Francisco-based company. It was one of the top beneficiaries of the bitcoin BTC=BTSP boom in 2017, a year in which the original cryptocurrency rocketed from $1,000 to almost $20,000. Bitcoin currently trades at close to $9,400.

The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) issued a cease and desist order Wednesday against on Mirror Trading International (MTI), Forexandbitcoin.com and four individuals involved in a multi-level marketing scam.



Out of the four individuals, Cornelius Johannes Steynberg is a resident of South Africa, while Micheal Aaron Cullison, Steve Herceg and Brian D Knott have US residential addresses.



In its charge sheet, TSSB is alleging first that MTI is perpetrating a multi-level marketing company that promises lucrative commissions to its marketers.



Registered in South Africa, MTI claims it has “recruited” 76,000 members from more than 170 countries. Only since March 1, 2020, MTI says it has recruited 22,500 members.



However, TSSB says MTI’s marketers are “illegally soliciting Texans to purchase fraudulent investments in the cryptocurrency and forex trading pool.”



The Texan regulator asserts that investments in the cryptocurrency and forex trading pool are “securities” as that term is defined in Section 4.A of the Securities Act.



The cease and desist order says the four respondents are not registered with the Securities Commissioner as dealers and agents at the time when the securities where offered to Texans.



Therefore, the respondents are engaged in fraud in connection with the sale of the securities.



TSSB also states that Forexandbitcoin.com, Cullision, Herceg and Knott are acting as multi-level marketers for MTI.



The four are accused of touting the profitability, of not only the investments, but the multi-level marketing program as well.



Meanwhile, TSSB also singles out Herceg for targeting Texans impacted by changes to the economy in the wake of COVID-19.





Herceg is encouraging Texans to “put their governmental assistance stimulus/COVID check to work” by purchasing the investments.



In April, the FBI issued a global warning advising people to be on the lookout for cryptocurrency-related scams.



Also, the TSSB is accusing Cullison, Herceg and Knott of failing to disclose to potential investors about their previous bankruptcy filings.



Cullison has filed for bankruptcy four times between 1999 and 2015. Knott has filed twice and Herceg once.



The order also flags MTI for issuing disclaimers that force investors to indemnify it as well as its associates.

Respondents have 31 days to appeal the decision. If there are no representations, the four will face a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment if they continue operating.

The rise of DigiByte

As DigiByte (DGB) has risen in rank, the Uphold team gave an exhaustive overview of the project and why it should be on investors’ radar.

The first DGB was mined in 2014. Since then, much has not been heard about the project. While most businesses were poorly affected by the pandemic lockdown, DGB rose to become a more secure and faster version of Bitcoin. At the height of the pandemic through mid-May, DGB has rallied more than 900% to about $USD 0.03 under six weeks. At the beginning of June, Digibyte had established technical support moving close to the $0.02 mark.

Why do blockchain investors choose DGB?

Amidst other cryptocurrencies, DGB stands out due to its conspicuous features and that is why it has gained popularity amongst Blockchain investors.

Speed: With its capability of creating DGB blocks every 15 seconds for a transaction throughout, DGB has proven to be 40 times better than BTC in speed. DGB is also close to having 600 transactions per second and if it meets its goal of 2000, it would be ranked on the same level as Visa.

Scalability: In a day, DGB can carry out over 48 million transactions. Compared to the transaction capacity of top Blockchains, DGB is 10 times better.

Community-driven credibility: According to Cassiopeia, in charge of DGB public relations, DGB has attracted lots of followers because of its “genuine intention to create a financial system centered on people and social value.”

“The community-driven effort and the tremendous faith that all those involved in DGB have in the project are the key factors that make DGB so unique and compelling,” he added.

Recently, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that it has listed DigiByte (DGB). Binance represents one of the largest and highly respected cryptocurrency exchanges globally and they now introduce support for scalable PoW blockchain DigiByte (DGB). According to an announcement on June 12, Coinbase is also exploring Digibyte as one of the 18 new assets for possible support on its platform.

20 DigiByte Facts You Wouldn’t Want to Miss

DigiByte Partners with ThreeFold",2020-07-09 09:34:22+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-option-traders-bet-on-bullish-move-following-volatility-squeeze,"While bitcoin has gained 3% so far this week, the overall trading environment remains dull, with volatility hovering at multi-year lows.

Ten-day realized volatility, a historical metric, is now at just 20%, the lowest level for two years. That’s “a low that’s only preceded in [September and October] 2018,” the Singapore-based quantitative trading firm QCP Capital said on its Telegram channel.

Back in the autumn of 2018, the low-volatility consolidation ended with a big drop to below $6,000. This time, though, options traders are anticipating a breakout on the higher side.

“With the rise in one-month implied volatility this past week (on the back of more call buying) resulting in a notable divergence with realized volatility, a similar bang to end the lull is what option traders are betting on (this time with an upside break),” said QCP Capital.

BTC implied volatility Source: Skew

Bitcoin’s one-month implied volatility has risen from 46% to 55% over the past six days, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset will be in the future and is calculated by taking an option and the underlying asset’s price along with other inputs such as time to expiration.

Meanwhile, the one-month realized volatility has declined from 78% to 35%. Realized volatility represents the price volatility that has actualized in the past.

Realized volatility Source: Skew

The recent divergence between the two metrics is indicative of traders pricing in a transition from a low-volatility to a high-volatility trading environment over the next few four weeks.

Implied volatilities are primarily driven by the net buying pressure for options (calls/puts). The latest pickup looks to have been fueled by increased demand for call options or bullish bets, as noted by QCP Capital.

That is evident from the fact the one-month, three-month and six-month put-call skews are reporting negative values. Put-call skew measures the price of puts relative to that of calls.

Put-call skew Source: Skew

The one-month skew has dropped sharply from 11% to -5.4% this week. Negative values indicate that call options (or bullish bets) are drawing higher prices than put options (bearish bets). So, in effect, options traders are leaning bullish right now, with calls in greater demand.

It remains to be seen if the multi-week-long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000 ends with a bullish breakout, as expected.

The technical charts are also backing that scenario. For instance, the cryptocurrency breached a month-long falling channel on the higher side on Wednesday, signaling an end of the pullback from highs above $10,400 seen July 1.

Further, the MACD histogram, a momentum indicator, has crossed above zero in favor of the bulls.

The Venezuelan military has seized 315 Bitmain Antminer S9 bitcoin mining rigs it claims are not properly registered to operate in the country. Although cryptocurrency mining is legal in Venezuela, miners say they have been unfairly treated, citing illegal seizures of mining equipment and police extortion.

Venezuela Seizes Bitcoin Mining Equipment

The Bolivarian National Guard of Venezuela (GNB) announced via Twitter Monday that it has seized 315 Antminer S9 bitcoin mining rigs in the southern region of the country. The GNB is one of the largest divisions of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces.

The tweet explains that the GNB decided to seize the bitcoin mining equipment because the owner did not have proper registration papers. The case has been forwarded to the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (Sunacrip), the crypto regulator appointed by the government of Nicolas Maduro responsible for registering miners.

According to local news outlet Criptonoticias, this is the first known mining equipment confiscation by Venezuelan authorities in 2020. The one before this was in September 2019 in the state of Aragua, where mining rigs were also seized due to a lack of proper registration papers.

Miners Warn of Illegal Seizures and Extortion

Officially, the Venezuelan government has legalized cryptocurrency mining, requiring miners to register and obtain crypto mining certificates. However, cryptocurrency miners in the country have repeatedly said that mining equipment has been illegally seized and miners have been extorted by the police. A number of crypto miners told Criptonoticias that “mining cryptocurrencies in Venezuela has become a risky activity,” the publication conveyed, adding that some said police officials have demanded cash bribes to overlook mining equipment they have discovered.

Veteran crypto miner Joan Telo told the news outlet that when calculating mining profitability in Venezuela, miners must include extortion payments and losses from their equipment being confiscated. Despite crypto mining being a legal activity, he added that it “is carried out clandestinely and that inherent costs of migrating the entire operation to another location should be considered, once it is detected by the authorities.”

After beginning the year on a fairly steady course towards the $10k mark, Bitcoin–along with the rest of the economy–tanked.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

At the end of the second week of March, crypto markets fell so sharply that March 12th came to be colloquially known as “Crypto’s Black Thursday.” Between Wednesday, March 11th, and Friday, March 13th, the price of BTC fell from nearly $8,000 to roughly $4,700; by the end of the month, Bitcoin had recovered to roughly $6,400.

Since then, things have recovered considerably for BTC: by the end of April, Bitcoin had already hit back over the $9,000 level, where it managed to stay around for the rest of the quarter; the coin even briefly surpassed $10,000 on June 1st, and has floated between $9,000 and $10,000 ever since.

What has ensued since then has been–well, almost boring; almost a little too boring: in fact, the last 8 weeks or so have constituted one of the least volatile time-periods in Bitcoin’s recent history.

Why is this? And what does it mean?

Examining the past

Jay Hao, chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, told Finance Magnates that it is indeed quite unusual that “Bitcoin volatility has been very flat lately with BTC locked in a trading range for about two months.”

“This is very uncharacteristic of Bitcoin, as it is known for its rampant volatility,” he said.

Therefore, he believes that this period is not likely to continue for too much longer: “it is unlikely that this will continue and quite possible that BTC is gearing up for a big move,” he said. “In fact, the last time that Bitcoin was behaving like this was in April 2019 just before making a huge move.”

Indeed, April 2019 was quite a stable time for Bitcoin: after a jump upward at the beginning of the month, BTC floated between $4,800 and $5,300; by mid-May, the price of BTC was over $8000, and eventually peaked over $13,000 in July of 2019.

Therefore, it could be that Bitcoin is poised for another large upward movement: David Waslen, co-founder and chief executive of HedgeTrade, also told Finance Magnates that “generally speaking, a drawn-out period of low-volatility price consolidation will lead to a huge move on either side.”

“The longer the consolidation persists, the more violent the breakout or breakdown will end up being,” he explained.

”Investors are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see which way the market is going to move after breaking this range.”

But will the movement be a breakout or a breakdown?

“The volatility decline could likely be the result of a noticeable lack in clear directional bias concerning the market,” Waslen said. In other words: nobody knows.

Indeed, “uncertainty” seems to be the name of the game at the moment: Tanim Rasul, Head of Operations for Canadian cryptocurrency exchange NDAX, told Finance Magnates that uncertainty is the primary cause of the lack of volatility.

“The case for the bulls versus bears has been ongoing since Bitcoin has recovered from the COVID-19 price drop,” Rasul said.

Therefore, the lack of movement is resulting from–well, a lack of movement: “essentially, the price has been ranging for the past couple of months and many investors are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see which way the market is going to move after breaking this range,” Rasul explained.

Like Waslen and Hao, Rasul believes that extended flatlining in Bitcoin’s price could give way to a big move: “historically, Bitcoin’s volatility index paints a picture that low volatility does not last long and if the past repeats itself, we may see an incoming volatility spike.”

Bitcoin “is starting to act in similar ways to the stock market.”

But could the circumstances of the Bitcoin market alter the historical pattern of consolidation before volatility?

Indeed, OKEx’s Jay Hao told Finance Magnates that Bitcoin’s lack of volatility could be explained by the fact that “BTC is maturing as an asset class with a developed derivatives infrastructure, and it is therefore becoming less volatile.”

Collin Plume, founder and chief executive of Noble Gold Investments, also told Finance Magnates that the development of trading infrastructure could have something to do with the lack of volatility in Bitcoin.

“Now that Bitcoin has moved into the world of day traders and hedge funds, it is starting to act in similar ways to the stock market,” he said.

Therefore, a larger number of investors may be engaging with Bitcoin as they would with traditional markets–specifically, “one of the famous quotes in regards to the stock market is ‘sell in May, and go away’,” Plume said. “Traders used to liquidate their major trades and go on vacation for the summer.”

While there haven’t been signs of liquidation in recent months (aside from the market crash in March), it may very well be that the entrance of more traditional institutional traders into the space could mean that the summer months increasingly bring a ‘cooling’ effect to Bitcoin’s volatility levels–though, historically speaking, this hasn’t been the case.

”BTC traders love volatility”–so they may be looking for other markets

However, even if there has been an increase in Bitcoin traders who interact with the Bitcoin market as though it were the stock market, the Bitcoin traders who have traditionally focused on Bitcoin because of its volatility may have been left out in the cold by Bitcoin’s lack of movement.

David Waslen explained that indeed, traditionally speaking, “BTC traders love volatility.”

“To be able to profit off an asset class that can move 10% in a matter of minutes provides opportunities that you’re unable to find in a lot of the traditional asset classes,” he said. “Superior traders have been able to lock massive returns in the past.”

Therefore, “with the drop in volatility you’ve seen a drop in [trading] volume as traders are hesitant to take positions, as there are fewer opportunities.”

”Exchanges have seen very low trading volume lately.”

This is indeed the case–cryptocurrency exchanges that typically pull in much of their profits from BTC trades have gotten significantly less revenue from Bitcoin trading than they usually do.

OKEx’s Jay Hao said that indeed, “exchanges have seen very low trading volume lately.”

“Spot trading volume is the lowest that it has been in half a year, and the same pattern can be seen in derivatives,” he said.

“Since the value of Bitcoin derivatives is mainly reflected in hedging market risks, there is a stronger trading demand during periods of high volatility. The decline in bitcoin futures trading volume is mainly due to the continued decline in Bitcoin volatility.”

However, trading volumes on trading platforms outside of spot and derivatives markets don’t seem to have been affected in the same way: “that’s not necessarily the case with other cryptocurrency platforms, such as over-the-counter [trading venues,” Jay said.

For example, “if you consider Localbitcoins and Paxful, not only has trading volume not decreased, but it has actually increased in some places,” Hao said.

Is this the beginning of altcoin season?

Additionally, while the lack of volatility in Bitcoin may have caused a decrease in Bitcoin-related trading volume on exchanges, it seems to have caused an increase in trading volume related to altcoins, which have maintained higher levels of volatility.

“Traders looking to make big gains may start looking to the altcoin markets where coins like DOGE and COMP are allowing traders to capitalize off of high volatility,” Jay Hao said. This has “[…led] some to say that altcoin season has begun. If this is the case, then it is normal that we see less trading action on BTC.

Jay pointed specifically to tokens that have originated from the decentralized finance space as possible points of attention in crypto trading markets: “there has also been a lot of action in the DeFi space with DeFi tokens seeing massive gains,” he said.

DeFi tokens could be a new hotspot for traders in search of volatility

Indeed, the thing that seems to have called the most attention to the DeFi sphere in recent times is the surge in value of governance tokens of certain DeFi platforms–most famously, perhaps, the rise of COMP: the governance token of decentralized loan platform Compound, which jumped nearly 300% in value within a week of its mid-June launch.

So far, COMP has delivered on volatility: after peaking at roughly $372 last month, COMP gradually slipped as low as $165 over the course of several weeks–a decrease of roughly 55 percent. (By press time, the price had recovered to $176.

The quick succession of boom and bust has a number of analysts predicting further volatility in the future as the market eventually settles on what may be a more appropriate valuation of the company: Twitter commentator @ThetaSeek wrote that the project was overvalued, saying that “[…] The value of the Protocol is an AUM business and AUM businesses are normally valued at less than 1/3 or 1/4 of the companies’ AUM.

ThetaSeek said, pointing to BlockFi as an example: “@realblockfi is valued at around 200M when their AUM was 650M. (This is generous as Goldman Sachs is valued at less than 1/50 of their AUM),” he said. Therefore, he believes that COMP should be valued at something like $50.

The central bank’s balance sheet declined by $88 billion to $6.97 trillion (-1.5%) in the week ending July 8, having hit a record high of $7.16 trillion in early June, according to the data source Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The decline is the largest in 11 years.

The drop is a sign of the Fed starting to unwind the liquidity-boosting measures rolled out over the past four months to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus crisis. Some have anticipated a pullback in bitcoin prices as a result.

That’s because the leading cryptocurrency by market value has recently developed a relatively strong positive correlation with the S&P 500. And Wall Street’s equity index has rallied by over 40% since a slump in March, largely on the back of Fed’s balance sheet expansion.

As such, a contracting balance sheet could portend a pullback in stocks, and perhaps bitcoin.

However, zooming into the details of the Fed’s balance sheet reveals the reduction has been primarily driven by a drop in demand for emergency liquidity measures, a sign the coronavirus-induced stress in the financial system has eased.

“Less emergency funding being used is a healthy sign,” said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR. “Markets might not be able to stand completely on their own two feet, but they are at least a bit further from code red emergency mode.”

Goldilocks scenario?

Notably, dollar swap lines – reciprocal agreements between central banks to keep currency available for their commercial banks – have fallen by over $40 billion, as noted by Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.

The Fed opened dollar swap lines with other central banks after the coronavirus crash caused a dollar shortage in the international markets. Therefore, the latest decline in the dollar swap lines could be considered good news.

Meanwhile, the balance of outstanding repurchase agreements, or repos, slipped to zero from $61.2 billion seen in the week ended July 1. Repos are a source of short-term funding for commercial banks. The Fed began injecting liquidity in the repo market in mid-September 2019 and ramped up the effort following the market crisis in March.

As such, the decline in repos to zero indicates that the coronavirus-induced stress in the funding markets has eased significantly.

However, the Fed is still injecting liquidity into the U.S. economy via purchases of U.S. treasuries at a faster pace. The central bank accumulated treasuries worth $18 billion during the past week, pushing the overall bond holdings to a new high of $4.23 trillion.

All in all, the Fed’s balance sheet contraction and drop in repos and swap lines appear indicative of a Goldilocks scenario for equities, given the ongoing crisis at least, and seems unlikely to pose a threat to bitcoin’s price.

The cryptocurrency would still face stronger selling pressure if stocks once more collapse on adverse coronavirus news. But the market is still showing resilience with a measured drop, even though U.S. registered 65,551 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, a new daily record, according to John Hopkins University.

At press time, futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.33% decline, while bitcoin is changing hands near $9,170, having faced rejection above $9,400 on Thursday.",2020-07-10 12:06:20+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/07/163888-coinbase-reportedly-planning-ipo-crypto-industry-comments-on-possibility-of-first-digital-asset-exchange-to-go-public-in-the-us/,"Coinbase is reportedly planning an initial public offering (IPO) at some point later this year or early next. First reported by Reuters, the news really comes as no surprise as its valuation has risen dramatically and the digital asset sector of Fintech continues to gain market traction. The report said that Coinbase may consider a direct listing as opposed to an underwritten offering. Coinbase was last valued at around $8 billion. It will be very interesting to see how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) handles a public offering of a digital asset exchange.

Coinbase is one of the largest digital asset exchange in the US. Unlike some other crypto exchanges, Coinbase has pursued a compliant approach taking pains to adhere to regulations while working with regulatory officials. The company has helped to define the cryptocurrency industry in the US and has been a leader in offering new products and services. Coinbase is also a partner in a top stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), a fiat-collateralized stablecoin created in partnership between Circle. Unlike Tether – the largest stablecoin by market cap, USDC audits the one to one relationship with the dollar.

Coinbase reports more than 35 million users with $7 billion in custody having facilitated over $220 billion since the launch of the digital asset marketplace.

If Coinbase is successful in listing shares on a regulated US exchange it would be a dramatic step in the direction of legitimizing an industry that was once best known for ICO scams, data breaches, and money laundering. For any Fintech service, proper regulation is key for sustainability.

This morning, Crowdfund Insider received several comments from crypto industry insiders pertaining to the report of a forthcoming Coinbase IPO.

Nick Cowan, CEO of the Global Stock Exchange (GSX) Group – an operator of a regulated digital asset exchange, said that any advances towards crypto business IPOs makes for very interesting analysis, and in particular, adds a new layer of legitimacy to the sector.

“Some Bitcoin mining companies made similar announcements last year, and some crypto-asset exchanges have made parallel inroads this year, pointing to the ongoing maturation of the crypto space. Given the fact that Bitcoin was born on the back of the previous 2008 financial crisis, it seems as though the timing of this news, given the economic impact of COVID-19, is interesting to say the least. Many of the most prominent blockchain projects are now moving into the next stages of development and further fundraising will go a long way to ensure further innovation,” said Cowan.

Dave Hodgson, Chief Investment Officer of NEM Group & Managing Director of NEM Ventures, called the report of a Coinbase IPO as positive for the industry:

“It will certainly put crypto into the mainstream press which always helps adoption. Coinbase now has a strong mix of retail and institutional client bases, so a listing would also give retail investors a way to gain exposure to both of these markets, beyond simply holding tokens. Coinbase has already been making good ground recently in retail with its issuance of debit cards and dollar-cost averaging.”

Hodgson said the regulator shouldn’t have an issue with the listing as Coinbase is regulated and holds relevant licenses in operational jurisdictions.

“They are a financial services company, similar to any other digital bank. However, time will tell if that assumption holds true and if the listing is even real–until it is confirmed by the company and the details are known it is very hard to speculate on the likelihood of approval,” Hodgson added.

Kristen Stone, a former Product Manager at Coinbase and now a Business Development executive at Blockdaemon, said a Coinbase IPO is an opportunity for the mainstream to be involved in crypto in a clear and direct way.

Stone said the IPO should generate a lot of demand:

“… Coinbase is bridging the gap between the traditional markets and the future of finance. As a result, the underlying assets and the adoption of those assets will continue to gain traction. When considering the implications of the news around global regulation around crypto-assets this is not particularly pertinent. Regulation is a recurring topic of conversation in crypto, but I don’t think it’s a relevant question to discuss broadly as it varies largely across jurisdictions. Much like the internet, there will be waves of regulation in crypto but the momentum and interest are substantial and unlikely, if not impossible, to derail the adoption curve we are seeing.”

Stone said that Coinbase is the most trusted company in the crypto space. It set the precedent of meeting regulatory requirements across the board; at the federal level becoming registered as a money service business and at the state level obtaining and maintaining licenses where applicable.

“By putting regulatory requirements first, Coinbase became the most trusted company in this space. I expect it has done the same in this situation, implying there will be limited pushback from the SEC,” Stone stated.

Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of Stablehouse, a payment and FX exchange platform serving stablecoin issuers, merchants, end-users, and traders, said that a succesful IPO will be an important milestone that will set a valuation benchmark for the space.

“Coinbase is not the first global crypto giant rumoured to consider an IPO, and others have tried and failed in the past. The most notable was perhaps the application by Bitmain Technologies in China, which was later shelved in 2019. I anticipate that the majority of issues that Coinbase may face will come from auditing. What’s important to remember is that when reviewing an IPO application, the SEC will examine Coinbase first and foremost as a company, rather than the activities of the crypto industry as a whole. In this sense, a potential green light for a Coinbase IPO will be more a symbolic move, rather than a ringing endorsement of cryptocurrencies from the SEC.”

Erick Pinos, Ecosystem lead at Ontology America, had a different perspective noting that rumblings of a Coinbase IPO has generated some community backlash as it means a company that is ostensibly seeking to upend the current marketplace would be going through the system it is attempting to replace.

“Still, a Coinbase IPO would no doubt be a symbolic achievement of regulatory acceptance and a step towards legitimizing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the public’s eye. Approval of the IPO application is likely, given Coinbase’s careful consideration to US regulation, particularly in relation to KYC and only listing assets following intense legal scrutiny and due diligence. Coinbase has long been an industry leader, so we are likely to begin to see other exchanges follow suit. However, the more tokens an exchange supports, or the more an exchange’s operations are conducted outside of the US, the more difficult it’ll be for IPO applications to be approved. Coinbase is in its own league in terms of public reputation and avoiding regulatory gray areas, followed only by other leading exchanges like Gemini or Circle.”

Ashish Singhal, CEO and Co-founder of CRUXPay and Coinswitch.co, said the journey to a successful IPO will be difficult but if any company in the US has a chance of succeeding it is Coinbase:

“One major obstacle will likely be the regulation of cryptocurrencies overall in the US. The SEC has said in the past that while some cryptocurrencies can be classified as securities and be regulated, it has no clear idea on how to regulate most cryptocurrencies. If Coinbase can overcome these obstacles and prove successful, it will have a significant impact. It will bring legitimacy, adoption and awareness to the industry. This will also force regulators across the world to take a more serious look at crypto regulations and not just keep delaying it. This will be a historical moment and could very well pave a bright future for the crypto ecosystem not just in the US but all over the world.”

Seamus Donoghue, VP Sales and Business Development at METACO, said a Coinbase IPO is another sign that crypto markets are no longer the “wild west:”

“They are coming of age and their main participants, of which in the context of regulated retail markets Coinbase is one of the largest, are maturing into mainstream financial institutions. The higher level of regulatory compliance required of public companies would enable Coinbase to build more institutional partnerships such as the recently announced banking partnership with JP Morgan and will ultimately drive broader acceptance of, and access to crypto markets. In terms of regulation, a listing would bring significantly more transparency and disclosure requirements for Coinbase, which would certainly be a strong value proposition for clients that are uncomfortable about the counterpart risk they are taking when they leave their funds on an exchange. If the listing results in strong client inflows for Coinbase, then others both in the US and globally, will undoubtedly take note that it is a path to build trust in their marketplaces and public listings could become popular for other major exchanges.”

Donoghue said he does not anticipate any concerns from the SEC as this is a growing and key industry player moving from the less regulated private markets to the highly regulated public markets.

“I expect the SEC would be a strong champion of such a move,” said Donoghue.

Adam Traidman, CEO of BRD, a secure mobile cryptocurrency wallet, said that Coinbase has been a competitor of theirs for quite some time as a crypto wallet:",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/71174/ledgerx-is-taking-another-shot-at-a-bitcoin-fear-gauge,"LedgerX is taking another stab at a VIX-like bitcoin volatility index.

Announced Friday, the so-called BitVol Index is the result of a partnership between the New York-based options venue and T3 Index, a provider of options-based indices. Similar to Wall Street's fear gauge—the VIX—BitVol measures the 30-day implied volatility of bitcoin, leveraging LedgerX's market data.

This isn't LedgerX first attempt at a bitcoin volatility index. In 2019, it launched the LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX). But chief executive officer Zach Dexter said the new product will draw on data from multiple sources.

""The more data we can add, the more high-quality of an index we can display,"" he said in a phone interview with The Block.

For now, the index will be visible on LedgerX's platform. It is also visible on Refinitiv's Eikon—a rival to the ubiquitous Bloomberg terminals that pepper Wall Street. Dexter said it could serve as a resource for options traders, such as those who might want to buy calls if they see a dip in volatility. Call options are cheaper when volatility decreases.

It could also lure participants to the firm's market, which has lagged behind rivals like Deribit, CME Group, and OKEx.

Looking to the future, Dexter said T3 and LedgerX could ""commercialize"" the index, meaning build a tradable product on top of it. Such a product would be a first in the bitcoin market. LedgerX wouldn't move forward with listing the product on its market until it received all of the necessary regulatory approvals, Dexter stressed.

On Wall Street, traders have poured into the VIX and strategies relating to volatility have soared, as recently reported by The Wall Street Journal. Specifically, more than a trillion dollars’ worth of derivatives bets connected to the VIX have traded since the beginning of the year, according to The Journal.

T3's Simon Ho said that the commercialization of BitVol could lead to the development of additional products tied to bitcoin's volatility and allow traders to execute new types of strategies.

""It could engender cross-asset trading between [BitVol] and the VIX,"" he said.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-app-bottlepay-is-back-from-the-dead-with-a-new-lightning-app,"The social payments app Bottlepay (née Bottle Pay) aims to relaunch in the next few weeks, after shuttering due to regulations in December 2019.

After restructuring the bitcoin wallet product to fit Europe’s anti-money laundering directive (AMLD5), the British startup is offering an exchange wallet with social features on Reddit, Twitter and Discord. Bottlepay co-founder Pete Cheyne said there are over 1,000 people on the waitlist for the closed beta relaunch in August.

“Because we’re moving to an app-native product there’s a lot more we can do,” Cheyne said. “We’re also adding in the ability to have scheduled payments to buy more bitcoin.”

Square’s Cash App and others already offer this feature in the United States, but in Europe, where Bottlepay is focused, there’s even an added feature that forwards the bitcoin to another wallet address if desired. This means users may choose custodial or non-custodial services.

“Lightning works in the background, without users having to manage channels,” Cheyne added. “There will be a small fee for exchanging between fiat and bitcoin, and vice versa. … There will also be tiers because people are interested in our app for different use cases.”

Bottlepay CEO Mark Webster said his team of 11 employees has “constant funding” from their angel investors, who previously traded equity for $2 million in 2019. Webster added the company won’t support tokens in the near future, although it might someday. This year it is all about bitcoin.

“I think Lightning is at the core of the strategy,” Webster said, referring to the bitcoin scaling solution. “As consumer demand increases we can open more channels.”

As part of this shift, Webster said he is hiring, not tightening his belt for the recession, hoping to grow the team to roughly 35 people by 2021. Cheyne said several of the hires so far have been for the marketing and legal teams, which did a vast restructuring of the product. The added hassle of know-your-customer requirements also created an opportunity for wallet features.

“You can store a fiat balance,” Cheyne said. “Scan a Lightning code and pay that from your pound or euro balance.”

For now, Bottlepay will only open the beta program to users in Europe. But Webster said the company hopes to open the beta to Americans and reactivate Telegram options by 2021. When it does, it may be one of the few fiat-friendly wallets that leverages Lightning without any hassle for the user.

Announced on Thursday, the US attorney Craig Carpenito announced that Silviu Catalin Balaci was arrested in Germany and his guilty plea was taken by the US court via video conferencing.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

He has been charged with one count of a dual-object conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.

The official filing detailed that the BitClub Network was a fraudulent scheme that solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of purported cryptocurrency mining pools and rewarded investors for recruiting new investors into the scheme. The fraudulent scheme ran from April 2014 through December 2019.

The crypto mining fraud case was highlighted last year when the US authorities nabbed the masterminds – Matthew Brent Goettsche, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, and Joseph Frank Abel – all of whom are US residents.

According to the official announcement, Balaci assisted Goettsche and Medlin in creating and operating the BitClub Network and served as a programmer for the BitClub Network.

Crypto investors are ‘sheep(s)’

The BitClub Network told investors that they could invest in three different Bitcoin mining pools; however, Balaci admitted that the operators were never maintaining three separating mining operations. He even changed the figures displayed as bitcoin mining earnings to make it appear that the BitClub Network was earning more than what was actually being mined.

“As a part of the scheme, Balaci and Goettsche discussed that the target audience for the BitClub Network would be “dumb” investors, referred to them as ‘sheep,’ and plotted that they would be ‘building this whole model on the backs of idiots’,” the US Department of Justice noted.

The programmer is now looking at a maximum prison time of five years and a fine of $250,000, or twice the pecuniary gain to the defendant or loss to the victims.",2020-07-10 08:14:36+00:00,https://asiatimes.com/2020/07/why-kazakhstan-is-attracting-bitcoin-miners/,"Kazakhstan is becoming an important destination for bitcoin (BTC) miners seeking cheap electricity in the post-halving market driven by thinner margins. According to recent reports, the oil-rich Central Asian country expects the total amount of money invested in local crypto mining operations to double by the end of 2020 and attract $738 million over the next three years, Cointelegraph journalist Stephen O’Neal reported.

From blanket crypto ban to legalization

The Kazakh government has adopted an overall friendly approach to crypto recently, although there is still little regulatory clarity on the subject. However, positive developments were preceded by regulatory turbulence, and at one point, its central bank went as far as to suggest a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies.

In early 2018, the chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, Daniyar Akishev, declared that his agency was considering outlawing all cryptocurrencies. Just a few months later, Kazakhstan’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, called for global cooperation in crypto regulation but did not mention whether this regulation should encourage the sector’s growth or its containment.

Previously in 2017, Kazakhstan’s government-supported Astana International Finance Center signed a deal with Malta-based firm Exante to develop the Kazakh digital asset market, while the central bank announced it was considering using blockchain to sell short-term debt notes to investors.

Things started to look more concrete and positive for local crypto miners in 2019. In December of last year, local media reported that Kazakhstan’s lawmakers wouldn’t be taxing cryptocurrency mining until the mined assets are exchanged for fiat money, as crypto mining would not be treated as an entrepreneurial activity but rather a “purely technological process.”

A recent bill, which was approved by the Kazakh Senate and signed into law by Nazarbayev earlier in June, essentially legalizes mining, saying that people involved in digital mining are obliged to inform the authorities about their activities. It also stresses that miners are the legal owners of the digital assets they produce.

Didar Bekbauov, founder of crypto mining marketplace Xive – a local company providing hosting services for large-scale international miners – and who previously worked at Hive Mining, said the current regulation is not strict, but stressed that the framework hasn’t been finalized yet: “The bill says miners need to report to [the] government about their activities. But nobody still knows how it will be in practice. Other than that no regulations.”

Cheap electricity attracts foreign players

According to Bekbauov, the main mining players in Kazakhstan are foreign companies from China, Japan and “other Asian countries.” There is also Genesis Mining, an international cloud mining company with farms located across several countries, and Bitfury, another non-Chinese mining powerhouse headquartered in Amsterdam.

“They are miners with experience, some private funds, private investors,” Bekbauov said of the companies mining away in Kazakhstan. The Xive founder added that around 90% of their mining activities are performed on the bitcoin blockchain, and he said that the arrival of foreign companies doesn’t make it harder for local mom-and-pop mining operations, as Kazakhstan “still has excess electricity generation.”

Therefore, the main attraction for miners is not the regulatory framework, which still remains ambiguous despite some positive developments, but rather the abnormally cheap electricity rates. As of December 2019, the price of electricity in Kazakhstan was $0.041 per kilowatt-hour for households and $0.049 for businesses. For comparison, the average electricity price in the United States is $0.14, although some states such as Texas seem to be offering competitive prices under certain conditions.

The price of electricity has always been one of the main factors when it comes to cryptocurrency mining, but it has become even more important after the bitcoin halving took place back in May. The halved reward prompted miners to either sell their equipment or relocate to regions with cheaper electricity such as Kazakhstan, Russia, the Middle East and South America.

Along with the abundance of cheap electricity, Kazakhstan’s geographical position also makes it “a fast-growing hotbed for bitcoin mining action,” according to Thomas Heller, global business director of F2Pool, who said: “Kazakhstan is located in an optimal location for mining. The climate is cool, and is in close proximity to China. It’s becoming a popular location for Chinese miners to move old-gen machines from China to Kazakhstan to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices outside of the Sichuan Hydro Season.”

Bekbauov said that most local mining operations are located in regions with high electricity generation – such as Ekibastuz, Karagandy, Pavlodar and Taraz – while the country has an overall good climate for crypto mining throughout most of the year.

Dmitrii Ushakov, chief commercial officer of BitRiver – a major co-location services provider for bitcoin mining in the Commonwealth of Independent States region – confirmed that the cheap electricity prices in Kazakhstan are luring investors in, saying: “Miners can currently find very attractive electricity prices for mining in Kazakhstan and some other former Soviet countries. This is the main reason for the current interest in mining in Kazakhstan.”

However, Ushakov added that there are “no natural prerequisites for cheap electricity in the country,” as it is mainly produced by coal-fired power plants. He elaborated, expanding on some other drawbacks of Kazakhstan-based mining, namely an overall unstable situation in the region and inadequate safety of local mining farms: “This is risky because the markets and other factors affecting the price of such electricity within a nation can change quickly. Another aspect that should be considered here is the safety of these mining sites, which are often set up in a very short time by using pre-existing infrastructure that is old and unreliable.”

Will Kazakhstan become a top-three mining destination?

Last month, Kazakhstan’s minister of digital development, innovation and aerospace industry, Askar Zhumagaliyev, announced that the department is planning to attract 300 billion tenge, or $738 million, worth of investments by 2023 for activities related to cryptocurrency mining.

Kazakhstan’s ambitious mining plans might seem staggering at first, but the country has some statistics to back them up. According to Zhumagaliyev, there are currently 14 cryptocurrency mining farms that have already brought in approximately $201.7 million of investments combined.

Further, the Bitcoin Mining Map designed by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance at the Judge Business School of the University of Cambridge shows that the countries in the CIS region combined comprise the fourth-largest region for crypto mining globally.

In the second quarter of 2020, mining in Kazakhstan has reportedly made up about 6.17% of the average monthly bitcoin hash rate, which is only slightly behind Russia (6.9%) and the United States (7.24%), while China remains the undisputed king (over 65%).

Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of mining pool Poolin, agreed that under certain conditions, Kazakhstan could become third in the near future: “With the abundance of cheap electrical prices, mild temperatures and the governments ’hands-off’ approach to mining, I do indeed foresee Kazakhstan becoming a top-3 crypto mining destination.”

Other experts are more skeptical. BitRiver’s Ushakov argued that although low electricity prices are a solid advantage for Kazakhstan in the mining race, the region itself isn’t stable enough to witness significant growth: “Although low electricity prices make Kazakhstan a hot destination to mine, we believe that China, Russia and the USA will continue to be the top-3 mining destinations in the world because of increasing investments in mining, predictable energy policies and a more stable political as well as economic environment for mining.”",2020-07-10 14:28:51+00:00

You would have to own around 108 BTC, at current prices, to become a US dollar millionaire (in Bitcoin). The number of Bitcoin addresses with balances of more than $1 million reached a record high during the historic crypto market bull run of 2017. In December of 2017, the BTC price had surged to nearly $20,000 and the market cap of all crypto-assets had surpassed the $800 billion mark by early January 2018.

It’s worth noting that the digital currency market has not been able to reach these historic highs, or even get close to them, during the past few years. Despite Bitcoin (and the larger crypto market) prices not being able to break previous highs, Glassnode data confirms that the number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC have remained at about the same levels in recent years.

It’s possible that many of these BTC addresses belong to large cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset custodians, who have consistently maintained large amounts of Bitcoin (and other cryptos) in their reserves. Notably, there are more than 1 million Bitcoins which were most likely mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Satoshi’s coins have not moved during the past 10 years.

Although it’s possible to check how many BTC addresses hold at least $1 million worth of the digital currency, it can’t really be determined just how many individuals are actually Bitcoin millionaires.

We would have to find out how many people or entities control the 13,290 BTC addresses with $1 million (or more) in Bitcoins, in order to estimate out how many Bitcoin millionaires there are. This may not be practical because many people don’t publicly disclose their wealth.

Read Russo’s reflections on Ethereum after five years here.

The sale started on July 22 at midnight in Switzerland. The website they put together for the sale had a real-time counter of the amount of ether sold, and the team watched with relief as the numbers ticked up. More than 7 million ether, or about $2.2 million, were sold just in the first 12 hours. It had been a long, hard wait since December and January, when most of them started working for the project. Everyone was worn out, and most were broke.

“We have been promising that the sale would arise in two weeks for six months, and many team members have endured substantial hardships because of expectations that we set regarding when we would be able to provide funding,” Vitalik [Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder] wrote in a blog post announcing the sale. “We certainly miscalculated the sheer difficulty of navigating the relevant legal processes in the United States and Switzerland, as well as the surprisingly intricate technical issues surrounding setting up a secure sale website and cold wallet system.”

At the start of the sale and for fourteen days the price was set so that one bitcoin bought 2,000 ether. At the end of the 14-day period the amount would decline linearly to a final rate of 1,337 ether, which meant that one ether was worth 0.0007479 bitcoin or about 30 cents at bitcoin prices in September 2014.

While prices for the sale were fixed, the amount that would be issued was not, so purchasers could buy as much ether as they wanted to. When investors sent their bitcoin to the EthSuisse wallet address, though, they didn’t immediately get ether in return. They got an Ethereum wallet and password that would allow them to access their ether when the platform launched. It was a way to reduce the speculative nature of the sale, and have the token be traded only once it could be actually used.

The Ethereum network launch was targeted for the (Northern Hemisphere) winter of 2014-15. The Ethereum team would create ether according to the amount raised in the sale when the first block in the Ethereum blockchain was mined. There was a second pool of ether that would be issued for the cofounders and other early team members, which would be 9.9 percent of the amount raised, and a third pool of ether of the same size would be created for the Ethereum Foundation.

This type of cryptocurrency issuance is known as a “premine,” as the coins are created before the network is generating tokens on its own, like Bitcoin does to reward its miners. The concept is controversial, as some enthusiasts will argue Satoshi Nakamoto gave anyone who was interested the same opportunity to gain bitcoin when the network was launched, as he announced when mining would begin and published the software beforehand. In the case of Bitcoin, the total supply of coins is created by miners. Ethereum and other projects that premine their coins are criticized because control of the cryptocurrency’s supply is potentially more centralized among “insiders” who participated in the presale and could manipulate the price or influence governance decisions. Before Ethereum, almost any cryptocurrency project that had a premine would be quickly written off as a scam. Ethereum didn’t entirely change that, and it’s still criticized because of it, but it did help legitimize the concept.

Podcast host and Bitcoin enthusiast Matt Odell brought up these criticisms in October 2018 and Vitalik responded on Twitter, “I personally am really proud to have helped set the precedent of small premines being legitimate. It’s an appalling idea that people operating boxes burning huge piles of electricity are somehow the only ones who should be allowed to gain from crypto seignorage revenue.”

The sale documents said that once the Ethereum blockchain launched and the premined ether was issued, miners would generate new ether initially at an annual rate of 26% of the amount of ether issued in the crowdsale – the issuance rate isn’t fixed and is capped at 18 million ETH minted per year. That means the supply of ether would grow over time but at a decreasing rate. The increasing supply means that large holders’ stakes will gradually decline relative to the total supply and ownership will tend to be more decentralized, while a declining growth rate avoids flooding the market with ether and pushing down its price. An uncapped supply for Ethereum also ensures that those supporting the network will always be rewarded with new ether. That’s another difference with Bitcoin, which is designed to have a fixed supply of 21 million.

The Ethereum documents and Vitalik’s blog posts said they give no guarantees of ether’s future value but the chart they showed in the terms-and-conditions document, with a downward sloping line to represent the ether supply growth rate, surely gave prospective buyers reason to be hopeful.

Bitcoin continued to trickle in, and on the seventh day of the crowdsale, Tuesday, July 29, Ken [Seiff] decided to make the plunge. He had moved back to New York from San Francisco just four days earlier. He and his wife were staying at the Ludlow Hotel in the East Village while the moving trucks were on their way from the West Coast with their belongings, and their children were staying at their grandparents’ in Florida to avoid the majority of the move.

He was working at one of his venture fund’s investor’s offices until he got his own place. It had been a fairly typical day. He had been in meetings with investors and portfolio companies since the early morning and had come back to his borrowed desk in the evening to return calls and get to his outstanding emails.

Bitcoin was about $580 that day, and each bitcoin purchased 2,000 ether, making the cost of 1 ether about $0.29, Ken calculated. Used to thinking in venture capital terms, Ken equated Bitcoin to a later stage, Series D investment, while Ethereum was a seed investment. That meant ether had more room to grow, but also a higher likelihood of failure. Ethereum, with its ability to support all kinds of blockchain applications, also had the potential of being even bigger than Bitcoin, Ken thought.

He had gone through these arguments many times in his head, but he revisited them as he went to the Ethereum.org white and gray website. At the center was the amount of ether sold so far. To the left of that number was the amount of days left in the sale and to the right was the amount of days left at the current price, an interface that not so subtly said “hurry up and give us your bitcoin.” Below those numbers was a black button that said, “Buy Ether,” along with links to the terms and conditions, the purchase agreement, the white paper, and the intended use of revenue. He had already gone over those documents but he skimmed through them once more. “Ownership of ETH carries no rights . . . purchases are non-refundable . . . cryptofuel . . . distributed applications,” he read and took a deep breath. “Okay, let’s do this.”

His heart beat faster, and he had no idea what to expect when he clicked the “Buy Ether” button. A new page with a three-step process appeared. Step 1, the website told him, “Enter the amount to purchase in either Bitcoin or Ether.” The minimum was 0.01 bitcoin and the maximum was 500,000 bitcoin. The cap was in place to prevent buyers from owning a disproportionately large stake of the total ether sold and the terms and conditions said “EthSuisse will restrict any single entity, person, corporation, or group from controlling more than 12.5% of the total ETH sold by the end of the Genesis Sale” – but it’s unclear from the documentation exactly how they’d be able to keep track, since all that was needed to buy ether was an email address. Also, EthSuisse would be dissolved right after the sale.

Ken wasn’t planning on giving up 500,000 bitcoin, but it was a substantial amount of his personal wealth that he had decided to bet on Ethereum. He typed in the amount. Step 2 was to type in his email address, and Step 3 was to create a passphrase that would be used to encrypt and access his wallet. He checked everything a million times and clicked on “Continue.” Step 4 told him to “move his mouse around the screen to generate a random wallet, and once you’re done you will be moved on to the next screen.” “This is so weird,” he thought, as he complied, his anxiety surging when he realized there was no back button. Next, he clicked on a button that downloaded an Ethereum wallet to his computer, and then there was a Bitcoin wallet address and QR code for him to send his bitcoin to. He went to his Bitcoin wallet, copied the address – a jumbled-up string of numbers and letters – and letting out a muffled scream, “Aaaahhh!” he clicked send.

And just like that, he had parted with half of his perfectly good bitcoin, which were now traveling into some cryptographic maze. “Into the ether!” he couldn’t help thinking. This was one of the scariest moments of his life. There were no charge-backs in blockchain. If he copied the wrong address, or messed up one of the steps, there would be no way of getting his bitcoin back. In the world of crypto, there was no arbiter (that was the whole point), and when the roughly 10 minutes it takes to confirm transactions in the Bitcoin network were up, the transfer would be permanent and virtually immutable. He sat back, and just stared at his laptop screen for a while. It was done.

Thousands of other people must have been thinking the same thing as they sent their bitcoin into what seemed like the dark void of the Ethereum sale. It’s hard to say exactly how many, but the blockchain shows more than 6,600 transactions going into EthSuisse’s Bitcoin address. The total number of people who participated is likely much smaller, though, as big buyers probably split their purchases into several different wallets.

By the end of the sale, people behind those jumbled addresses had bought more than 60 million ether, which at around 30 cents per coin amounted to $18.3 million. It was a huge success. There had been only five similar crowdsales done by cryptocurrency projects before Ethereum’s Genesis Sale and the second-largest raise had been by Maidsafe for $6 million. It was also a success compared with crowdsales in general. Seven months later, Mihai [Alisie] would publish a blog post that said, “according to Wikipedia, Ethereum is rated as the second-biggest crowdfunded project in the history of the internet, sitting proudly next to the first occupant that raised over $70 [million], but over the course of years, not 42 days.”

Mihai had turned 27 during the sale on July 25, and the Ethereum team that was still in Zug [Switzerland] decorated the house with colorful banners and took the chance to celebrate both Mihai growing older and the bitcoin that was flowing in. All the laptops in the house had the website permanently open, so that as they had their drinks and ate birthday cake, the big number at the center of the page that showed the pile of ether they had sold was quietly and steadily ticking up.

Now anyone could be an investor in one of the most cutting-edge technology companies out there. All they needed was an internet connection and at least 0.01 bitcoin.

“I have to admit that we all had high hopes, but no one was anticipating that in 24 hours we would surpass any previous initiative in the space. In any case, it was one of the most fulfilling birthday presents ever and proof that we weren’t crazy, or that there are many other crazy people out there and we’d found each other,” Mihai wrote.

The Ethereum team had actually written down what those high hopes were. In a document called “Intended Use of Revenue,” they included three scenarios: one in case they got $9 million or less in the sale, $9 million to $22.5 million was the second one, and more than $22.5 million was the third. The very worst case for them already meant beating all other previous cryptocurrency crowdsales. In all cases, $1.8 million was allocated to expenses incurred before the sale and $1 million was to be set aside for a legal contingency fund. Of the rest, 76.5 percent went to the developers, 13.5 percent went to communications and community outreach, and 10 percent went to research.

The total supply of ETH started out at 72 million as 5.9 million (the stipulated 9.9 percent of the 60 million raised) was created for 83 early contributors and an equal amount was issued for the foundation. Vitalik got the biggest share of the contributors’ endowment at about 553,000 ether. Stephan Tual, who was leading communications in London, would later make a big stink with an angry post on Reddit, leaking information about how much specific people had gotten, especially when he didn’t think they’d contributed much to the effort.

Vitalik had designed a whole system for calculating allocations based on the date individuals had joined the project and the hours they contributed to it. The foundation wasn’t allowed to invest in the crowdsale, so that it wouldn’t get a disproportionate stake and raise the centralization red flag, and it could only withdraw 5,000 bitcoin while the presale was running to speed up development. The limit was put in place to avoid any suggestion that the foundation was reinvesting the bitcoin it got to inflate volume.

But there was no rule about the endowment recipients buying up more ETH in the sale, as long as they didn’t break the rule of owning more than 12.5 percent of the total supply. Still, there was no way of enforcing that limit. There was a big incentive for cofounders to buy more in the sale, as the amount they would get as part of the endowment depended on the total raised. Put simply, whatever money they put in they’d essentially get more free money back. Those who had lent money to Ethereum also got paid back their loans plus 25 to 50 percent of interest, depending on when they were made. Vitalik had lent more than half the money he had to the foundation and didn’t have many funds left to put in. Joe Lubin is rumored to be the biggest holder of ETH to come out of the crowdsale, though he says that’s not the case.

Critics in the BitcoinTalk forum and elsewhere didn’t go quiet when they saw Ethereum’s success. With no proof to support their claims, they posited that volume was being manipulated by the foundation and the Ethereum team to draw in more buyers. How else to explain why Ethereum’s volume was so much higher than other crowdsales?

Preston Byrne, an attorney focusing on early-stage companies and cryptocurrency businesses, published an April 2018 blog post stating that “most of the ether sold in the 2014 token pre-sale in exchange for bitcoin may have been paid out to one person or, more likely, a handful of close associates working in concert,” because the chart showing the flow of bitcoin was unnaturally even, and almost exactly the same as the chart of a mathematical power function. Something so perfect, he suggested, signaled the work of a bot. Byrne said it was highly suspicious that “the initial two week-period of the Ethereum pre-sale looks more than merely typical, there’s very little randomness in it – it looks perfect,” and, “unless Vitalik subtly managed to telepathically hack everyone’s brains so buyers would participate in the pre-sale in an organized fashion,” it’s likely that enough ether to move markets is concentrated in not a lot of people. Research firm Chainalysis later confirmed the suspicion that ether distribution is concentrated. Only 376 holders control 33 percent of the circulating ether supply, a May 2019 report found.

One anonymous cryptocurrency researcher who goes by the online name of Hasu did further analysis of the sale after Byrne’s post. He found the two bumps in demand during the sale, one at the beginning and one at the end of the 42-week period, are an expected consequence of people buying right before the ether price increased. Still, like Byrne, he didn’t find an explanation for “why the graph looks so damn smooth.”

While Vitalik hopes there was no manipulation by insiders, and says he didn’t engage in such practices, he says ultimately he has no way of knowing whether some may have done it. As for himself, he barely had enough money to invest as he had spent most of it bootstrapping Ethereum.

Incentives for early contributors to participate in the sale and get others to do so, and the unnaturally even chart patterns, point to possible manipulation during the ether sale. But the amount of money raised was also a reflection of an intensely anticipated project led by a teenager hailed as a genius coder, building the next-generation blockchain.

A whole new financing model had been tested. One where a ragtag group of feuding hackers with no business plan and no live product, let alone users or revenue, could raise millions of dollars from thousands of people from all over the world. Before, anyone who wanted to buy stock in big tech firms like Facebook or Google would need a U.S. bank account; things got even more complicated for those who wanted to invest in startups that hadn’t gone to the public markets to raise funds. Now anyone could be an investor in one of the most cutting-edge technology companies out there. All they needed was an internet connection and at least 0.01 bitcoin.

Ken followed up with Gavin in January to see how the launch was coming along. They had promised the platform (and therefore Ken’s ether) would be live around that time.

Zach Dexter, CEO at LedgerX, said that, initially, the index will just be a reference for digital asset traders.

LedgerX and T3, a research-focused financial indexing company, specializing in volatility and option benchmarking, are planning to commercialize the index, which is subject to regulatory approval. If approved, the BTC volatility index would be tradable in a manner that’s somewhat similar to Wall Street’s VIX index.

The LedgerX team noted on July 10, 2020 that their new BitVol Index has been developed with assistance from a Chicago-headquartered options venue and T3 Index, an established provider of options-based indices.

BitVol is somewhat similar to Wall Street’s market fear gauge, the VIX, in that it aims to measure the 30-day implied volatility of Bitcoin (BTC), by analyzing LedgerX’s cryptocurrency market data.

Notably, this is not the first time that LedgerX has tried to launch a BTV volatility index. Last year, the company introduced the LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX). However, Dexter noted that the newly proposed index will be created by obtaining data from several different sources.

The new BTC volatility index may be viewed on LedgerX’s platform, and will also be available on Refinitiv‘s Eikon, a competitor to Bloomberg terminals. Options traders may use LedgerX’s BTC volatility index to assist them while they conduct trades. For example, the index may be used to help with buying calls if they see a drop in BTC volatility. Call options become a lot cheaper when volatility of the underlying asset drops.

Although LedgerX has managed to acquire a significant share of the relatively small crypto derivatives market, it is still well behind some of the larger players like BitMEX, CME Group, OKEx, and Deribit.

Subject to regulatory approval, T3 and LedgerX might “commercialize” the BTC volatility index, which means that they could develop a tradable product on top of the index. If it is launched, then it would reportedly be the first of its kind in the global BTC markets.

Traders have increasingly been using Wall Street’s VIX and have been exploring various strategies involving market volatility, according to a June 2020 report from The Wall Street Journal.

Chinese authorities have seized cryptocurrencies worth about $15 million while bringing down a scam involving fake Huobi tokens. In addition, ten people were arrested while luxury cars and real estate were confiscated.

The police in the Chinese city of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, have cracked a criminal case and seized millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, local media reported Thursday, calling the case the country’s “first criminal case involving smart contracts.”

The authorities began investigating the case after receiving a complaint in April from Li, a Chinese citizen who joined a Telegram group called “Huobi Global HT [huobi token] Arbitrage Chinese Community.” The group provided tutorials on an investment scheme that group members claim to be profitable. Li explained to the police:

Simply put … transfer your ETH (ethereum) to the account designated by the other party, and the other party will return 60 HT (huobi). After exchanging, the HT value added part is the money you make, the profit is around 8%.

The price of HT on July 3 was 28.61 yuan ($4) and the price of ETH was 1,589 yuan ($227), which should translate to a profit of about 8%, according to the report. However, when Li transferred his 10 ETH, worth 12,000 yuan ($1,714), to the account provided by the group owner, the other party returned 600 fake HT coins that could not be traded, Li claimed. That was when he realized that he had been scammed and reported it to the police.

After receiving Li’s complaint, the police launched an investigation into the scheme. They found that the group had more than 13,000 members. However, more than 10,000 accounts were idle “zombie accounts” and the remaining members and staff were actually computer bots. The report further notes, “There are only a few administrator accounts that are actually online, and their task is to publish tutorials to lure victims to be fooled.”

The arrests and confiscation were made after a month of investigation. The police say that this scam has swindled over 100 million yuan from more than 1,300 victims. The report elaborates:

[The police] successfully captured all 10 suspects … confiscated dozens of mobile phones and computers on the scene, seized tens of thousands of virtual currencies such as ETH, BTC, USDT, etc.

The police also seized real estate and luxury cars, such as a Mclaren and a Ferrari, worth more than 13 million yuan. The accused reportedly confessed to the crime after they were arrested.

Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, whose coin was the subject of the scam, had previously warned about a similar scheme promoted by a Telegram group called “Huobi Global official risk-free arbitrage group.” The company emphasized at the time that the HT coins sent by the scammers were fake and it had never launched a “risk-free arbitrage” campaign.

Ethereum’s DeFi boom

Why are more people turning to Ethereum than Bitcoin? One obvious answer—Ethereum is home to the top decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The rise of DeFi apps on Ethereum drove the blockchain’s total number of unique addresses to over 100 million by early June. A July report from Dapp.com estimated that DeFi applications accounted for over 97% of all Dapp volume on Ethereum.

The 100 million figure accounts for every unique address used in a transaction on Ethereum—both senders and recipients. This, obviously, doesn’t account for users who use multiple addresses, and so doesn’t entirely reflect the growth of Ethereum’s user base.

However, data from Bitinfocharts tracks transactions that go either from or to unique Ethereum addresses. Seen below, unique active Ethereum addresses rose 160% since January 1, climbing from 208,392, to 542,458 at time of writing.

More conservative data from Bitinfocharts also shows ETH addresses growing rapidly. Image: Bitinfocharts

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s unique active address count rose 42% in the same time, climbing from 585,047 on January 1 to 832,751 by July 10. This aligns closely with the data from Messari, and lends credence to the notion that Ethereum is currently experiencing a groundswell of renewed interest and activity.

Securities, Ponzis hog network resources

But while the rise of DeFi has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in unique Ethereum addresses, another Ethereum-based Dapp could also be playing a major role.

As reported by Decrypt on July 5, Forsage, the most popular Dapp on activity by user count, was responsible for guzzling almost 13% of Ethereum’s gas. Gas is the “fuel” that runs Ethereum, and is used as a measurement of the price of performing computations on the network.

That means Forsage—which the Philippines SEC has denounced as an unregistered security—is hogging 13% of the entire Ethereum blockchain. The presence of a Russian Ponzi scheme known as MMM Global has also contributed to the hoarding of Ethereum’s computational power in recent times. These operations usually see funds transferred from address to address, adding to Ethereum’s total unique address count.

Today, Forsage accounts for 12.5% of Ethereum’s gas usage, according to Dune Analytics, while ETH Gas Station places the figure at 15.8%.

Either way, the presence of what Ethereum researcher and developer Philippe Castonguay told Decrypt were “inevitable and unstoppable” Ponzi schemes should also be considered when accounting for Ethereum’s increased usage.",2020-07-11 13:07:18,https://cryptobriefing.com/despite-crypto-bans-youtube-now-shows-scam-ads-asking-users-send-bitcoin/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

YouTubers have reported seeing fake BTC giveaway ads pop up while watching content on the streaming platform. Many users, especially those in the crypto community, are angry and confused as to how YouTube would let this happen.

YouTube Scam Asks Viewers to Send Bitcoin

When users click on a video, they are instead greeted by a cumbersome advertisement to send Bitcoin for an instant 2x return.

At the time of writing, users have reported four types of ads featuring a variety of prominent celebrities in crypto and beyond, such as Changpeng Zhao of Binance, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak, and podcast host Joe Rogan.

The design of the ads is similar, suggesting they’ve been created by the same person or group of people.

According to some users, these advertisements have been going on for weeks. A user on Reddit wrote:

“I’ve been seeing 3 to 5 live videos, mostly faking Gemini’s identity, pop up every. single. day for over a week. I’ve been reporting it but it seems totally useless when it takes YT 10+ min to remove those live. Maybe Gemini should get involved?”

These blatant scams come amidst sweeping censorship of a variety of different crypto educational channels.

Are you kidding me @YouTube ?! You are allowing PAID crypto giveaway pre-roll Ads ?!You hyprocrits banned honest bitcoin educator channels before, BUT you allow PAID PRE-ROLL ADS of scams ?!I have seen these scams before served in the algorithm when searching BUT never PAID Ads ! pic.twitter.com/vWcpEPNaVM — Bitcoin Meme Hub 🔞 (@BitcoinMemeHub) July 11, 2020

Crypto Twitter has been vocal on the matter, blaming YouTube for hypocrisy in response to the systematic banning of crypto content creators over the past six months.",2020-07-11 15:49:23+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/comparing-apple-to-bitcoin-crypto-occupies-a-class-of-its-own,"A recent article by a Cointelegraph Markets contributor proclaimed that “Bitcoin is the ‘new’ Apple,” explaining just how Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could reach $60,000 by 2023: “Bitcoin hangs near the chasm of the adoption curve, and its price looks similar to Apple’s stock in 2008 before it broke out with a 520% rally.”

The technology adoption curve referenced was Everett Rogers’ famous “diffusion of innovations” model, published in 1962, which described the five stages through which technology becomes “diffused” — i.e., goes mainstream: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards.

In 2008, manufacturer Apple’s United States smartphone penetration was stalled at about 11% and still waiting to cross the “chasm,” the gap between the “early adopter” stage and the “early majority” stages in the Rogers lexicon. Any technical innovation worth its salt needs to cross that threshold. Apple’s smartphone surmounted that chasm, of course: Usage exploded, and Apple’s share price soared into the ionosphere. Bitcoin may well be in a similar place today.

But this comparison, satisfying as it may be, raises some questions. Is BTC even a technology — like radios, PCs, and smartphones — or is it something different: unique, sui generis — i.e., in a class by itself? Is BTC’s global penetration really anywhere close to 11% — its putative U.S. penetration rate? Also, while smartphone usage indubitably crossed the chasm more than a decade ago, how does one extrapolate BTC’s future price from AAPL’s share price? Shouldn’t it be compared with smartphones’ price?

The resemblance between Bitcoin and Apple in terms of growth and adoption is indeed there, but in short, is it fair to compare Bitcoin to younger versions of tech giants like Apple?

Not so simple

Arvind Singhal, a professor of communication at the University of Texas at El Paso, whose academic research has focused on the diffusion of innovation, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin did indeed seem singular: “It has tremendous barriers to adoption for most individuals and operates in a space of multiple familiar currencies — and that peculiarity would greatly influence its adoption.”

Michel Rauchs, the head of Paradigma — a consulting firm focusing on the digital assets sector — and a former research affiliate for the cryptocurrency and blockchain research program at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge, told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin is not a technology in itself, and any comparison [with traditional technologies] is misguided.” He added: “It is a social/economic system,” a new monetary order that uses technology to represent its unit of accounts. “Technology is just a secondary component, a means to an end.”

Additionally, it may be important here to separate Bitcoin from the more generalized blockchain technology in which it partakes — or risk misapplying Rogers’s diffusion of innovation theory — suggested Theophanis Stratopoulos, PwC Chair Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Accounting and Finance, who further explained to Cointelegraph:

“When decision-makers consider whether to implement blockchain — in, let’s say, their supply chain — they develop expectations in terms of the cost of making the investment — e.g., paying for the implementation of the software — versus the benefits, such as increased revenues or cost savings. It is the difference in expectations among decision-makers that explains the adoption cycle that was observed by Rogers.”

But Bitcoin does not behave the same way as other technologies typically adopted by firms — like CRM systems, for instance. “When it comes to Bitcoin, it’s the expected price that drives people to ‘invest’ in Bitcoin.” It is a matter of speculation, Stratopoulos continued, closer to a pyramid scheme than a capital expenditure. “If I believe that more people will want to hold Bitcoin in the future, the price of the Bitcoin will rise. In a case like this, it makes sense for me to ‘invest’ today rather than tomorrow.”

A paradox: More users, less efficiency

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, the CEO and founder of the BCB Group — a digital assets financial services group — agreed that BTC’s adoption cycle was anomalous, telling Cointelegraph: “The reason Bitcoin’s adoption path has broken formation with established adoption curves is quite technical: In the short term, the more users there are, the less useful it is as a currency.”

With more users, the Bitcoin network “self-regulates by raising the network fees as the mem pool bulges up in busy periods and breathes out in quieter ones.” But this makes Bitcoin less effective as a payments processing system. As von Landsberg-Sadie explained: “When fees are high, no one is going to pay a $5 transaction fee on a $5 coffee.”

Many technical solutions have been proposed to solve this dilemma, some in the form of forks, others like the Lightning Network project that makes use of a second layer, “but none have truly stuck in the core Bitcoin protocol, which has been the slowest to evolve.” The good news is that it is evolving, and the increase in off-chain transactions is reducing barriers, but all of this means one can’t expect Bitcoin to follow a classic Rogers technical adoption curve, according to von Landsberg-Sadie.

Price volatility in 2008 and 2020

When U.S. smartphone penetration stalled at around the 11% mark in December 2008, Apple’s share price became volatile — three-month volatility stood at 92%, according to the July 6 Cointelegraph article. In June 2020, with BTC penetration at 11%, three-month volatility was at 64%, indeed also a very high figure.

But Stratopoulos was unimpressed. “I would not compare Bitcoin to the performance of Apple or Amazon or any other high-tech company. Rogers’s adoption cycle applies to innovations — emerging technologies — not to the price of stock.” Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University in the United Kingdom, agreed, telling Cointelegraph:

“Since BTC is a form of product, then the natural comparison is with Apple’s smartphone product. Apple’s share price might have risen strongly, but the better comparison is with the price of smartphones, which have not.”

“It is relatively easy to find correlations” — like between AAPL in 2008 and BTC in 2020, commented Stratopoulos. “It does not mean that there is causation,” or it could be just a spurious correlation.

What stage is Bitcoin at?

What, then, can be said about Bitcoin adoption? If measured by awareness — e.g., recognition of the term Bitcoin — “then it has already entered the mainstream,” said Rauchs. A Blockchain Capital survey reported 89% awareness of Bitcoin in the U.S. as of Spring 2019. A U.K. Financial Conduct Authority survey conducted in December 2019, which was recently published, found that 73% have heard about crypto, compared to 58% in 2019.

As for BTC ownership, the Blockchain Capital survey reported: “In total, 9% of the [U.S] population owns Bitcoin — including 18% of those aged 18–34 and 12% of those aged 35–44.” The firm originally reported 11% but that was later corrected. In the U.K. survey, by comparison, an estimated “3.86% of the general population currently own cryptocurrencies.” This projects to approximately 1.9 million adults within the U.K. population (over 18) of roughly 50 million.

Rauchs finds the lower U.K. adoption estimate “more realistic” if generalizing; that is, he would peg crypto ownership at 3%–5% of the global population, which also includes indirect ownership — e.g., individuals participating in a pension fund that invests in Bitcoin. But this clearly means that all crypto is in the first half of the early adopter stage — nowhere near the so-called chasm.

It’s not much different for blockchain technology. Stratopoulos co-authored a paper on blockchain technology adoption — exclusive of cryptocurrencies — that concluded: “Despite the recent hype, the current adoption rate is relatively low, and blockchain has not become mainstream yet.”

Different applications, different adoption scenarios

Bitcoin clearly means different things to different people. “It’s most popular use today is as a store of value, while back in 2011, its principal use was as a payment method — for gaming” and other purposes, said Rauchs. Depending on its applications, different adoption curve scenarios are possible. For his part, Rauchs believes that BTC’s most likely future usage will be as an alternative, non-sovereign store of value.

According to von Landsberg-Sadie, Bitcoin’s true adoption pattern will be “more like a wave, oscillating higher at each cycle.” In this view, “the biggest bets are on the most extreme outcomes: Bitcoin will either ripple slowly out of relevance, or it will amplify meaningfully into the mainstream. My money is on the latter.”

In sum, BTC following the same growth pattern as Apple sounds like a fun version of what may happen, but ultimately, one shouldn’t quibble that it is “not based on a statistically valid experiment,” as Dowd reminded Cointelegraph. Still, according to several experts, it doesn’t make sense to compare Bitcoin to traditional technologies “because Bitcoin does not have the ability to create value — either in the form of increasing revenues or reducing costs,” as Stratopoulous noted. Moreover, global BTC penetration is arguably closer to 4% than to the 11% mark where smartphones stood in 2008, immediately before they went mainstream.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/zimbabwes-battle-to-control-currency-inadvertently-boosts-bitcoin-profile/,"Zimbabwe’s Battle To Control Currency Inadvertently Boosts Bitcoin Profile

Zimbabwe’s deteriorating economic situation is forcing authorities to sign off on some desperate and controversial decisions. This includes the abrupt suspension of mobile money in the country as well as the recent designation of Zimswitch as a mandatory national payment switch.

Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Suspends Mobile Money Service

Owned by banks, Zimswitch is the current payments switch to the same financial institutions. This designation has been made to, ostensibly, enable interoperability between financial services providers.

In a notice to the public Thursday, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) says all financial services providers including mobile money operators (MMO) must connect to this national payment switch.

The country’s largest MMO, Ecocash appears to be the target of this move by RBZ. Over the years, Ecocash has routinely been accused of frustrating efforts to enable interoperability between MMOs among a slew of charges.

Fighting Mobile Money Monopoly

Ecocash’s critics say the MMO does this to preserve its monopoly, a status it gained after investing heavily in building its infrastructure. Ecocash inevitably became the most dominant MMO, a fact confirmed by findings of a survey conducted by the local telecoms regulator. According to the findings, Ecocash accounts for more than 94% of all mobile money payments.

Furthermore, a study by the RBZ itself, reveals that mobile money dominates national retail payments, accounting for 80% of all such payments.

Inevitably, Ecocash’s dominant position has long been a source of tension with regulators and now government. Yet despite the threats and directives, Ecocash has steadfastly refused to be cowed into relinquishing its dominant position.

However, the country’s accelerated economic decline, as well as the hyperinflation environment, is reportedly creating tension and paranoia in corridors of power. Some commentators point the surprising decision to suspend mobile money transactions as an example of this paranoia.

As expected, Ecocash dared the government by refusing to abide by the suspension order. Ecocash argued that the government official making announcement erred as he did not consult with the RBZ before going public. The shortlived stand-off ended when the RBZ finally issued a statement wherein it regurgitates the government position.

Ecocash: Zimbabwe’s Economic Bogeyman

Now both government and RBZ sing from the same hymn book when it comes Ecocash. They accuse Ecocash of fueling activities on the “illegal” foreign currency black market. Ecocash is also accused of running a Ponzi scheme. Somehow, Ecocash has become the Zimbabwe economy’s bogeyman.

The designation of Zimswitch as the payments switch for all financial services providers appears to show a determination by authorities to check Ecocash’s influence. By gaining indirect control of the popular MMO, authorities hope they will also be able to rein in influential foreign currency dealers.

Ultimately, killing the black market for foreign currency appears to be the objective. However, it is doubtful if this objective can be realised through the use of such heavy-handed tactics.

Ecocash may be out of legal options to fight back this time but that may not be the case for shadowy foreign currency dealers. Dealers and now ordinary citizens seem to have found another option that does not include Ecocash. This option is bitcoin.

Faced with stringent foreign exchange regulations some Zimbabweans are switching to bitcoin when making payments across borders. Bitcoin is faster and not subject to normal regulations.

The Growing Use of Bitcoin

Still, others now prefer storing their funds in the form of bitcoin because they have absolute control. The government cannot control or suspend cryptocurrency as it has done with Ecocash. Bitcoin is also immune to local inflation which, according to John Hopkins Economics professor, Steve Hanke, now exceeds 1000% per annum.

Some foreign nationals are now also using bitcoin when remitting funds back to their home countries. Finally, joining this crypto community is the much-maligned foreign currency traders. Traders are tapping into the growing demand for bitcoin.

In 2018, perhaps sensing a threat posed by cryptocurrencies, the RBZ directed banks to end support for all cryptocurrency-related businesses. This directive resulted in the shut down of Golix, a cryptocurrency exchange. Yet, in spite of all this, bitcoin trading and its use as means of payment continues to grow.

Traders and buyers of bitcoin now use social media messaging apps and other channels to initiate transactions.

Unfortunately for the government and RBZ, they are not positioned to determine the exact level of bitcoin trading or penetration. This is partly due to the directive against the only formal institutions that can generate such data. The order that outlaws cryptocurrency exchanges remain in force. Furthermore, the peer to peer nature and anonymity of transactions means authorities will never know the true volumes of transactions.

Social Media Messaging Apps as Cryptocurrency Exchange Platforms

Nevertheless, there is still a way one can gain some insights into this trade. A simple perusal of posts or adverts found in many crypto related social media chat groups can provide clues.

In some of the posts seen by this writer, sellers offer amounts often not exceeding $100. With the restrictions and suspension of certain mobile money services, trades are now mainly settled in hard currency.

From the adverts, it’s customary for sellers of bitcoin to charge a premium ranging from 5% to 10%, in addition to the agreed price. In the meantime, many buyers are looking for bitcoin that exceeds $100.

Looking at a few media channels one trader stands out. The trader, who we shall not name, normally posts advertisements every morning. In the advertisements, she sets terms and conditions, usually the minimum bitcoin (BTC) they are selling and their premium rate.

Speaking to this writer, the trader says business has been booming as of late. She claims to now sell bitcoin worth $50,000 each day. She attributes this to the growing uncertainty and control of the economy by the government.

Zimbabwe’s growing bitcoin trading activities suggest authorities may be losing the battle to win confidence and trust. It seems as conditions get worse more will seek to understand this newly found escape route.

Do you think more Zimbabweans will switch to bitcoin as the economic situation gets worse? Let us know in the comments section below

The ride-hailing application is integrating the digital yuan as a payment method, enabling citizens to use DRMB to pay for rides and potentially more in the future, according to the unnamed source.

The integration is led by the People’s Bank of China, together with Soft Bank to create what is being internally called the Digital Currency Electronic Payment virtual legal tender.

There is no official statement on when this system will become operational, and the PBOC did not answer to inquiries made by Bloomberg journalists.

The wide-spread acceptance of a blockchain-powered future for China started with Xi Jinping’s speech last year, and since then, the state has worked tirelessly to create the infrastructure for the digital yuan.

This move by the Chinese government is preceded by hypothetical simulations during their pilot program in April earlier this year. The goal of simulations was to provide Beijing with insights and estimate the level of control over the country’s financial system should it be implemented across the entire country. The pilot was limited to four major cities in China.

Details about countrywide implementation remain a mystery. However, we don’t expect to see fast results considering the USD 27 trillion payments industry in China. The rollout of the digital yuan is likely to happen in stages, similar to the current “Didi” test.

Didi is going to be the first real stress test for the blockchain network and will define the course of action for the Chinese government.",

Record Bitcoin options volumes are indicative of an increasing institutional interest in crypto, but there are better quantitative and qualitative indicators to use, such as open interest, Bitcoin’s price, frequency of block trades, institutional Know Your Customer processes and others.

Compared with traditional derivatives, the proportion of institutional investors in the entire pool is still small, but it is clear that the definitive rise in interest is driven by financial instruments such as options and futures. Options are not a panacea but rather a stage in the development of an asset, and as is evident, Bitcoin and Ether have both reached that point in their evolutions. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, echoed similar thoughts, stating that “the inflow of institutional investors money into crypto is still very nascent,” adding:

“There are however various indicators signaling the gradual adoption of crypto or BTC more specifically into institutional portfolios. Traditional finance tends to prefer traditional instruments like options and futures, volumes and open interest in those instruments are clear indicators of potential growing institutional demand.”

Volumes could be misleading

Considering only the reported volumes of Bitcoin and Ether could be misleading to investors and speculators alike, as derivatives volumes are often subject to being skewered by bots, wash trading and misreporting. A better volume indicator would be the amount of BTC moving in and out of derivatives exchanges such as Deribit. Such analytics are provided by several firms that extract insights from on-chain data.

After Bitcoin options volumes saw a 1,000% rise on CME in May, derivatives volumes dropped 35.7% in June to $393 billion. However, the total option volumes for Bitcoin options on CME once again set a new record monthly high, jumping 41% with 8,444 contracts traded. Cointelegraph confirmed this increase with a CME spokesperson who provided insight on the trending open interest of BTC options, stating: “In June, CME bitcoin options had 12 consecutive days of record OI, culminating with a record 9,858 contracts (49,290 equivalent bitcoin) on June 26.”

Open interest: A better indicator than volumes?

While increased volumes indicate rising interest in crypto from both the public and institutions that are trying to hedge against volatility and shelter assets during the COVID-19 pandemic and looming global financial crisis, open interest proves to be a better indicator of institutional interest, as it signifies buy-side interest and isn’t as flawed a metric to make this distinction as reported volumes would be. The spokesperson from CME agreed, saying:

“In our CME Bitcoin futures market, the number of large open interest holders (LOIHs), or traders holding 25 or more contracts, grew to an average of 65 LOIHs in Q2 2020. That’s a 27% increase from Q1 and a new record. Large open interest holders are large traders as defined by the CFTC, and therefore may be another indicator of institutional participation.”

Source: CME

Block trades

Block trades are privately negotiated futures/options contracts that meet certain quantity thresholds and are usually executed on the sidelines of the public auction market. As institutional investors and traders usually trade in higher ticket sizes, the percentage of block trades within the overall volume could also serve as an indicator of institutional interest in crypto. CME’s spokesperson further confirmed this hypothesis:

“Block trading of CME Bitcoin options has grown steadily since their January 2020 launch — blocks accounted for 79% of all CME Bitcoin options volume in June, compared to 22% in April. It’s worth noting that the minimum block trade size for both CME Bitcoin futures and options is 5 contracts (equivalent to 25 Bitcoin). So increased block trading could be indicative of increased institutional participation.”

To understand more about the phenomenon of block trades among crypto-exclusive exchanges, it is important to consider Deribit, as it’s the biggest platform for these instruments. In June, the biggest quarterly expiration date yet occurred, with 115,000 contracts expiring, of which Derebit maintained 74,000. Deribit’s Strijers further elaborated on the relevance of open interest and block trades, revealing:

“Total BTC options market open interest was just below USD 2 billion, another record and confirmation of client interest in the asset class. We also see an increase in the relative number of BTC option block trades from 6–8% on average per month to almost 12% of the June 2020 volume.”

BTC’s price and its volatility

By the end of the second quarter, BTC volatility had been markedly dampened, which in itself is a lucrative sign for institutional involvement due to institutions’ preference for stability. By comparison, retail-driven markets often see wild swings. According to Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx — a Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange — stability is a sign that “Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class,” adding in a conversation with Cointelegraph:

“When institutional traders started becoming interested in BTC, volatility was a red flag that kept many away. Yet, with today’s panorama, we are seeing more volatility currently in traditional markets. This could be another reason behind the new interest from traders wanting to diversify their portfolios and finally seeing Bitcoin as a viable option for a hedge at last with a sophisticated derivatives market and options trading.”

It’s important to note that the reduced volatility of Bitcoin’s price alone is not enough to draw conclusions regarding levels of institutional involvement. John Todaro, head of research at TradeBlock — one of the largest digital currency platforms for trade executions — told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin has had levels of dampened volatility in the past before resuming wild market swings—2018 is a good year to see this. As such, reduced volatility alone would not indicate institutional involvement.”

In the recent past, Bitcoin’s price has shown a correlation with the S&P 500, which can be taken as a representative index for the global equities market. Todaro further explained on what this entails for institutional interest:

“The moderate to strong correlation between equities and Bitcoin the past several months has been a good example of rising institutional interest. Large trading firms tend to push assets into directions of positive or negative correlation, which we have seen recently between Bitcoin and equities. In the past, Bitcoin has behaved very non-correlated, almost indicating a complete divorce from traditional financial markets.”

Bitcoin ETF

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are derivatives products that are traded using Bitcoin as their underlying assets, either fully or partially. Once the Securities and Exchange Commission approves Bitcoin ETFs, they are expected to become huge, being a watershed moment in the life cycle of BTC as an asset class and likely boosting retail demand and penetration, as revealed by Todaro: “A Bitcoin ETF in my opinion would actually increase retail trading activity given ETFs themselves are often geared for more retail like traders as a simple exposure opportunity.”

Not only would this bring more retail investors in the fold, but it would also be an incentive for institutions to engage with an investment vehicle that they are very familiar with — with the SEC’s seal of approval easing institutional concerns about exposing their clients to unregulated markets. OKEx’s Hao elaborated on this:

“Everyone in the space has long been awaiting the approval of a Bitcoin ETF as this will certainly increase demand from institutions as they can gain exposure for their clients to bitcoin without having to own it or deal with exchanges. They can greatly diversify their holdings without exposure to many of the risks that trading and owning BTC implies.”

Giants are beginning to surface

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has become a force to reckon with, managing record amounts of funds and with institutions comprising 88% of its investors. Beyond this, traditional players such as the Big Four accounting firms are jumping into the crypto market, and even Western Union is making a bet. This change is also traceable on platforms such as TradeBlock, as Todaro further explained: “We have seen a considerable amount of interest from new and existing institutional traders/investment firms as they scale up in the crypto space.”

Strijers confirmed that this interest is being seen in Deribit as well. While the company does track its institutional KYC metrics, it does not publicly publish that information. Strijers went on to say, “The number of corporate entities we service keeps growing month on month, as well as the variety of new requests received to specifically develop services for funds or discretionary asset managers.”

The latest news that PayPal may allow Bitcoin payments further lends credibility to the space. And with a robust and vibrant derivatives market, plus the unprecedented uncertainty in traditional markets, this interest is likely to only grow.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-scammers-used-btc-gemini-exchange-to-siphon-millions,"The two Nigerians jetsetters who filled their Instagram accounts with pictures of their ostentatious wealth were extradited from Dubai to the United States. According to the FBI, they were able to convert millions of dollars into Bitcoin (BTC) via the Gemini exchange.

The two are Olalekan Jacob Ponle, also known as “Mr. Woodbery,” and “Mark Kain,” and Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, who used the aliases “Ray Hushpuppi” and “Hush”. The FBI complaint focused on the former’s activities and how he used Bitcoin to transfer the stolen funds.

Business email compromise — 1,500 BTC

According to the FBI, Ponle along with his accomplices was engaging in a scheme known as business email compromise or BEC. A criminal would gain access to a legitimate business email account and then manipulate the company’s employees into transferring company funds to the criminal’s bank account. The complaint alleges that Ponle and his accomplices defrauded American companies of tens of millions of dollars while converting $6.5 million into 1,500 BTC:

“Preliminary blockchain analysis indicates that PONLE received at least 1,494.71506296 bitcoin related to these BEC schemes, valued at approximately $6,599,499.98 at the time he received the proceeds.”

The complaint said it is clear that Ponle was not terribly concerned with covering his tracks on the Bitcoin network as he has been using the same address (16AtGJbaxL2kmzx4mW5ocpT2ysTWxmacWn) since 2014, though the complaint focuses on his illicit activity throughout 2019 only.

Gemini Exchange

Gemini was the criminals' favorite exchange. This may seem surprising, considering that the exchange is considered one of the most compliant in the industry. However, this choice can probably be explained by the fact the accused needed a U.S.-based exchange that caters to businesses.

On Feb. 15, 2019, Ponle’s associate confirmed that $2,149,000 had been successfully deposited to Gemini and converted to BTC.

Another transaction took place on Jan. 17, 2019 when Ponle’s accomplice converted $119,000 into 33.13 BTC — in the FBI complaint, it mistakenly says 3.13 instead. This transaction originated from an unidentified address, but it is one hop away from another American exchange — Kraken. Although the latter is not mentioned in the complaint.

In July, the FBI was able to infiltrate Ponle’s inner circle when an agent began communicating with Ponle online using the same handle that was previously used by one of his associates. On Sept. 9, 2019, a discussion between Ponle and his associate about converting $5 million to Bitcoin took place.

Unbeknown to Ponle, this time it was an FBI agent at the other end of the chat. Although the complaint does not specify it, this transaction presumably never happened as no associated transaction can be identified with the “16AtGJ BTC Wallet.”

Cashing Out Via LocalBitcoin & Huobi

Whereas Gemini was the exchange of choice for converting stolen fiat into Bitcoin, LocalBitcoins and Huobi were preferable choices for cashing out. According to Crystal Blockchain, 577 BTC was cleared via the former and 539 BTC via the latter. Both have been criticized for lax KYC procedures in the past.

Ponle and his colleague Abbas lived a life of ostentatious wealth, parading their newly acquired fortunes on Instagram. In one of his last posts, Ponle admonished his followers against the guilt associated with wealth:

“YOU ARE WORTH THE PLEASURES OF YOUR LABOR 💙 Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you’ve acquired, especially when you paid in blood, sweat and tears, to have the things that are deemed “ un-purchase-able”.”

Now the court will determine his guilt.

Gemini declined to comment on the situation, although their spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the exchange is using Chainalysis to monitor risks.

The FBI declined Cointelegraph’s request for comment.",,https://www.coindesk.com/hyper-stablecoinization-from-eurodollars-to-crypto-dollars,"Tribal fighting between Bitcoiners and Ethereans is unabated. Bitcoin is understood as “money crypto,” while Ethereum is labeled “tech crypto.” Bitcoin is sound money that will make all other monies obsolete. Ethereum, on the other hand, is seen as better tech that will update Wall Street’s settlement layer. The conflict is incomprehensible to outsiders, and each community says the other has not understood the crypto world’s actual goal and ethos.

You could imagine this conflict going on for years, a sort of “Game of Thrones” for blockchain. But there’s another, more hopeful, way of imagining the future. Conceivably, the future will be one where Bitcoin and Ethereum gain greater relevance alongside each other (as Michael Casey argued in his recent column). Both “money crypto” and “tech crypto” will play their roles. It might just not be in the pure sense envisioned by either of the two maximalist groups.

Dollar shackles

We are currently under a crushing dollar yoke. Back in the 19th century, many parts of the world had free banking. Banks were granted unrestricted competitive issuance of currency and deposit money on a convertible basis. But gradually the paradigm of free banking faded away and state-orchestrated fiat currency took hold.

After World War II, much of the world started trading in dollars, making it into a reserve currency. To this day, U.S. Treasurys provide a safe haven in times of financial turmoil, tightening the dollar’s grip on global finance.

Greater dependence on the dollar means greater dependence on the Federal Reserve. As a national bank, the Fed puts national interests first. These oftentimes contradict with other countries’ concerns, leaving them in a tight spot.

As the world has been dollarizing, a paradox has emerged: Although the U.S. central bank is often criticized for inflating its currency, global markets deem the available amount of dollar liquidity to be insufficient. This lack of liquidity has caused financial actors all around the world to start helping themselves.

Eurodollars needed

The world, especially emerging market economies, really needs dollars. The emergence of the eurodollar system in the 1960s was a direct consequence of the Fed not being able to supply the world’s relentless need for extra dollars.

Eurodollars are U.S. dollar accounting entries that are used to settle cash flows between numerous players outside the banking system supervised by the Fed. As such, eurodollars are not subject to U.S. banking regulations. As the economist Milton Friedman pointed out in 1969, eurodollars are created by the bookkeeper’s pen.

Corporations, banks and other international actors are dependent on dealer markets providing enough eurodollar funding to uphold market liquidity and service debt. These private dealers are acting primarily through the shadow banking system. Because the dollar has ascended to become the world’s number one currency with the deepest and most liquid capital market, people all around the globe have been going into dollar debt. There is nearly $60 trillion in dollar-denominated debt globally and immense demand to service dollar debt.

The crypto-dollar system is more transparent than the old euro dollar system based on shadow banking (so named for a reason).

Eurodollars are the world’s way to grapple with recurring short squeezes in the dollar, a global dollar shortage that manifests itself each time with ever greater severity.

But eurodollars are not actual dollars. They are offshore dollars or could be seen as dollar approximations. In times of crises this becomes evident as financial market actors strive to acquire actual dollars. With every crisis, the Fed also has to pump more dollars into the system, only to nourish the ground for a future crisis. As ongoing turbulence in the repo market and the broader shadow banking system show, the Fed’s actions seem only temporarily to soothe appetite for more and more dollars.

Higher demand for dollars will also imply further depreciation of local currencies against the greenback, especially in emerging markets. The most current example of this is Lebanon, where the local currency has lost at least 50% of its value against the dollar this year. Greater capital controls in these types of markets could well be in store, which would make it harder for debtors to obtain dollars or eurodollars for that matter.

Enter public blockchains

In times like these, public blockchains with a liability-free native asset can act as neutral settlement networks independent of the financial system. The stage is set for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used as vehicles to alleviate the world’s global dollar shortage.

For example, U.S. dollar stablecoins – so-called crypto dollars running on Bitcoin and Ethereum – are a way to get dollar exposure or dollar proxies. As natively digital bearer instruments with transparent and efficient auditability capacities, crypto dollars are easy to accept and can be traded 24/7/365 with virtually no downtime. They also help circumvent emerging capital controls on traditional finance and eurodollar paths.

The eurodollar approach was an attempt by private actors to create a dollar funding system outside the U.S., but still within the traditional financial system. Crypto dollars mainly reside outside of the traditional, U.S.-led financial system. Because of its inherent auditability, the crypto-dollar system is more transparent than the old euro dollar system based on shadow banking (so named for a reason).

Upgrade for the Eurodollar

We’re beginning to see the dollarization of public blockchains. Since March, the value of USD-pegged stablecoins has passed $11 billion. Tether could surpass the market cap of Ethereum or even Bitcoin due to growing demand for synthetic dollars and its approximations.

Hyper-stablecoinization will be the upgrade for eurodollar banking. It will once again be private individuals using the innovative tools at their hands to make sure they can get the dollar exposure they need. But this time the tools are public blockchains and cryptographic tokens.

The shadow banking system is a way for private actors to pledge collateral to create synthetic dollar funds and approximations. But the crypto world in conjunction with the programmability of public blockchains will take this one step further. Bitcoin and ETH already serve as collateral to create dollar deposits and dollar credit instruments.",2020-07-12 12:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-tiktok-crypto-market-manipulation-coinbase-ipo,"This week saw a 125% rise in the price of dogecoin, a cryptocurrency based on a popular 2013 internet meme, created in the same year as both a parody and a “let’s see if this sticks” experiment. Much to even the founder’s surprise, it has not only survived, it has accumulated a loyal following. Clearly.

A group of teenagers on the extremely popular but recently beleaguered social platform TikTok decided to use their voice and audience to move the price of dogecoin up. It has nothing to do with fundamentals, potential or even government handouts – most participants probably don’t even understand what cryptocurrency is (many of the videos refer to DOGE as a “stock”). It’s about manipulation, just because.

Why is this relevant? Because it is an irresistibly fluffy yet alarming symptom that trust is fundamentally broken in markets.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

When you have the next generation of investors blatantly flaunting that markets are a meaningless casino, when you have them advertising that markets can be manipulated, then you do have to wonder what role markets will have in their lives as they get older.

Nice to have celebrity endorsers...

And much like the day traders picking stocks from a bag of Scrabble tiles, this does raise questions about the role of facts in our interpretation of value.

When markets don’t make any sense, when fundamentals no longer seem to matter, it becomes clear the rules are being rewritten or even thrown out the window. We could be in the creative destruction phase that will give way to a new wave of innovation. And in that wave, new types of assets could have a respectable place in new types of portfolios.

Meanwhile, however, the untethered nature of current price logic is disconcerting, and a reminder that creative destruction can be vicious to those caught in the transition. Uncertainty is not good for trust, and a lack of trust is not good for progress.

So, while I can chuckle with glee at the adorable takes that I can’t resist sharing with you here…

Or is it a ""pack chain""?

…I’m also wondering what will have changed most in markets two to three years from now. Maybe sanity will have been restored. Or maybe this is sane in comparison to what’s coming.

A Coinbase listing would not necessarily be good for the market

We can’t not talk about the unconfirmed rumors that Coinbase is planning a stock market listing. These rumors are not new, but they have suddenly taken on a renewed relevance. Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the plans, citing sources familiar with the matter. And Coinbase has called an investor meeting, sparking speculation as to why.

Should this happen, it would be a big deal for the cryptocurrency industry, but not necessarily the boost many seem to think.

It would be a big deal for three main reasons:

1) It would focus a lot of mainstream attention on the industry as a whole, as financial reporters throw around the word “crytpo,” as equity analysts scramble to produce reports and as investors are taken aback by the sheer numbers at play in these relatively overlooked markets.

2) We the public would finally get detailed insight into the inner workings and accounts of one of the industry’s most prominent businesses (as an analyst, I’m really looking forward to that).

3) It would provide a listed and liquid opportunity for investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrencies. This could put crypto, albeit indirectly, within reach of any investor, retail or institutional, and possibly give it a home in pension funds, exchange-traded funds, 401(k)s, etc.

How would this boost the cryptocurrency markets?

Increased mainstream attention could encourage more people to learn about cryptocurrency fundamentals, and possibly trigger a wave of new investment.

Also, new funding from an initial public offering could mean further growth for Coinbase through a broader reach or a more extensive service.

Now here is where the “buts” come in.

Rather than an IPO, the move could merely represent a handsome exit for the initial investors through a direct listing. Even if so, however, it would set up a pipeline for further financing, which could influence growth further down the road.

And, this is even more important, a public listing of a significant company such as Coinbase would not necessarily encourage mainstream crypto exposure. Investment would be going into a company, not the cryptocurrency market. True, the investment in that private company could encourage more investment in the cryptocurrency market further down the line, but the effect would not be linear.

It could even be a self-defeating proposition. Investors en masse could choose to buy shares in Coinbase instead of buying cryptocurrency directly, which ironically could end up hurting Coinbase’s prospects.

Ok, that’s an extreme extension of the theory, but it’s not totally out of the question.

The net effect of a Coinbase listing, or any other significant cryptocurrency business heading to the frothy stock markets, could be net positive for crypto assets. But it may not be the investment trigger many are hoping for.

Hashrate highs

Bitcoin’s hashrate has hit an all-time seven-day moving average high, less than two months after a miner reward halving led to a 40% drop as unprofitable mining equipment was switched off. The hashrate metric is significant in that it is a proxy for network security – the higher the hashrate, the more computational power is spent on validating transactions and maintaining the network.

Hashrate peaks don't trigger price increases Source: Coin Metrics

So, the hashrate reaching all-time seven-day average highs is being taken as a bullish signal by some. But the numbers don’t bear that theory out.

Hashrate peaks are often followed by price slumps Source: Coin Metrics

As we can see, usually after a hashrate peak, both price and hashrate fall over a seven-day and 30-day timeframe. But not always. So, hashrate is worth keeping an eye on, because a growing hashrate indicates growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s outlook. But it should not be used as a trading signal without a lot of caution and additional information.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

You’re probably all aware of how previously underused and reconfigured words and phrases have been given a new life with the current crisis. “Lockdown,” “social distancing,” not to mention “unprecedented”… And some new words are emerging. Here’s one: coronacoaster. I kid you not.

The market has been alternating between fits of euphoria and depression. With the highs higher than the lows, the net effect is up.

The main new factor that impacted the market over the last week was the sharp rise and fall in the Chinese market. While not a large market by U.S. standards, this rally underlines a significant difference in market influences. In the case of the U.S., part of the rally has been encouraged by likes of Davy Day Trader, pushing the retail frenzy to new highs. Whilst, in China, the stock market moves were largely from the government telling retail investors to buy. And then, to not buy.

The bitcoin market, meanwhile, has been … well … uninteresting in terms of price and volumes. Maybe a strong breakout is building, maybe not, and either way, who knows in which direction. Meanwhile the developments in the sector are galloping forward as you will see below in CHAIN LINKS, so the lack of notable market trends does not mean that we get to put down our pencils for a bit and take a breather. Unfortunately.

CHAIN LINKS

Los Angeles-based fund manager Arca has launched its Arca U.S. Treasury Fund, an SEC-registered closed-end fund that invests in U.S. T-bills and notes, and whose digital shares – ArCoins – move on the ethereum blockchain. TAKEAWAY: This is the first time the SEC has allowed a fund represented by blockchain-based tokens to trade under the 40 Act. Technically the fund’s shares will be crypto asset investments, although their value will be based on one of the most stable securities available: short-term U.S. government debt. This is fascinating because it could change the perception that markets and regulators have of crypto assets in general, and it could start to wake general capital markets up to alternative trading mechanisms. Whether this fund takes off or not, it is a pioneering step towards what could be the capital markets of tomorrow.

Kraken Futures, previously known as Crypto Facilities, has been granted a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority. TAKEAWAY: This makes Crypto Facilities the first licensed crypto derivatives platform for the European market, and we could soon see the launch of EUR-denominated crypto products.

The London Stock Exchange Group has added 169 digital assets to its SEDOL Masterfile service, a global database that assigns unique identifiers to financial instruments. This helps LSEG customers keep track of traded assets from execution to settlement. TAKEAWAY: This is not an official seal of “approval,” but it’s worth asking why they would do this if it’s not to include digital assets in their offering at some point in the future.

The CFTC, which regulates the U.S. bitcoin and ether derivatives markets, plans to develop a digital asset innovation blueprint by 2024. TAKEAWAY: That may sound like a long time in the future, but in terms of new regulatory frameworks, it’s actually not, and it does strongly suggest the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is already working on it. So, we can expect more investigation, communication and events from the world’s principal derivatives regulator over the coming months, which should hint at the stance global derivatives regulators around the world could take.

The CENTRE Consortium, which issues the dollar-pegged USDC on top of the ethereum blockchain, blacklisted a USDC address in response to a law enforcement request, freezing $100,000 worth of the stablecoin. TAKEAWAY: That this is even possible – the freezing of a cryptocurrency account – highlights the centralized nature of most fiat-backed stablecoins circulating today, and should reassure regulators that they are not necessarily going to lead to greater money laundering and financial crime. CENTRE’s cooperation with law enforcement, while anathema to original crypto libertarians, could also position it as a complement to the eventual digital dollar, should that come about. There will always be demand for monetary transfer systems with no seizure risk; but institutional participants need to stick to the regulated space, in which the seizure option is likely to be a requirement.

My colleague David Pan outlines the potential impact on crypto market infrastructure of Hong Kong’s national security law. TAKEAWAY: For instance, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act passed by the U.S. Senate this week in retaliation stipulates that the U.S. government should restrict foreign banks and subsidiaries of U.S. banks in Hong Kong from accessing the U.S. dollar system if they conduct significant transactions with China. That could increase market friction as it becomes harder for Hong Kong-based companies to access U.S. dollars. Hong Kong is a significant crypto market hub, so it remains to be seen if this will affect trading volumes. It’s also worth keeping an eye on stablecoin flows, as they could be a short-term workaround.

Ten-day realized volatility is at a two-year low, according to data from skew.com. The last time it was this low, it preceded a sharp price drop. This time, investors point to increased call buying as a sign the breakout might be on the upside. TAKEAWAY: That feeling when an absence of activity is news.

BTC realized volatility continues its trend down Source: skew.com

Continuing on the theme that not much is happening in the crypto markets, CryptoCompare’s monthly Exchange Report highlights the relative lack of spot and derivative volumes.

The fiat USD share of the BTC market is shrinking Source: CryptoCompare

Switzerland-based crypto lender Nexo is preparing to become a prime broker with help from oracle provider Chainlink, which will power audits to bring more transparency to Nexo’s operations. TAKEAWAY: Audited lending and borrowing would be good news for the industry, enhancing trust in the collateral and the yields. I am, however, beginning to sense the emergence of a buzzword (“prime broker”) that is starting to lose its original meaning.

Nic Carter and Matt Walsh of Castle Island Ventures wrote a compelling overview of the evolution of digital dollars, worth a read for anyone trying to keep up with what’s happening in stablecoins (fiat-backed as well as synthetic) and central bank digital currencies.

Stablecoin issuer Tether has blacklisted 40 Ethereum addresses holding millions of dollars of the tether cryptocurrency, 24 of which were banned this year. This finding follows the Centre Consortium taking a similar action due to a request by law enforcement.

Tether Frozen in 40 Addresses

Tether has banned 40 Ethereum addresses holding millions of dollars of the stablecoin USDT, according to an analysis by Ethereum researcher Philippe Castonguay who shared his findings on Dune Analytics. Banned addresses cannot receive or send the cryptocurrency.

The 40 addresses “have been banned from using USDT on Ethereum as of now,” Castonguay explained. According to the researcher, one address was frozen in 2017, eight in 2018, seven in 2019, and 24 in 2020 so far. At press time, the latest address on his list was banned on Friday.

“Tether routinely assists law enforcement in their investigations,” Stuart Hoegner, general counsel at Bitfinex, Tether’s sister company, told The Block. “Through the freeze address feature, Tether has been able to help users and exchanges to save and recover tens of millions of dollars stolen from them by hackers.” The publication added that its analysis shows that $5.51 million worth of USDT is held in addresses blacklisted this year.

Tether is not the only one freezing its coin. This week, the Centre Consortium blacklisted an address with $100,000 worth of the USDC stablecoin in response to a request from law enforcement. Castonguay made a similar Dune Analytics dashboard to keep track of addresses banned from using USDC, which so far only includes one address.

Meanwhile, the New York Supreme Court’s Appellate Division ruled on Thursday that State Attorney General Letitia James can continue her investigations into entities behind tether. Bitfinex and Tether are also involved in another ongoing lawsuit.

As of the writing of this article, Bitcoin stands at a little over $9,000, very close to the $10,000 rebound that investors hoped for sometime this year — and we are barely in the third quarter.

Although there are signs that crypto winter is over, many experts are still understandably cautious.

Related: What's Next for the Industry as 'Crypto Winter' Thaws?

Cryptocurrency has been a notoriously unstable investment, first selling at less than a penny and then varying from $400 to $1,242 between all of 2013 and 2016. In 2017, crypto investors were gleeful (and some, probably, quite smug) to see the currency reach the insane height of $4,400 and then end the year breaking an astonishing $20,000 — all this after plummeting to $2,000 that same September.

Of course, what followed that bright season in the cryptocurrency industry was what we refer to as crypto winter — the drastic drop in value following several high-profile Ponzi schemes, successful hacks, crypto-jacking attempts and overall negative media coverage.

In this article, we will discuss the question of whether crypto winter is over, whether those who have already invested have a reason to be hopeful, and whether those who haven’t should jump on the bandwagon soon before prices skyrocket. We will also place a focus on blockchain technology as it exists both inside and outside the cryptocurrency industry, and why widespread adoption of this new technology is an indicator of cryptocurrency’s future success.

Is crypto winter over?

For many of the experts, the answer seems to be “yes.” From crypto enthusiasts to Forbes, the current viewpoint of many is that Bitcoin is poised to make huge gains for the next 10 years. Although the vagaries of the cryptocurrency industry are as mysterious as Satoshi Nakamoto himself, it seems that we have headed into a period of stability during which the fundamentals of cryptocurrency are better understood and trusted.

Only 4% of Americans polled cite cryptocurrency as their preferred long-term investment, but this is very likely going to change in the near future, as Bitcoin has nothing but room to grow.

Many compare the future of Bitcoin to that of the internet, and claim that the commodity is going through the same growing pains of scalability, availability and ease of use that the internet first went through from 1995.

Similarly, market experts note that although only 11% of Americans own Bitcoin, those numbers are on par with other huge technological developments in their early stages, such as smartphones.

Many point out that the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak to traditional banking and investing institutions may be a motivator to invest in the digital currency to protect against inflation and the questionable resilience of fiat currencies.

Many experts also suggest that cryptocurrency transactions aren’t completely secure and anonymous without the use of a virtual private network, or VPN. They are also irreversible. Once a coin is gone from your account, it can easily vanish without a trace. Hackers have taken advantage of this by breaking into exchanges and stealing small amounts from each user.

So, it will likely take time until Bitcoin gains trust from the wider public, but for those willing to take a risk, it might be the most profitable investment of 2020, specifically for those who are willing to wait 10 years to witness the true extent of its growth.

Blockchain — The real winner behind cryptocurrency

Although much is left to be seen about the future of cryptocurrency, no one can deny that the idea of creating a digital-only currency is as old as science fiction. From transportation to food to medicine to video games, a wide variety of industries continue to look to blockchain technology for logistical and transactional solutions. In seven years, it is estimated that $300 billion worth of food products will be tracked using blockchain technology, saving over $100 billion annually.

In 2018, JPMorgan surprised the traditional financial world by publicly stating that blockchain technology is the way of the future for cross-border payments. A year after that, IBM, Citibank and Barclays announced the development of their own blockchain-based platforms, and Dubai made a statement that it has a new goal to become blockchain-powered by 2020.

Although this is still a relatively new technology, there is little doubt that blockchain and the cryptographic technology it uses will rapidly dominate the landscape in coming years. Countless top-tier engineers, product developers and designers are building real solutions on top of blockchain, working to perfect this technology for widespread use across various industries.

It is possible that we may have to wait until blockchain technology is fully understood, utilized and appreciated by the masses in order to provide cryptocurrency a much-needed publicity boost.

After all, although currencies and monetary investments like cryptocurrencies can go through wild ups and downs, there is nothing more stable than an already proven and reliable technological solution like blockchain.

Ready for some spring cleaning?

Many unanswered questions and problems that still exist are unsettling to cautious investors, but these obstacles bear resemblance to other successful, ground-breaking technologies such the internet and Apple smartphones. Furthermore, much of the negative press about the problems associated with Bitcoin is due to scams that could have been easily avoided with adequate financial knowledge and cybersecurity.

Also, let’s not forget that traditional banking institutions have a vested interest in making cryptocurrency seem like a questionable investment. Of course, big banks and traditional investing platforms have significant power to fund research and news stories that influence opinions on a daily basis. This might be more of a reflection of their fear of competition rather than a legitimate portrayal of the value of the cryptocurrency industry.

Certainly, if you prefer safe and reliable investments with moderate-to-low gains in the short term, Bitcoin is probably not the right investment for you.

However, if you are looking to potentially gain big by investing in a growing new industry, and are not afraid of the “spring cleaning” that is currently needed to make improvements to the future security and useability of cryptocurrency, it might be just the right time to buy Bitcoin.

After all, where there is no risk, there is no reward — and it may be wise not to wait until everyone is singing the praises of Bitcoin in the coming years to make the decision to invest.

Weiss Ratings has outlined key reasons why investors should be bullish about bitcoin, seeing a “ferocious rally” with the price of the cryptocurrency expected to hit $70,000 next year. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s massive money-printing and institutional investments into cryptocurrencies add to the bullishness.

Why Weiss Ratings Is Bullish on Bitcoin

Weiss Ratings analysts Bruce Ng and Juan Villaverde explained last week why investors should be bullish about bitcoin despite some sideways consolidations. Weiss Ratings currently ranks bitcoin first among all cryptocurrencies overall.

One of the three key reasons why the analysts are bullish about bitcoin stems from a price prediction based on the stock-to-flow analysis (S2F). The popular forecasting model “now points to a ferocious rally over the next 12 months or so,” they wrote.

Ng and Villaverde described that “S2F is based on the common-sense notion that the scarcer a commodity is, the more valuable it becomes,” adding that scarcity is measured by circulating supply. For example, Gold has an S2F of 62, which is “the number of years of current production required to match global above-ground holdings,” they clarified.

After the May Bitcoin halving, 6.25 new bitcoins are being created every 10 minutes, meaning “it would take an estimated 56 years for new mintage to match Bitcoin’s circulating supply,” they continued. “Notice how close that is to the S2F number for gold, which makes sense because bitcoin is fast becoming a major rival to gold as a safe-haven investment.”

The analysts added that “previous S2F predictions line up quite well with bitcoin’s actual price performance,” as seen in the chart above, elaborating:

Now, based on the history of the halving, current S2F analysis says bitcoin should reach $70,000 by — sometime around mid-2021 … Even if it turns out to be only half right, you could still triple your money.

The other two reasons Weiss Ratings’ analysts highlighted were “QE infinity” and institutional money flowing into cryptocurrencies. The covid-19 pandemic environment has pushed the Federal Reserve to print $2.9 trillion in new paper money in just 13 weeks, or about $22 million a minute, the analysts detailed. “By any measure, this is corruption of money on an industrial scale,” they exclaimed, predicting that investors will pour money into bitcoin and gold “as a safe haven when they lose confidence in paper money.”

Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz has also been saying that central banks printing record amount of money is the best environment for bitcoin.

The last major factor Ng and Villaverde focused on was the increasing interest in cryptocurrency among institutional investors, such as by Paul Tudor Jones who invested about $210 million of his own money into bitcoin. Grayscale Investments has been adding bitcoin to its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust faster than the rate of new coins being mined and recently, venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz raised half a billion dollars to invest in crypto startups. The analysts opined:

The sheer weight of institutional-sized money flows into a small market like bitcoin can have truly explosive effects.

In the first several months of 2020 alone in France, Germany and Australia, authorities issued decisions with three different interpretations of the nature of Bitcoin: as a currency, a financial instrument that is applied as a means of exchange among individuals or legal entities, and as a security.

Meanwhile, the taxation system, the complexity of regulation and reporting depend on the classification of cryptocurrencies. For example, currency functions in conditions of relatively weak regulatory oversight. Securities, by contrast, are usually subject to more onerous rules regarding price transparency and trade reporting.

Only one thing is for sure: Cryptocurrencies are difficult to attribute to any existing class of assets because they are unique. Given that cryptocurrencies are very different from one another, they also fit into several classes. But that issue aside, here’s what the legal regimes for cryptocurrencies in various countries make of crypto in 2020.

United States

The U.S. is a hub of cryptocurrency regulation in the world and sets the pace, for better or worse, for a lot of adoption. To begin with, laws governing the crypto industry vary from state to state, and federal authorities also interpret and regulate them differently. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which analyzes transactions to flag financial crimes, does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender. However, since 2013, it has been considering cryptocurrency exchanges financial as services operators and tokens as “other property” that replaces currency.

Exchanges must obey the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. The Internal Revenue Service, the nation’s tax authority, on the other hand, views cryptocurrencies as property and has issued a tax guide.

Several federal regulators have also been fighting to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission considers cryptocurrencies as securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission considers Bitcoin to be a commodity and oversees the cryptocurrency derivatives market.

2020 began with news about the introduction of new restrictions, as the U.S. Treasury Secretary said that the office intended to introduce stricter rules regarding digital currencies to prevent suspicious transactions using cryptocurrencies. But a month later, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which fights cross-border crimes in the U.S., developed a new method to track unlicensed cryptographic activity and proposed a Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program for 2021. The cryptocurrency intelligence program offers new rules and requirements for tax reporting in order to pave the way for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in the country.

However, in March of this year, the U.S. saw a major economic slowdown due to COVID-19 containment efforts and many voicing the opinion that cryptocurrencies could help the population in difficult times. The U.S. government allowed Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, to take part in the federal program to help the economy through the crypto application CashApp. The company in the U.S. was able to get low-interest loans.

Cryptocurrencies are not prohibited in the U.S., but they are still not integrated into the country’s financial structure, with the SEC striking down attempts to register a product that can be accessed by regular investors. Just a few of such examples range from stalling the launch of Facebook’s brainchild Libra to rejecting numerous Bitcoin-ETF applications or the abrupt proceedings between the SEC and Telegram over the latter’s Gram tokens.

At the end of March 2020, there was a bill submitted to the U.S. Congress that mentioned a digital dollar in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it soon disappeared from the document and that was that. Glen Goodman, the author of The Crypto Trader shared his view with Cointelegraph on the U.S. government’s attitude toward a national cryptocurrency. According to him, the U.S. has everything to lose when it comes to crypto:

“So the U.S. establishment is very nervous about encouraging any cryptocurrencies that could threaten the dollar’s dominant position in global finance. The U.S. enjoys what’s long been called the ‘exorbitant privilege’ of being able to print seemingly endless dollars and borrow unprecedented amounts without causing a collapse in the dollar. This is all because nearly every other country uses dollars as the standard for international trade and finance. As long as everyone needs dollars, the U.S. prints and borrows freely without crashing their currency.”

Russia

In Russia, where the population is rather crypto-friendly, the government still has not decided what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are but appears to be mostly hostile toward the technology. It has not issued a ban, however, at least not yet. So far, it is possible to understand what Russia makes of crypto through its court decisions.

Since 2018, there have been two cases where crypto was recognized as “other property.” In May 2018, the court came to such a verdict and ordered the debtor to transfer access to their crypto wallet. The second case occurred in February 2020 where the court also issued a similar decision, recognizing Bitcoin as other property.

However, the most interesting thing in Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is the long-delayed adoption of the corresponding law, which should help develop a new type of financial asset in the country, but has been stuck in limbo since 2018. This year, the Russian government has already drafted this act several times only to postpone its implementation each time.

At the beginning of this year, it became known that the Russian government decided to update the law on bribery and the fight against money laundering in relation to cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the law will classify any cryptocurrency transaction as a potential money-laundering risk. Later, the country’s Central Bank sought to ban the use of cryptocurrencies as a payment method.

But all-in-all, it seems that financial regulators in Russia can’t find a compromise between allowing or prohibiting cryptocurrencies. The latest version of the law called On Digital Financial Assets appeared in early July and defined Bitcoin as property but not as legal tender. Many experts doubt this act will ever be adopted.

Europe: Small countries — Great vision

Cryptocurrencies are legal throughout the European Union, but specific regulation and standards vary among countries. In matters of taxes, most EU countries are guided by the decision of the European Court of Justice of 2015, according to which the exchange of cryptocurrencies should be exempted from value-added tax.

Additionally, all European countries have adjusted their regulatory standards to the recommendations issued by the Financial Action Task Force in June 2019. According to the FATC, any crypto site should begin to comply with strict Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering standards, as well as sharing data with the regulator.

In January 2020, the 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive came into effect, requiring the registration of cryptocurrency exchanges with financial regulators and the transfer of client wallet addresses to them. In general, the EU has been gradually tightening its regulation of the cryptocurrency market.

The global economic instability caused by the novel coronavirus has affected the development of the crypto industry in Europe, accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies in some countries.

France is one of the few remaining EU countries where there is still no clear definition of cryptocurrencies. In March of this year, a lower court called the Commercial Court of Nanterre recognized BTC as currency, making it a fungible interchangeable asset. Although there is no case law in the country, this court ruling may have set an effective precedent.

In Portugal, the government decided to follow its neighbors and pushed the spread of cryptocurrencies with technological free zones. At the end of April, the country approved a nationwide plan to promote digitization in several areas. The Portuguese government will provide infrastructure and incentives for innovation, entrepreneurship and competition, as well as for the internationalization of enterprises in the country.

The tiny territory of Gibraltar seems to be positioning itself as the real cryptocurrency hotspot this year, attracting crypto firms with a regulatory framework that grants a formal license. Gibraltar introduced a permissive regulatory regime for blockchain firms back in 2018 and since then, has become very attractive to leading industry companies such Huobi. Furthermore, the country became the first in Europe to develop rules governing the activities of initial coin offerings.

Regulatory future

Of course, each country has its own attitude toward cryptocurrencies; some countries do not want to accept the asset as it is, to brand it as illegal, while others create the legal framework and benefit from the fact that the cryptocurrency market makes a profit. One can only hope that sooner or later, all countries of the world will understand that cryptocurrencies are firmly entrenched in our lives, and we should accept them in one form or another. Dave Hodgson, the chief investment officer and managing director of NEM Ventures, believes that legalization will take place gradually:",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/71321/crypto-friendly-signature-bank-was-the-most-popular-among-industry-firms-seeking-ppp-loans,"A review of data from the U.S. government's Payroll Protection Program reveals that two crypto-friendly banks were the most popular among those seeking such loans.

The Block's Steven Zheng found that Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — both of which maintain a range of crypto industry firms as clients — facilitated nine and eight loans, respectively. The Block Research's data set included nearly 70 crypto firms gleaned from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's release last week.

As The Block previously reported, companies in the blockchain space applied for PPP loans. The PPP program provides financial support to U.S. companies and help them retain employees during the pandemic-related economic shutdowns.

Industry firms identified in the data include derivatives platform LedgerX, development firm Tendermint and Ethereum blockchain studio ConsenSys. The Block also applied for and received a PPP loan.

New heights could be reached at the end of 2020

Whale Alert’s study, which relies on data from the crypto scam tracking site, Scam Alert, suggests that the popularity of dozens of different types of scams have been on the rise. Some of these include giveaways, sextortion, fake exchanges, fake ICO’s, Bitcoin recovery, video scams, fake tumblers, and malware.

In 2017, scammers stole roughly $5M in Bitcoin from unsuspecting victims. In the first quarter of 2020, users had nearly 5x that amount stolen for a total of $24 million. Whale Alert’s study forecasts that this figure could rise as high as $50 million by the end of the year.

Celebrity impersonation scams dominate

Whale Alert made case studies of a number of well known incidents. One of the most popular — in which scammers impersonated Elon Musk — made over $130,000 in a single day.

Fake exchanges are also one of the leading sub-genres in the world of successful crypto scams. One such website raked in over $1.5 million in 2020 alone. According to the report, that particular site remains active.

Whale Alert commented:

“The change in method and the increase in quality and scale suggests that entire professional teams are now behind some of the most successful ones and it is just a matter of time before they start using deepfakes, a technique that will surely revolutionize the scam market.”

Cointelegraph recently reported that fraudulent websites had successfully stolen personal records from a number of individuals around the world.

The attack was executed as a targeted multistage BTC scam propagated by a number of fraudulent websites, according to a study by the intelligence company, Group-IB.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/71342/fidelity-holds-over-10-stake-in-bitcoin-mining-firm-hut-8,"Asset management giant Fidelity holds about 10.6% stake in Canada-based publicly traded bitcoin mining firm Hut 8, according to a regulatory filing.

Hut 8 filed an alternative monthly reporting (AMR) with the Ontario Securities Commission on Friday, stating that Fidelity holds a mix of its common shares and common share purchase warrants, representing approximately 10.6% stake.

""Fidelity holds 8,396,138 Common Shares and 2,054,956 common share purchase warrants, as a result of which Fidelity is deemed to hold 10,451,094 Common Shares representing approximately 10.58% of the outstanding shares of that class,"" per the AMR filing. An AMR is filed by Canadian public companies to disclose their ""eligible institutional investor"" — in Hut 8's case, it is Fidelity.

The event that triggered Hut 8 to file the AMR is its recent underwritten public offering, which closed on June 25. Hut 8 issued 5,750,456 ""units"" (each unit consisted of one common share and one common share purchase warrant) at a price of $1.45 per unit for raising around $8.34 million. The firm raised funds to purchase a mix of MicroBT's Whatsminer M30S, M31S, and M31S+ to improve its bitcoin hash rate.

Fidelity's investment in Hut 8 is significant since the asset management giant is known to be mining bitcoin since 2014. Earlier this year, Fidelity was also hiring a bitcoin mining engineer to scale its operations.

A Fidelity spokesperson told The Block at the time: ""Over the past couple of years, we have expanded our mining efforts to ramp up our knowledge of the space. We have explored optimal locations, hardware procurement, mining farm setups, and the economics of the mining industry as a whole.""

Hut 8 began its operations in 2017 and is still a loss-making company. It suffered ""a loss of $0.6 million in Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization], compared to Q1-2019 loss of $1.3 million."" The firm also underwent a management change recently.

Hut 8 is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange since March 2018, and its share price is down by over 65% since listing. It is currently trading at about $0.82 apiece and has a market capitalization of over $80 million, according to TradingView.",,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/13/2061247/0/en/BOTS-Inc-Completes-Acquisition-of-Majority-Ownership-in-First-Bitcoin-Capital-s-Crypto-Assets.html,"San Juan, PUERTO RICO, July 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- BOTS, Inc.

Robotic Automation in manufacturing is driving US growth. According to a survey recently released by Boston Consulting Group, companies that sell goods in the US and plan to add production capacity, plan to add that capacity in the US more than in any other country. One driver of this shift, according to the survey, can be attributed to increases in automation technology. This includes robotic automation in manufacturing. Increases in automation combined with other advantages such as skilled labor, supply chains, and customer proximity are driving companies to bring or return their production to the US.

Industrial robots have been around for over 40 years and have advanced robotic automation in manufacturing. But, according to BCG, 90% of all tasks in manufacturing are still performed manually.

“There’s no question industrial robots have had a large impact but we believe in the coming post pandemic times, there will be even larger opportunities and markets to develop which will extensively expand into digital robotics enhancing the maturing Internet and the Blockchain revolution. We are on a 4th generation of automation - what is known now as ‘Industry 4.0’,” commented Paul Rosenberg - BOTS, Inc. CEO.

paul@bots.bz",2020-07-13 00:00:00,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/bitcoin-thieves-hit-cashaa/,"Cyber-criminals have compromised a British cryptocurrency exchange, making off with over $3m in Bitcoin.

Cashaa has halted all its crypto-related transactions after cyber-criminals stole more than 336 Bitcoin from its exchange. The company has said that prima facia users have not been impacted by the theft.

In a media brief shared with Cointelegraph, Cashaa’s CEO Kumar Gaurav said: “We are still investigating the damage caused by the incident and suspend all the withdrawals for 24 hours.”

Kumar said that the theft occurred after malicious hackers compromised one of the exchange’s digital wallets. Once access had been gained, the hackers sent the cryptocurrency contained within the wallet to themselves.

Guarav said that he had reason to believe that the cyber-criminals who hit Cashaa are based in East Delhi, India. Acting on this suspicion, the exchange has filed a cyber-crime incident report with the Delhi crime bureau under the cryptocurrency crime category.

A meeting of Cashaa’s board has been called to determine whether the company will bear all the losses associated with the crime.

Cashaa said it believes that to carry out the theft, cyber-criminals installed malware onto a computer used to make exchange transfers like user withdrawals. This malware sent a notification to the cyber-criminals at 1:23pm on July 10 when an employee logged into the account and made two transfers from a Blockchain.com wallet. It was this wallet that was then compromised and illegally relieved of over 336 Bitcoin.

The company is now taking steps to prevent the cyber-criminals who hit Cashaa from selling the stolen cryptocurrency on exchanges. On Twitter, Cashaa posted the Bitcoin address of the hacker in hopes of tracking any movement of the illegally acquired funds.

Guarav said Bitcoin thefts were on the rise because some cryptocurrency exchanges made it easy for cyber-criminals to launder stolen funds.

“As of today, hackers are very confident to hack crypto-addresses and move it through exchanges that are facilitating such laundering through their systems,” said Guarav.

“Exchanges like these must be shut down and owners of these exchanges should be charged with money laundering facilitation crime.”",2020-07-13 19:15:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/71452/crypto-hedge-fund-paradigm-is-now-sponsoring-a-bitcoin-core-developer,"Crypto investment firm Paradigm is joining the list of digital asset companies that fund bitcoin development with a grant for Australian bitcoin core developer Anthony Towns.

The California-based crypto investment firm is known for backing the likes of Tagomi, Argent, and Uniswap. Co-founder Matt Huang told The Block its move to fund bitcoin development reflects the firm's view that bitcoin is ""the most important cryptocurrency"" and that Paradigm has a responsibility to support its improvement.

Firms like Square Crypto, OKCoin, and BitMEX have backed bitcoin developers in the past, with the latter two firms most recently partnering to grant $150,000 to Bitcoin Core developer Amirit Uttarwar. Huang declined to share exactly how much Paradigm will pay Towns, whose work was previously financed by Xapo. Still, he described the grant as equivalent to an engineer's full salary. Towns has actively contributed to open-source development for more than two decades, contributing to bitcoin since 2017. He has worked on previous upgrades to the network such as Schnorr and Taproot.

""Paradigm will be paying his salary, but he will have complete freedom to choose what he works on in terms of bitcoin open-source,"" Huang said in a phone interview with The Block.

The former Sequoia Capital partner said the grant is one way to give back to the bitcoin community but also brings Paradigm ""closer to the metal."" The tie-up is unique to the crypto world inasmuch as Paradigm is an investment firm, rather than an exchange like BitMEX or a development company like Blockstream. The terms of the grant will require Towns to help in the due diligence of new opportunities in and around the bitcoin ecosystem, such as second-layer applications.

""A second-order element of this is the fact that having him close to the firm will expose us to interesting opportunities,"" he said. ""Still, we are far-seeing enough to know that anything we could benefit from in the short term may not be aligned with what is beneficial in the long-run and so we won't have a role in directing what Towns does.""",,https://securityboulevard.com/2020/07/schrodingers-cryptocurrency-both-private-and-not/,"Everyone knows that Bitcoin is an anonymous currency. Except when it isn’t. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies attempt to achieve the incompatible goals of providing strong accountability for transactions through blockchain and strong anonymity. If the government wanted to obtain information about a user’s bank account, it would simply subpoena the records from a bank under the Bank Secrecy Act and the powers of the grand jury and obtain the information they needed. Not so for Bitcoin, since there is no “central authority” from which to get records of transactions.

Cryptocurrency Under the Privacy Microscope

On June 30, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that federal agents could obtain information about Bitcoin and blockchain transactions from cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase with a simple subpoena because users of cryptocurrency, which is specifically touted for its privacy and anonymity features, have no “reasonable expectation of privacy” in the transactions that occur on a public ledger system such as Bitcoin. It’s Schrodinger’s cryptocurrency: both anonymous and public at the same time.

The case arose out of an investigation of child pornography purchased from a website using Bitcoin. As the federal appeals court noted:

When a Bitcoin user transfers Bitcoin to another address, the sender transmits a transaction announcement on Bitcoin’s public network, known as a blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain contains only the sender’s address, the receiver’s address, and the amount of Bitcoin transferred. The owners of the addresses are anonymous on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it is possible to discover the owner of a Bitcoin address by analyzing the blockchain. For example, when an organization creates multiple Bitcoin addresses, it will often combine its Bitcoin addresses into a separate, central Bitcoin address (i.e., a “cluster”). It is possible to identify a “cluster” of Bitcoin addresses held by one organization by analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain transaction history. Open source tools and private software products can be used to analyze a transaction.

Currency exchanges such as Coinbase maintain records of users who have transferred funds from or to these “clusters,” which can be identified from public records. In the course of the child porn investigation, the government issued a grand jury subpoena to Coinbase to try to identify the Bitcoin user associated with the cluster, and therefore with the child porn. The question for the federal court was whether the government could get those records from Coinbase with a simple subpoena or whether it needed a search warrant supported by probable cause. And to decide that, the court had to decide whether people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in these records.

No Party Like a Third Party

As a general rule, you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own records, unless you have voluntarily exposed such records to the public. There’s a lot to unwind in that sentence, though. First, what are “your records”? Are your bank records “yours,” or are they the bank’s records of how you used the service? What about your phone records, hotel records, travel records, credit card records, library account, internet browsing history, GPS records and other records created by third parties and held by them? Are those “your” records for which you have a reasonable expectation of privacy and for which the government has to get a search warrant, or are they the records of the institution that either creates the records or stores them? If they are things such as your personal e-mails and chats (unless made public), they are yours, you have an expectation of privacy and a warrant is required.

The U.S. Supreme Court waded into this quagmire some years ago when it ruled in 1979 that no warrant was required to get telephone toll records since the caller knew that the phone company kept such records and that, by using a phone, they voluntarily exposed their calls to the phone company (these were the days even before caller ID). Besides, it noted, the phone book gave the user a warning (terms of service?) that such records were created. This was the so-called “third party” doctrine, whereby the government could get, by grand jury subpoena, things such as your accountants’ work papers, bank records or other “third party” records.

In 2018, the Supreme Court changed course in a case involving cell tower location records, holding that, even though the records of a cell phone’s location (based on which towers it was pinging) were records of a third party (the phone company), the user had a reasonable expectation of privacy in what these records revealed about them (their location everywhere, every time they had a phone) and therefore a search warrant rather than a subpoena was needed to obtain the records. The test was not ownership or possession but privacy.

So what about blockchain and bitcoin? Private or not?

Privacy in ‘Public’ Information

The Supreme Court’s holding that cell tower location records were “private” was unusual in that the underlying information—where someone is when they are traveling in public—is (or can be) publicly available. When you are driving around in the public, no warrant is needed to follow you around and track your movements, and while a warrant may be needed to attach a GPS device to your car, no warrant is needed to track you in public.

Blockchain and bitcoin transactions occur in public. The Fifth Circuit noted that “Bitcoin users are unlikely to expect that the information published on the Bitcoin blockchain will be kept private, thus undercutting their claim of a ‘legitimate expectation of privacy’” because it “is well known that each Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a publicly available blockchain.” The court finally concluded, “There is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected area because there is no constitutional privacy interest in the information on the blockchain” and therefore, it’s OK to monitor cryptocurrency and other such transactions with software and obtain transaction records without a warrant. Somewhat gratuitously, the court concluded also that, unlike ubiquitous cell phones, which are a staple of modern life (a necessity), cryptocurrencies are not “central to most people’s daily lives.”

The takeaway here is that transactions, communications, records or recordings that, while anonymous (or nearly so), occur in a public arena may not be entitled to legal protections because the public nature of the forum may create the concept that the records are not entitled to any expectation of privacy—despite the fact that the transactions are encrypted, secured, obscured and anonymous. Or at least partly so. As Scott Fitzgerald noted, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” So we need more first-rate intelligence.",2020-07-13 06:00:26+00:00,https://decrypt.co/35352/grayscale-large-cap-fund-shifts-focus-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum,"In brief Digital assets management firm Grayscale has increased the weighting of Bitcoin and Ethereum in its Digital Large-Cap investment fund.

Grayscale announced in a Twitter thread on July 12 that the composition of its DLC fund had shifted moving into Q2 of 2020. Between March and June, the percentage of Bitcoin in the fund increased from 81% to 81.5%, while Ethereum’s weighting in the fund increased from 9.6% to 11.7%.

The presence of three other major altcoins in the fund was reduced in the same time period. XRP’s (XRP) weighting dropped from 5% to 3.6%; Bitcoin Cash fell from 2.8% to 2%; and Litecoin’s presence decreased from 1.6% to 1.2%.

3/ Although no new assets qualified for inclusion following DLC Fund's Quarterly Review (6/30/20), the below table highlights how DLC Fund’s weightings have changed from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020: $BTC $ETH $XRP $BCH $LTC pic.twitter.com/1OyP0JJ4Rb — Grayscale (@GrayscaleInvest) July 6, 2020

Grayscale’s single-asset investment funds for Bitcoin and Ethereum are the largest under the firm’s management, totalling $3.5 billion and $410 million respectively. Comparatively, the single-asset funds for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and XRP total less than $12 million between them.

Grayscale’s appetite for Bitcoin

The world’s largest crypto-investment firm signaled a renewed thirst for Bitcoin throughout most of 2020. Prior to the Bitcoin halving event, Grayscale was estimated to be purchasing the equivalent of around half of all Bitcoin mined. In the two weeks after Bitcoin’s halving, Grayscale’s rate of Bitcoin acquisition increased to 153% of all BTC mined in that period.

By early April, the digital asset investment firm was also shown to be purchasing the equivalent of half of all ETH mined in 2020, eventually coming to own 1.1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply.

It’s conceivable that Grayscale’s re-evaluation of its DLC fund is a reaction to market conditions. Since March 31, the global market dominance of Ethereum increased from 8.17%, to over 9.8% at time of writing. In the same time period, XRP’s market dominance fell from 4.21% to 3.28%. Bitcoin Cash’s dominance decreased from 2.27% to 1.6%. Likewise, Litecoin’s dominance dropped from 1.4% to 1.07%, according to CoinMarketCap.

The only exception to this trend is Bitcoin, the market dominance of which fell from 65.78% from March 31, to 62.46% at time of writing. This could be a result of the recent block reward halving, which resulted in half as many BTC being produced by Bitcoin miners.",2020-07-13 09:40:25,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-could-issue-a-crypto-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-20,"South Korean private sector members recently discussed a crypto-related taxation bill meant to establish capital gains tax for cryptocurrencies. During these discussions on July 13, members indicated crypto gains taxes could rise as high as 20%.

Cryptocurrencies could be considered as “goods”

Proposed amendments to existing laws also plan to classify cryptocurrencies as “goods,” rather than currencies.

Lawmakers have established that virtual assets can be considered as electronic certificates of economic value that can be traded electronically. However, when the transactions are for sales purposes, it could be viewed as an asset.

A South Korean court referenced Bitcoin (BTC) in their judgement, stating:

“Until now, virtual assets have been recognized only as a function of currency and have not been subject to income tax, but recently, virtual assets (like Bitcoin) are increasingly being traded as goods with property value. Considering various conditions, such as the recognition of intangible assets with property value, the necessity of taxation, and the recognition of the property value of virtual assets are being raised at the same time.”

The article also states that crypto trading withholds capital gains tax for those who do not reside in the country.

Figures from South Korean financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission show an average of 1.33 trillion won ($1.10 billion) were being traded per day using crypto. Additionally, an average of 7.609 billion ($6.33 million) won was traded between January - May of 2020.

Korean Yonsei University economist, Sung Tae-yoon, warned that the decision to tax crypto capital gains in South Korea may slow the technology’s emerging market.",,https://www.techradar.com/news/crypto-exchange-coinbase-could-go-public-later-this-year,"Coinbase could be the first major player in the cryptocurrency industry to go public in the US, reports have claimed.

The company is yet to announce its intentions to go public, but has apparently been in talks with investment banks and law firms in what would mark a milestone for the crypto market.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses have been in limbo in the US for the past several years, as banks have largely shunned the industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not issued regulatory guidance on the majority of digital coins. A stock market listing for Coinbase would lend legitimacy to other companies built around cryptocurrency and potentially pave the way for future IPOs.

Coinbase listing

Before it can go public, Coinbase will need approval from the SEC. Coinbase has not yet filed an application with the agency and the SEC has been silent on the question of whether Coinbase will be allowed to proceed.

Notably, Coinbase isn’t planning to enter public markets through an initial public offering (IPO). Instead, it expects to use a direct listing in which it will not issue new shares.

A direct listing would reward existing shareholders, since there is no lock-up period in which they are barred from selling their Coinbase shares. In addition, this route avoids watering down the value of existing shares with a new issuance.

Coinbase was last valued at $8 billion during a private financing round in 2018, and the crypto market has only grown since then. Coinbase added more than eight million users from 2018 to 2019 and the marketplace recently surpassed 35 million total accounts. Coinbase currently operates in the US and more than 100 other countries around the world.

It’s for this reason that various options have been improved over time to make buying Bitcoin faster, easier, and accessible to everyone. Unlike a few years ago, today everything is so simplified that you can buy this cryptocurrency from your home.

Do You Need a “Bag of Money” to Own Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is worth about $ 9,200 but what many don’t know when it comes to this most valuable cryptocurrency is that it’s made up of smaller values (like 1 USD is made up of 100 pennies), and its lowest value (0.000 000 01 BTC) is called Satoshi (SAT). Other values that exist (higher that Satoshi) are Microbit (µBTC), Millibit (mBTC), etc.

People are attracted to buying Bitcoin because:

It’s the most famous currency that has exists for 10 years.

Despite all the fluctuations, it’s by far the most valuable, and only one unit brings big profits.

It’s also the widest means of payment and it can be used to pay for hotels, airline tickets, travel vouchers…

These are just some of the reasons why the BTC currency is so in demand, and through smaller denominations, it’s available to everyone.

Tips for Safe Buying

No matter what the amounts are, take the whole process seriously. Carefully choose the type of Bitcoin wallet and trade intermediary. Why does it all matter? We believe that those who bought the first units of BTC had no idea what values this currency would reach. A Bitcoin wallet is the only connection to your Bitcoin funds. Loss or damage will lead to the inability to log in to your account and thus permanent loss of units.

Choose an intermediary in the trade according to how many years they have been operating, on what platform the business they are based, how much commission they take, what data they ask for the realization of the business. It’s best to choose those that do business directly with the currency of your country because that way you don’t lose on the exchange rate difference.

What Are the Options for Buying Bitcoin?

Exchange Offices

Exchange offices are intermediaries in the purchase of Bitcoin and receive a commission for their services. This type of purchase requires you to leave personal data and very often a link to a bank account. The exchange office will determine how much BTC units you can buy for a certain amount of money according to the daily exchange rate.

If you’re satisfied with the offer, the exchange office withdraws money from the bank account and starts the purchase procedure. In a couple of hours, you become the owner.

Peer-To-Peer

There are websites that organize a direct face-to-face meeting between the person who sells and buys Bitcoin. Both parties must bring a Bitcoin wallet with them to follow through the whole exchange process so that there are no embezzlements.

ATMs

Scanning your address code opens up options for the purchase process. Insert the cash into the ATM and the cryptocurrency is transferred to the scanned address. This is a very simple way of purchasing, and ATMs are available in every major city.

Stock Markets

To access one of the stock markets, you have to register, leave personal data, and take a picture of your passport/driver’s license/ID card. To complete the verification, you must either go to the stock market headquarters with an ID card yourself or have the code sent to you by mail, which you’ll receive only after you show your ID card. Only then the account is open and you’re allowed to start trading by transferring funds from the bank.

Trading Websites

How to buy Bitcoin on websites that are authorized to trade cryptocurrencies? You can create a Bitcoin wallet or enter information about an existing crypto wallet. For this service, websites charge a commission that varies from supply and demand.

It’s possible to trade payments from all accounts, money transfer via PayPal, Western Union… A transaction made this way is realized quickly, the data is protected, and that’s the reason why this is one of the more popular trading methods.

Conclusion

You’re entering a world of virtual currencies where large amounts can be earned but also lost. So it’s good advice not to invest huge sums but to gradually increase the number of Bitcoin units you own.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is a good way to place surplus funds, and earnings can be much higher than with classic investment funds. With all this in mind, you’ll have fewer surprises while taking part in the Bitcoin market.",2020-07-14 00:00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/71483/paypal-reveals-that-it-is-developing-crypto-capabilities,"Payments giant PayPal has revealed that it is developing cryptocurrency capabilities.

In a letter to the European Commission in March, PayPal said it is “monitoring the evolution of the crypto-asset space” and has taken “unilateral and tangible steps to further develop its capabilities in this area,” especially since the Libra stablecoin project was announced in June 2019.

PayPal was a member of the Libra project for about four months before it withdrew in October 2019, along with other payment giants such as Mastercard and Visa.

PayPal’s revelation is significant since it is said to be in the works to offer crypto buying and selling services to its over 300 million users. PayPal's response to the commission is part of a public consultation that opened in December 2019 — the commission wanted feedback on building an EU framework for crypto-assets.

PayPal said it is supportive of such a framework. The company said blockchain and crypto-assets could help achieve “greater financial inclusion and help reduce/eliminate some of the pain points that exist today in financial services.”

“As these technologies continue to evolve, we believe thoughtful regulation that fosters innovation while promoting clarity can help the industry grow and thrive,” said PayPal.

The company wants the commission to set clear definitions of various crypto activities to ensure adequate consumer and investor protection. PayPal has also suggested the commission to put crypto-activities within the scope of applicable anti-money laundering rules.

“Any regulatory framework in Europe should strive to be technology neutral to support innovation and competition in this fast-evolving space,” said PayPal.

The company has a license to provide banking and payments services in Luxembourg, and serves customers and businesses in 31 European jurisdictions, representing about 95 million merchants and consumers.



PayPal has been active in the crypto space since as early as 2014. At the time, the company partnered with three bitcoin payment processors, including Coinbase, which allowed merchants in its network to accept bitcoin as payment.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/us-army-tools-track-cryptocurrency-transactions/,"US Army Requests Information on Tools to Track Cryptocurrency Transactions

The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army have requested information on web-based cryptocurrency tracking tools. The tools must enable U.S. government agencies worldwide to conduct in-depth investigations into the source of crypto transactions and provide multi-currency analysis from bitcoin to other top cryptocurrencies.

US Government Wants to Track Crypto Transactions

The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army have posted a request for information (RFI) entitled “cryptocurrency investigative web-based application.” The request was published on the U.S. government’s website on July 10.

“All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary,” the notice states, adding that “The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (CC-NJ) located at Fort Dix, NJ is surveying the market for potential contractors capable of providing one license for one user of a cloud, web based application capable of assisting law enforcement to identify and stop actors who are using cryptocurrencies for illicit activity such as fraud, extortion, and money laundering.”

The request’s accompanying Statement of Work (SOW) describes that the contractor must provide “access to a reliable cryptocurrency investigation service, also referred to as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution required for use in criminal investigations and the other missions conducted by the US Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC).” The USACIDC is the premier Military Criminal Investigative Organization within the Department of Defense, responsible for conducting worldwide criminal investigations wherever there is a U.S. Army interest. The notice elaborates:

Application must enables users to conduct in-depth investigation into the source of cryptocurrency transactions and provides multi-currency analysis from bitcoin to other top cryptocurrencies.

The USACIDC’s Major Cybercrime Unit in Quantico, VA, will administer the service but users can be located anywhere in the U.S. and overseas. Intended users include those in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The service must be a tested product, without hardware or software to install. It must meet the SOW requirements, including providing “real-time bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transaction tracing” and “be able to spot transaction patterns and interactions with other entities.” The contract will be for one year with the option to extend four more years. Responses to the information request must be made by July 20.

The Department of Defense’s request came after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service awarded a contract for blockchain analytics software to Coinbase, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.

Huobi is one of the largest Bitcoin futures exchange, currently standing strong in the second position in terms of daily trading volume only following Binance, according to Coinmarketcap.com. The platform made its names with Bitcoin perpetual contracts, making them mainstream in the crypto industry.

The exchange explained that Bitcoin options are very similar to the futures, but the contract holders do not have any obligation to buy the asset upon maturity, instead the trader can exit by paying a pre-decided premium.

Rising demand for crypto derivatives

Huobi is jumping introducing the instrument when the market demand for Bitcoin options is skyrocketing. But Huobi will have to face some fierce competition from leading platforms including Deribit, CME Group, and even Binance.

Last month, CME Group reported that its Bitcoin options demand soared 10x, but Deribit is still holding 80 percent of the market.

Huobi detailed that its options contracts will be in European style, meaning the buyer of the Option can only be exercised at the expiration. The exchange also highlighted that initially only Bitcoin options will be in the offering, but did not specify any plans to expand with other digital assets.

“Huobi also offers incredibly low minimum positions of 0.001 BTC. This means that traders can open an Options position with around $10 compared to other exchanges where the minimum position can cost as much as 1 BTC,” the exchange noted.

The contracts are still in the alpha testing phase and after the completion, Huobi Futures will announce the official launch on Web and API, following an offering on the mobile trading application.",2020-07-14 09:20:18+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/texan-charged-ppp-fraud-bbq,"Disclosure

Read an extract here.

Almost five years ago on July 30, 2015, part of the Ethereum team had gathered in Berlin to see the network they helped build go live. A big screen overhanging their worktables served as the countdown clock for when the test network reached block 1,028,201. That’s the palindrome and prime number they picked as the key which would launch the mainnet. Others were waiting for the launch in Ethereum hubs in Amsterdam, Toronto, New York and Zug, Switzerland.

It was the culmination of months of work, where core developers did the heavy lifting on the technical side, but which also included designers, marketers, and community managers. Ethereans knew a distributed network with no community would fail.

Ethereum turns five on July 30, 2020. CoinDesk is marking five years of Ethereum with a series of retrospective stories and live-streamed Twitter conversations. There are even some “Easter eggs” for eagle-eyed readers. Tune in to our CoinDesk Live sessions July 27-31 at 4 p.m. Eastern each day or call +1 (661) 4-UNICRN.

Early Ethereum team members had also spent endless hours with lawyers leading up to the ether sale, some co-founders had gone through bitter fights, while many others had ravaged their savings working with no salaries towards one goal: Making the vision Vitalik Buterin laid out on a white paper in November 2013, a reality.

It’s happening

When the test network hit the predetermined block at 4:26 p.m. in Berlin, a meme of Ron Paul, jubilant, with his arms up and surrounded in green laser beams and white block letters that read IT’S HAPPENING, popped up on the monitor. The Ethereum team opened a bottle of champagne while rocket emojis filled chat rooms.

The Ethereum network quickly left other blockchain upstarts behind and has since grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, with ether’s market capitalization (as of writing) at just under $30 billion.

Minecraft of crypto-finance

But a better measure of success is to examine whether Ethereum builders achieved what they set out to do. Ethereum aims to be a “fully-fledged, Turing-complete (but heavily fee-regulated) cryptographic ledger,” which allows developers to build any application they can dream of on top, Vitalik wrote in the white paper, which inspired early team members to drop everything and join him in building it.

“Rather than being limited to a specific set of transaction types, users will be able to use Ethereum as a sort of ‘Minecraft of crypto-finance’ – that is to say, one will be able to implement any feature that one desires simply by coding it in the protocol’s internal scripting language,” he wrote. Minecraft is a sandbox-style video game, which gives players flexibility to explore and build whatever they want in the game’s virtual world.

Vitalik, who was 19 years old at the time, listed on the Ethereum white paper the applications he envisioned could be built on top of this generalized platform:

Sub-currencies “representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks and even currencies with only one unit issued to represent collectibles or smart property.”

Financial derivatives, such as “hedging contracts.” He notes that “financial contracts of any form do need to be fully collateralized; the Ethereum network controls no enforcement agency and cannot collect debt.”

Identity and reputation systems where “users can register their names in a public database alongside other data,” for example, for domain-name systems.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, which replicate traditional companies but use blockchain technology for enforcement. The entity would have shareholders who collect dividends and decide how the corporation automatically allocates its funds, “using either bounties, salaries or even more exotic mechanisms such as an internal currency to reward work.”

Also listed were crop and generic insurance, decentralized data feeds, gambling and prediction markets, a full-scale on-chain stock market and an on-chain decentralized marketplace.

Five years later, all of the use cases envisioned by Vitalik have become a reality, though some with more success than others.

(The Defiant)

Sub-currencies’ success

What Vitalik called sub-currencies – what we now know as tokens, stablecoins and NFTs – have arguably been the most successful applications on Ethereum so far. Valued at over $33 billion, Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens represent almost 13 percent of total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to Etherscan. Together with ether, all of the Ethereum ecosystem is about one-fourth of crypto.

The innovation of entrepreneurs being able to issue their own coins and sell them to anyone in the world in fundraising rounds, which for the first time didn’t need venture capitalists or banks, helped fuel one of the most spectacular speculative manias in 2017-2018. This past year, most growth has come from stablecoins, with tokens pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar trading at about $12 billion – that’s about three times stablecoin market cap a year ago, according to Messari data – most of which is on Ethereum, due mainly to Tether’s migration to the network.

Top tokens by market cap Source: CoinMarketCap

Non-fungible tokens and their marketplaces had their biggest moment with CryptoKitties in late 2017, but the space is arguably one of the brightest spots for innovation within Ethereum, with use cases from in-game items to art and limited-edition fashion.

Dexs and derivatives

“On-chain stock exchanges” are today’s decentralized exchanges. While they still represent a fraction of total volume traded on centralized crypto exchanges, growth has been staggering. Almost $5.7 billion have traded so far on DEXs this year, or more than twice the value trading hands in all of 2019, according to Dune Analytics. Beyond volume metrics, DEXs are delivering on the cypherpunk dream of seamless, global, non-custodial trading of cryptocurrencies.

Financial derivatives are also flourishing. Synthetic assets platforms such as Synthetix and UMA allow almost any assets to be represented on the Ethereum blockchain, while margin trading platforms such as dYdX have enabled futures trading, the most popular asset in centralized crypto finance.

Meanwhile, lending platforms including Compound and Aave allow users to gain interest on their crypto deposits, and tokenize those deposits so they can be simply bought on an exchange and held in users’ wallets.

DAOs started out early in Ethereum history as one of the strongest projects. The DAO attracted, at the time, the most capital ever for an Ethereum fundraiser, though we all know how that ended. After a traumatic experience, the Ethereum community steered clear of decentralized organizations for a couple of years, until 2019 ushered a DAO revival. Initially, these entities were focused on distributing donations, but that quickly evolved into for-profit DAOs, like The LAO and VentureDAO.

Ethereum has also given rise to applications in prediction markets, identity systems and insurance, but they’re lagging financial applications in terms of volume and adoption.

Internet of value

Financial applications have had the greatest success on Ethereum so far, arguably because it provides something that just can’t be replicated by the current financial system, or by bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency. It’s a global network that’s built to transfer value, and it can also process computer programs to allow for more sophisticated financial transactions. Value held in these financial platforms has soared to more than $2 billion this year, a fivefold increase from a year ago.

Value in DeFi (DeFi Pulse)

Ethereum has successfully become the Minecraft of crypto finance, as Vitalik envisioned. But beyond becoming a platform that can support all these different kinds of applications, the biggest impact is it’s creating an actual internet of value. It’s a network that enables fast, cheap, global value transfers and the ability to program that money to become anything from futures contracts to collectibles to derivatives pegged to stocks, forex and commodities. And it’s allowing users of this system to take charge of their own assets and data.

Almost any network metric will show there is demand for permissionless, trustless systems. Active addresses are near a record at just under 568,000, a stone throw’s away from bitcoin’s 745,000, according to CoinMetrics. Transaction fees paid to the network’s miners have surpassed bitcoin’s, while daily transaction count is almost four times that of the biggest cryptocurrency at about 1 million, the data show.

A good problem to have

The question isn’t whether there’s demand for Ethereum, but whether the network will continue developing fast enough to meet that demand. The wait for ETH 2.0, which would allow Ethereum to scale, has been a constant in Ethereum’s history. A barebones proof-of-stake chain, which was slated to launch early this year, has been delayed and now it’s unclear whether it will launch this year at all.

But progress with Layer 2 solutions, which take transactions off-chain, has been encouraging. Teams working on Optimistic Roll-Ups are testing prototypes, while solutions using Plasma and Zero Knowledge technology are live right now and able to handle thousands of transactions per second. While the wait for ETH2.0 continues, the wait for Ethereum scaling is over.",2020-07-14 12:44:09+00:00,https://inc42.com/buzz/tata-consultancy-services-launches-crypto-trading-solution-more/,"The prices of Bitcoin and Etherium by end of the year is expected to touch $12,948 and $333, reveals Finder’s Cryptocurrency Prediction Report

Also, one in five experts (23%) on Finder’s Cryptocurrency Prediction Report panel said that they are concerned about Ethereum’s economics as it shifts to Ethereum 2.0. However, despite concerns, the panel predicted ETH, on average, would hit $333 by year’s end.

Author of ‘Programming Bitcoin,’ Jimmy Song has the most bearish end of year prediction of $97 and said that he is worried the proof of stake isn’t secure and ‘would essentially centralise ETH in some serious ways.’

On the other end of the spectrum, Origin Protocol cofounder Josh Fraser, despite concerns, believes that the price would go as high as $1000.

Hackers Steal $3 Mn In BTC From Crypto Exchange Cashaa

British cryptocurrency exchange Cashaa recently announced that it will halt all its crypto-related transactions after hackers stole more than 336 Bitcoin from their exchange. Kumar Gaurav, CEO of Cashaa told Cointelegraph that the theft happened after hackers compromised one of the exchange’s digital wallets. “Once access had been gained, the hackers sent the cryptocurrency contained within the wallet to themselves,” he added.

He said that cyber-criminals who hit Cashaa are based in East Delhi. Based on this hunch, the company has filed a cyber-crime incident report with the Delhi crime branch under the cryptocurrency crime category. Now, the cryptocurrency exchange is taking preventive steps from tracing the hackers from selling the stolen cryptocurrency on exchanges. Also, Cashaa tweeted the Bitcoin address of the hacker in the hope of tracking any movement of the illegally acquired funds.

Trading Volume Of Cryptocurrency In India Increased By 400% Amid Lockdown

According to a report by The Hindu, several new players and even retail investors have entered the crypto trading market within the last four months. The trading volume of cryptocurrency in India has increased by 400% during the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Industry experts said that the increase in crypto trading is also said to have witnessed after the Supreme Court had lifted its ban earlier this year.

Ajeet Khurana, the former head of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of the Internet and Mobile Associaton of India (IAMAI) said that the daily crypto trading volume in India maybe $10-30 Mn. Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX also said that the company had seen a three to four times increase in sign-ups amid the lockdown.

UK Govt Most Likely To Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency Soon

The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey recently discussed the mechanism of a probable UK cryptocurrency backed by the central bank. According to a Bloomberg report, Bailey entered into a webinar discussion with students about a UK cryptocurrency, where they explored the relevance and the nuances of having a virtual currency in the country and its possible uses.",2020-07-14 07:23:50+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/charlie-shrem-tldl-ray-youssef-and-cryptos-role-in-africa,"Crypto luminary Charlie Shrem is joined by Ray Youssef of Paxful for a wide-ranging conversation on Youssef’s work building schools in Africa, Paxful’s mission to unite the continent through financial inclusion and crypto’s role in revolution.

This conversation has been abridged and adapted from Shrem’s Untold Stories podcast, found here. Here are the highlights, fit for print, of their hour-long conversation.

On motivation

Youssef: I remember it was 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, I saw this picture of this American lady who didn’t even have shoes. She had to make her shoes from garbage and cardboard. I said this is shameful. How can we support this in a civilized country? So I took my bags, went to New Orleans. I got there the first day they were letting people back in and walked into a ghost town.

I asked FEMA, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, everyone, trying to find people that could help. But no one knew a damn thing, it was the most disorganized effort you can imagine. No one knew anything except for five Dominican nuns I met. We helped rebuild the first school to open up in Old City, the New Orleans Cathedral Academy.

After we reopened the first school, the police and fire department could come back and that was like the official rebirth of the city. I looked at that and I was like, “Wow, one school can make a difference.” It stayed with me for a long time. Then, when we were in Africa I [had an epiphany]. It all started from there.

On crypto’s role in Africa

So our top route is China to Nigeria. We created that trade route four years ago and it was absolutely integral to actually solving the problems [we saw] when we landed in Africa. [When I said] bitcoin can help them, everyone said I was crazy because there’s no way people making $2 a day are going to invest in bitcoin.

That statement is true, but there’s a lot of people in Africa who make a lot more than $2 a day. They’re young, they’re hungry, upwardly mobile and they’re not using bitcoin as a form of investment. They’re using it as a medium of exchange, and that is the narrative that we bring to the people. And they get it completely. They taught us everything about what bitcoin is actually good for.

It's amazing what these young African entrepreneurs come up with if you give them an open-ended system.

Our mission at Paxful is to generate wealth, we want to make our users wealthy. We want to create wealth everywhere we go because that’s what financial liberation is all about. Africans have money; they just can’t use it. It’s easier for them to actually transport their physical bodies than it is for them to move their own money.

The truth is, the banking network charges an invisible tax upon nations. If you’re trying to move $10 million from Nigeria to Germany, the banks there will be like, “Ah, we already took $10 million from this bank in this country two months ago, we can’t put another one through.” They don’t [always] accept the money that comes in.

Every single bank in the world has their own standards. It is the most fractionalized, balkanized, messed up and downright – in a lot of ways – racist [system]. Because it’s a blanket tax put on an entire continent, and these people are basically excluded from the monetary system. Bitcoin solves this.

On the Pax Africana

We call our 20-year plan Pax Africana, which is to connect the entire country intercontinentally. Number one … there must be seamless settlement with the network when you send money from one African country to another. Paxful already supports gift cards, online wallets, bank transfers. We have commissions with over 100 African payment methods and are set to add over another 100 African payment methods soon.

Number two, water. Number three, education. … That’s the trifecta of civilization, so we’re building these dams and wells across Africa. We built our first school in Rwanda. We let other people from the surrounding district come in and get water there and [are trying to] make this sustainable by charging a fraction of a penny for [a jug] of water, which is a huge deal for them. It’s sustainable and it’s changing the lives of people.

For example, one young boy got up and said, thank you so much for this well, I can go to school now. He spent six hours of his day fetching water for his family. Imagine having one of those wells in every district across Africa? We’d [contribute] an enormous sum to the African GDP by freeing up their eldest child’s time, allowing them to go to school. That’s the kind of power that we can have for people.

[People are saying] like, ‘Hey, I built my own little version of Western Union on Paxful’ and I focus on South Africa to Nigeria. It’s amazing what these young African entrepreneurs come up with if you give them an open-ended system. It’s why I say Africa’s going to rule the world, because there’s an army of these young people that are so brilliant, it’s amazing.

On civil rights protests

I’m not a political guy, I try to keep my nose out of that. Every time humanity is about to embark upon a golden age, things happen to slow it down and they happen in different ways in different places. I would caution everyone in the United States to not be reactionary, do not join the process, sit down and think about order. Do not react to the things that are happening now…

I would encourage you to keep a cool head, do not be reactive, use the time to get to your spiritual core. This could turn into an orange revolution very quickly and that could be the destruction of the United States. As a proud American patriot, I really do pray every day that does not happen. Sometimes, to take a real stand you don’t have to do anything.

On the African franc

I was shocked and horrified to figure out a few years ago that the African franc is about as African as the Federal Reserve is. All the African francs are printed in Paris and the African countries have to actually pay the French for the right to use the money.

The African franc is a monstrosity that has completely kept 14 economies balkanized and unable to grow. This is modern-day colonialism, modern-day slavery. I talked to some people who run these countries and they’re disgusted by it. They say, “It’s kept our country basically in chains for the past 80 years. Why can’t we change it?”",2020-07-14 18:02:39+00:00

Apple, Elon Musk and Joe Biden were among the accounts compromised in a broadly targeted hack that remained mysterious hours after taking place. Those accounts and many others posted a message promoting the address of a bitcoin wallet with the claim that the amount of any payments made to the address would be doubled and sent back — a known cryptocurrency scam technique.

In the hours following the initial scam posts, Kim Kardashian West, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Wiz Khalifa, Warren Buffett, YouTuber MrBeast, Wendy’s, Uber, CashApp and Mike Bloomberg also posted the cryptocurrency scam.

While we’re still learning more specifics about how the hack went down, we can report that the hacker leveraged an internal Twitter admin tool to gain access to the high-profile accounts. That reporting was soon confirmed by Twitter’s own account of what happened. On Wednesday evening, the company tweeted that “a coordinated social engineering attack” on employees gave a hacker “access to internal systems and tools.”

We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 16, 2020

Before the scope of the incident became clear, the hack appeared to focus on cryptocurrency-focused accounts. In an initial wave of scam posts, @bitcoin, @ripple, @coindesk, @coinbase and @binance were hacked with the same message: “We have partnered with CryptoForHealth and are giving back 5000 BTC to the community,” followed by a link to a website.

The linked site was quickly pulled offline. Kristaps Ronka, chief executive of Namesilo, the domain registrar used by the scammers, told TechCrunch that the company suspended the domain “on the first report” it received. Hacked accounts shifted to sharing multiple bitcoin wallet addresses as the incident went on, making things more difficult to track.

Twitter first acknowledged the situation at 2:45 p.m. PT Wednesday afternoon, referring to it as a “security incident.”

We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter. We are investigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 15, 2020

At first, it appeared that some of the compromised accounts were back under their owners’ control as tweets were quickly deleted. But then, Elon Musk’s account tweeted “hi” after his initial tweet with the scam was deleted. The “hi” tweet also disappeared.

Twitter users reported seeing error messages on the platform as the situation went on. TechCrunch reporter Natasha Mascarenhas saw this error (see below) when she tried to create a threaded tweet. TechCrunch reporter Sarah Perez saw a similar error when trying to post a normal tweet. Both have verified accounts.

As the issues continued, many verified Twitter users also reported being unable to tweet. Around 3:15 p.m. PT, the official Twitter Support account confirmed “[Users] may be unable to Tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident.” By Wednesday evening, Twitter said that most tweeting should be back to normal but functionality “may come and go” as the company “continue[s] working on a fix.”

Most accounts should be able to Tweet again. As we continue working on a fix, this functionality may come and go. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 16, 2020

Who was hacked

It became clear early on that this situation was not the case of a single account being compromised as we’ve seen in the past, but something else altogether. Even Apple, a company known for robust security, somehow fell victim to the scheme.

Many high profile accounts were quickly hijacked in rapid succession Wednesday afternoon, including @elonmusk, the eccentric Twitter-obsessed tech figure with a notoriously engaged fanbase. A scam tweet posted to the Tesla and SpaceX founder’s account simply directed users to send bitcoin to a certain address under the guise that he will “double any payment” — a known cryptocurrency scam technique. Musk’s account appeared to remain compromised for some time after the initial message, with follow-up posts claiming followers were sending money to the suspicious address.

Some Democratic political figures were also hacked as part of the cryptocurrency scam, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg. An official from the Biden campaign told TechCrunch that Twitter locked down the former vice president’s account “immediately” after it was compromised and the campaign remains in close contact with Twitter on the issue. At the time of writing, no accounts belonging to Republican politicians appear to have been hacked.

Wiz Khalifa’s account was also compromised, as was the Twitter account of popular YouTuber MrBeast, who often posts giveaways, making his re-post of the bitcoin address particularly likely to drive followers to the scam.

The hack also hit legendary investor Warren Buffet, a prominent and harsh critic of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “I don’t have any cryptocurrency and I never will,” Buffet told CNBC in February.

Unusual hack, common scam

While the scope of Wednesday’s Twitter hack is unprecedented on the social network, the kinds of scams the hacked accounts promoted are common. Scammers take over high-profile Twitter accounts using breached or leaked passwords and post messages that encourage users to post their cryptocurrency funds to a particular address under the guise that they’ll double their “investment.” In reality, it’s simple theft, but it’s a scam that works.

The main blockchain address used on the scam site had already collected more than 12.5 bitcoin — some $116,000 in USD — and it’s going up by the minute.

A spokesperson for Binance told TechCrunch: “The security team is actively investigating the situation of this coordinated attack on the crypto industry.” Several other companies affected by the account hacks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s not immediately known how the account hacks took place. Security researchers, however, found that the attackers had fully taken over the victims’ accounts, and also changed the email address associated with the account to make it harder for the real user to regain access.

Scammers frequently reply to high-profile accounts, like celebrities and public figures, to hijack the conversation and hoodwink unsuspecting victims. Twitter typically shuts these accounts down pretty fast.

A Twitter spokesperson, when reached, said the company was “looking into” the matter but didn’t immediately comment.

This story is developing. Stay tuned for updates.

Below are screenshots of some of the hacked accounts.

The scam began when several high-profile cryptocurrency Twitter accounts were compromised and posted malicious links.

Dozens of high-profile verified accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Kim Kardashian West, and Elon Musk — which seemed to be compromised by hackers — posted tweets claiming they would double people's contributions of $1,000 in bitcoin.

The bitcoin account linked in the scam tweets appeared to have racked up over $100,000 within an hour of the tweets starting to be posted online, though scammers are known to transfer their own money into accounts to make them appear more legitimate.

Twitter said it temporarily disabled features, including tweeting, from accounts as it investigated the hacks.

Twitter said in a statement the company was aware of a ""security incident"" and ""investigating"" what happened.

""We all feel terrible this happened,"" CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday evening.

Later Wednesday evening, Twitter announced that it had detected ""what we believe to be a coordinated attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.""

Dozens of high-profile Twitter accounts were apparently hacked Wednesday as part of a cryptocurrency scam. This included the accounts of the billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mike Bloomberg, and Warren Buffett, as well as numerous tech startups and cryptocurrency-related sites. The Twitter accounts of former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were also compromised.

The affected accounts posted messages urging their followers to send $1,000 in bitcoin to a specific address, promising to double the contributions in return. The messages appear to employ a common scam tactic used to fleece people out of money by falsely promising to send a bigger sum in return for a payment.

Several of the scam tweets were deleted shortly after they were posted, only for similar tweets to come out of the accounts minutes later.

Later in the evening, the company said it had uncovered ""what we believe to be a coordinated engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools."" Those with access to those tools, ""ostensibly Twitter employees,"" can reset email addresses associated with accounts, as TechCrunch reported.

""Our investigation continues and we hope to have more to share there soon,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider.

As hacks persisted, Twitter appeared to temporarily disable verified accounts from tweeting shortly after 6:15 p.m. ET. Twitter said in a subsequent tweet that while it investigated the incident, it would ""limit the ability to Tweet, reset your password, and some other account functionalities.""

""Tough day for us at Twitter. We all feel terrible this happened,"" CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted about the incident Wednesday evening. ""We're diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.""

The scam messages started to pop up shortly after malicious links were tweeted from Twitter accounts for several high-profile cryptocurrency companies, including KuCoin, Binance, and Gemini, the MalwareTech blog said. The website used in the links, titled CryptoForHealth, was pulled offline shortly after the tweets were posted.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tried to warn his followers that the tweets were a scam shortly after they were posted, The Block first reported — but his account was apparently also compromised, and hackers quickly hid the warning.

Twitter accounts for CoinDesk and Gemini were also compromised. Both companies said on Twitter they had multifactor authentication enabled on their accounts, meaning hackers were able to bypass traditional login attempts, perhaps through an exploit in Twitter itself.

After hitting cryptocurrency-related companies and outlets, the hackers also accessed the accounts of billionaires and philanthropists, tech companies, music artists, and presidential hopefuls. Hackers also hit influential social-media figures including MrBeast, Kim Kardashian West, and the Twitter personality @TheTweetOfGod.

Bitcoin-transaction receipts appeared to show that the address listed in the scam tweets received almost 13 bitcoins — or about $118,000 — as of Wednesday evening, but it's possible that some or all of the transactions were carried out by the scammers to make their account appear more legitimate.

And yet, the verified Twitter accounts of Elon Musk, big tech companies, and major cryptocurrency exchanges were all promising that very thing Wednesday in what appears to be yet another iteration of the oldest scam in the relatively young crypto-scam book. Twitter accounts belonging to Musk, Bill Gates, Apple, Uber, Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Kraken, and Binance's CEO CZ all tweeted links to a site claiming to be giving away bitcoin — all you had to do was send a little its way, first.

""I'm feeling generous because of Covid-19,"" read the now-deleted tweet from Musk's account. ""I'll double any BTC payment set to my BTC address for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!""

Other, similarly scam tweets, had slightly different text but the same gist.

""We have partnered with CryptoForHealth and are giving back 5000 BTC,"" read one version of the scam.

Notably, as of the time of this writing, some of the accounts had removed the scam giveaway. Others, like @CZ_binance, had not.

Don't fall for it. Image: screenshot / twitter

We reached out to both Twitter to confirm that these verified accounts were indeed hacked, and to ask if some third-party account management platform was at fault. In 2019, the Twitter account of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was compromised via a third-party service called CloudHopper. We received no immediate response.

We also reached out to Coinbase for comment, but likewise did not immediately hear back.

If someone did happen to click on the cryptoforhealth.com link (and please, do not), they would be taken to a website purporting to offer cryptocurrency payouts.

""To participate you just need to send from ~0.1 BTC to 20 BTC to the contribution address and we will immediately send you back 0.2 BTC to 40 BTC to the address you sent it from (x2 back),"" promises the site.

It's a trap. Image: screenshot / scam site

As of the time of this writing, 20 bitcoin equals approximately $184,104. Unfortunately, it looks like real people have fallen for the scam — sending around 4.6 BTC to the scammer's address as of the time of this writing.

In the past, scammers have set up lookalike accounts in the hopes of tricking users into sending cryptocurrency their way. Now, it seems, they've done one better — take over the real deal.

UPDATE: July 15, 2020, 1:51 p.m. PDT: Twitter has apparently not been able to resolve the issue, and Musk's account is still tweeting scam links.

The London-based company launched its debit card in the U.S. in March, but some of the advanced features, including cryptocurrency trading, were absent.

Now, through a partnership with Paxos, Revolut offers users in 49 U.S. states (Tennesee is excluded) the ability to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in one step. Users can store their cryptocurrency in the app and cash out instantly, whenever they want. There are no hidden fees when purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies; the exchange rate shown is exactly the rate at which the coins are converted.

Revolut's version of storing cryptocurrency is not quite the same as holding it in a non-custodian wallet, as users can only send crypto to other Revolut users. I've checked with Revolut, and a company spokesperson confirmed via e-mail that customers cannot currently transfer their cryptocurrencies to an external wallet. This, however, ""is a focus for the product team going forward,"" he told me.

Other features include being able to round up your card payments to the nearest whole dollar and automatically convert that spare change into cryptocurrency.

Revolut offers access to more cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and XRP, in Europe. The company says it will provide access to other coins in the ""near future,"" in the U.S. as well.

Revolut's feature set is still richer in Europe, where the company offers three debit card tiers (Standard, Premium and Metal) vs. only two in the United States, for example. This should change soon. The spokesperson told me that the company is working on introducing numerous new features to the U.S. market, including commission-free stock trading, commodities trading, rewards and cash-back incentives, and business accounts.

As far as adoption goes, he told me that the company currently has more than 120,000 customers in the U.S.

Revolut launched in 2016, attaining more than 10 million customers globally with a combo of low fees, aggressive marketing and a rich set of features. Revolut's mobile app consolidates a debit card, a bank account, a trading account for stocks, cryptocurrencies and commodities, travel insurance and more. The company's latest round of funding came in February, when Revolut raised $500 million at a $5.5 billion valuation.

The startup is slowly catching up with features that are available in the U.K. and Europe. This time, Revolut is adding cryptocurrency trading through a partnership with Paxos.

Users in the U.S. can now buy, hold and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum from the Revolut app. The feature is going to be available in 49 states as there are some regulatory issues in Tennessee. If you have USD or other currencies in your Revolut account, you can exchange manually whenever you want.

You can also set up alerts in case there are some important price changes happening. Optionally, users can also round up card payments to the nearest whole dollar and convert spare change into crypto assets.

If you’re familiar with Revolut’s cryptocurrency feature, you know that the company gives you access to more cryptocurrencies in Europe, such as Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and XRP. The company says it is starting with BTC and ETH in the U.S. but is already working on bringing more cryptocurrencies.

When it comes to fees, users with a free Revolut account will pay 2.5% in conversion fees. Users with a Premium and Metal subscription will pay 1.5% in fees. Revolut is waving fees for the first 30 days.

This is in line with the company’s current fees in Europe. Revolut also has some monthly limits on currency exchange in general for free users as well — it can be fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies. You have to pay a 0.5% fee above that limit or pay for a subscription.

Revolut made some changes to its cryptocurrency feature recently. While you now technically own your cryptocurrencies, you can’t send and receive cryptocurrencies from third-party wallets. The feature is all about trading — buying, holding and selling.

In the U.S., Square’s Cash App and Robinhood also let you buy cryptocurrencies in their respective apps. While those features don’t offer the same flexibility as a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange, it makes it easy to get started with cryptocurrencies.",2020-07-15 00:00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/71636/revolut-teams-up-with-paxos-to-launch-crypto-service-in-the-us-and-it-points-to-broader-trends-in-the-fintech-space,"Count this as the latest sign that fintech companies see cryptocurrency as a promising way to expand their business.

European fintech unicorn Revolut announced Wednesday that it is set to enter the U.S. market, offering crypto trading services in the country via a platform that also spans stock trading and checking account services in Europe. But unlike rivals like Bitstamp and eToro, which recently ventured into the U.S., Revolut is partnering up with Paxos in a move that might set the foundation for other fintech firms to dive into the market.

As part of the U.S. launch, New York-based Paxos will serve as the backbone of Revolut's crypto trading offering. While Revolut will handle the front-end experience for clients, Paxos Crypto Brokerage will manage the underlying regulatory and technical complexity, as noted in a press release. As such, Revolut will have access to the full range of jurisdictions that Paxos is able to serve via its New York trust license. On the liquidity front, Revolut won't have to worry about setting up relationships with market makers or exchanges to source cryptocurrency for its retail clients.

Revolut — which counts its active crypto clientele in Europe above 1 million — is the first client of Paxos' new offering. The launch of crypto services has historically been a boon for fintech companies, in terms of both growth and valuations, as indicated by Zabo in its recent research report. Following the launch of crypto services by Robinhood in the U.S. and Revolut in Europe, the respective valuations of both companies soared, per the report. However, it's worth noting that such relationships might not be causal — early fintech companies expand their product suite and then grow further.

Soon after its 2018 rollout, Robinhood said that more than 1 million customers signed up for Robinhood Crypto within the first week of its launch. Square also reported success with the launch of bitcoin buys and sells on its Cash App, powering more than $300 million in bitcoin sales in the first quarter of 2020.

""You look at the crazy success of Robinhood and you think, why haven't more folks done it,"" said Alex Treece, co-founder of Zabo. ""There are operational and regulatory barriers, but in many cases, it comes down to mindset. People are hanging on to old narratives about crypto and bitcoin and that mindset penetrates to the upper echelons of those organizations.""

Paxos co-founder and CEO Chad Cascarilla told The Block in an interview that a wide range of clients are interested in leveraging the firm's infrastructure to launch crypto services, adding that the ease would make it a no-brainer for a firm looking to expand its client base.

""Blockchain is open to anyone so anyone can interact with it and build on it, but you can get up and running very easily in a low touch, lightweight way,"" he said of the new offering.

The company said it is prepared to scale its own internal exchange itBit to reliably serve clients — ranging from banks to fintechs–with their own client-bases topping the tens of millions and the hundreds of millions.

From the perspective of a fintech client, Revolut head of crypto Ed Cooper told The Block in an interview that Paxos' business model makes a lot of sense given the demand for crypto services.

""When there is a gold rush, sell spades,"" he said. Cooper said Revolut plans to differentiate by allowing U.S. users to invest in crypto via its spare change round-up service.

Jonathan Mayers, who spent the past decade as an in-house lawyer at hedge fund Renaissance Technologies LLC, joined BlockFi earlier this month as its first-ever general counsel. Mayers is the latest in a string of lawyers hired in the cryptocurrency and digital asset management sector, which is ramping up its legal and compliance capabilities in an effort to legitimize itself among regulators and traditional financial services institutions.

“As the space continues to mature, we’ll need a firm regulatory structure more analogous to that of traditional finance to ensure capital can move through the crypto ecosystem safely and ethically,” BlockFi co-founder and CEO Zac Prince said in a statement announcing Mayers’ hire. “Jonathan brings a trove of experience from some of the most recognized names in finance to help us continue to do so.”

Launched in August 2017, Jersey City, N.J.-based BlockFi operates a cryptocurrency trading and lending platform that is poised to generate $50 million in revenue this year, according to the company, which began searching for an in-house legal chief in May.

Mayers said in an interview that he couldn’t pass up the “tantalizing opportunity” to get involved “almost at the ground level” in a company operating in the cryptocurrency arena. The Covid-19 pandemic has not only contributed to a spike in hiring, but created an increased appetite for digital assets as more traditional investments falter, Mayers said.

Mayers spent four years in-house at banking giants Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG prior to joining Renaissance, an East Setauket, N.Y.-based hedge fund known for its quantitative modeling founded by mathematician and billionaire investor James Simons. Mayers left Renaissance in 2017 and co-founded Cape Springs Capital Partners LLC, a private equity firm that he said has switched from pursuing controlling stakes in small and mid-sized businesses to more passive investments.

While Cape Springs remains a going concern, Mayers told Bloomberg Law that since joining BlockFi two weeks ago he’s been busy getting up to speed on the legal and compliance framework at his new employer. The company in February raised $30 million in a second found of fundraising led by Thiel-backed venture capital firm Valar Ventures LLC.



Betting on BlockFi

Thiel, a former associate at Sullivan & Cromwell, has roots in South Africa, where Mayers was born and raised. But it was BlockFi chief risk officer Rene van Kesteren who Mayers said recruited him to the company.

Bloomberg News has reported that BlockFi’s backers include Winklevoss Capital Management LLC, the family office of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, best known for their legal battle with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg. Other investors include Fidelity Investments-owned Avon Ventures, hedge fund manager and noted cryptocurrency investor Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Ventures LLC, and Morgan Creek Capital Management LLC’s Morgan Creek Digital.

While cryptocurrencies still have their fair share of critics, some longtime skeptics have started to come around to the business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017, but two years later his company started its own cryptocurrency, JPM Coin.

“There are real efficiencies and benefits to digital assets,” Mayers said. “We want to get stakeholders involved and engage with global regulators in a responsible way.”

Mayers, who is working from his home with two small children in Hillsdale, N.Y., a task he cautioned is “not for the faint of heart,” said he hopes to be able to help BlockFi navigate an evolving legal and regulatory compliance landscape for cryptocurrency companies. Mayers lives not far from Robert Werner, the new legal chief at the Libra Association, a digital currency group grappling with its own regulatory issues whose members include Facebook.

Haynes and Boone and Gunderson Dettmer are the two law firms that primarily serve as outside counsel to BlockFi. Mayers, who began his U.S. legal career as an associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell, which he joined at the height of the dotcom boom two decades ago, doesn’t anticipate any immediate changes to that lineup, noting that he and BlockFi have been pleased with the advice they’ve received.

Mayers said Gemini Trust Co. LLC, a digital currency exchange also backed by the Winklevoss brothers, is a separate entity from BlockFi, although the latter does use New York-based Gemini as the primary custodian for its cryptocurrency assets.",,https://www.coindesk.com/disgraced-political-lobbyist-jack-abramoff-pleads-guilty-aml-bitcoin-ico-fraud,"Disclosure

For their efforts, the scammers received over 400 payments in bitcoin, with a total value of $121,000 at Thursday's exchange rate, according to an analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain performed by Elliptic, a cryptocurrency compliance firm.

Victims included Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Accounts for those people, and others, posted tweets asking followers to send bitcoin to a specific anonymous address.

On Wednesday, the Twitter accounts of some of the most famous people in the country were compromised as part of an apparent bitcoin scam .

""Given the scale of the compromise I don't think that's very much, but what we often see with these type of exploits is that the exploit itself can be very sophisticated but they're not very good at monetizing it,"" Robinson said.

The scammers posted three separate bitcoin addresses and one address for the cryptocurrency Ripple, which didn't receive any transactions, Robinson said.

The largest transaction received by the scammers was one payment of about $42,000, which could be traced back to a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, Robinson told CNBC.

CNBC could not verify who sent the bitcoin or if all of the money was proceeds from the scam. It's possible the scammers sent money to their own wallet to make their con look more successful.

Robinson said the people who fell for the racket were ""a strange segment.""

""It's people who are sophisticated enough to have crypto in the first place because otherwise they probably wouldn't have been able to make the payments in that short period of time, but also not crypto sophisticated enough to recognize the scam,"" Robinson said.

Shortly after the wallet started receiving funds, it started transferring them to different addresses. Robinson says that the scammers are probably doing this to ""cash out."" There could be benefits to moving fast before exchanges where cryptocurrency can be traded for cash or other coins block the addresses, he said.

Gemini, a major U.S. exchange, said it blacklisted the affected bitcoin addresses on Wednesday.

The scam tweets posted on Wednesday are similar to past scam tweets asking for bitcoin, with one major difference: The attackers were able to post them from compromised verified accounts with lots of followers.

Elon Musk's Twitter account was the first high-profile account to post a bitcoin tweet. Crypto scammers have targeted Musk in the past by creating dummy accounts that emulate Musk's account name and profile picture. They use those dummy accounts and reply to Tesla or SpaceX tweets asking for bitcoin.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-scams-on-twitter-are-nothing-newand-they-work-185935185.html,"Twitter fell victim to a coordinated hack on Wednesday that targeted the accounts of prominent users with big followings, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Kanye West, and sent out tweets from their accounts asking for bitcoin. One sample tweet, sent from Biden’s account, promised: “All bitcoin sent to the below address will be sent back doubled!”

Twitter (TWTR) will have to answer for the hack, and the FBI is now investigating as well. According to Vice, the hack was carried out by an employee inside Twitter, who was paid to help the hackers by using an internal tool that changed the email address associated with the compromised accounts. Twitter on Wednesday night said the hack was a “coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”

But cryptocurrency scams on Twitter are nothing new, and they have targeted prominent accounts in the past.

The problem became rampant on Twitter in late 2017, when bitcoin was on a wild price ride.

Bots promoting cryptocurrency “giveaways” would reply in droves to legitimate tweets from major tech figures like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, or Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. The bot accounts would have the same photo and display name as the real person; the only way to tell it was fake was from checking the handle. These tweets would promise free bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) if users would send crypto to a wallet address. (“As a thank you to my followers, I’m giving away 500 ETH! Click here! Just send 20 BTC to this address and we will immediately send back 40 BTC.”)

Elon Musk, in particular, was targeted incessantly, and tweeted in July 2018 that he wanted to know who was responsible for the scams, though he misspelled Ethereum.

Crypto scams on Twitter became so pervasive for a time that many crypto influencers on Twitter added “not giving away ETH” to their Twitter display names.

Story continues

In August 2018, the spam bots even targeted President Trump, replying to his tweets so that the spam tweets would nest below his real tweets. During the same period, spammers also hacked the accounts of real people with big followings, including the band Bad Religion and NBA player Monte Morris, and turned their accounts into fake Trump accounts.

A hacked Twitter account, belonging to British rugby star Joe Joyce and taken over to look like President Trump's account, promotes a crypto scam on Aug. 1, 2018.

You might think the spam tweets look so clearly fake that no one would fall for them, but people do.

This latest crypto scam on Wednesday resulted in at least 12.5 bitcoin being sent to the wallet address shared in the spam tweets. That comes out to about $114,500 at the current bitcoin price, which isn’t a lot considering that the compromised Twitter accounts had a collective 346 million followers, but it isn’t nothing.

Twitter, in the past, has said on the issue, “We are aware of this form of manipulation and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner” but has been criticized for not weeding out the problem effectively enough.

This time, after a much more sinister example in which important accounts were compromised, Twitter will face far more public pressure to put a stop to such scams. The hack will also bring more scrutiny on CEO Jack Dorsey, a big bitcoin believer himself, who may not be able to pull double duty as CEO of both Twitter and Square for much longer.

There is no such thing as getting rich quick. But times are tough, and people are desperate. Tell the powerless that there’s a magic trick to winning that the big guys aren’t telling you about, and you’ll get them in—or enough of them to be worth trying. And that’s particularly easy on a platform like Twitter, which mixes worryingly weak security with massive reach. It’s even easier when you throw in Bitcoin; its pool of adherents who have long mixed credulity, scamming, and a near-magical belief in the cryptocurrency’s policies; and Twitter’s long-standing tolerance for those scams.

On Wednesday afternoon, multiple accounts on Twitter began posting the same message: Send bitcoins to the address in the tweet, and you’ll get back double the bitcoins! Initial tweets claimed to be linked to a fake charity, Crypto for Health.

The first wave of scam tweets went out from small Twitter accounts and then cryptocurrency CEOs. A second wave went out from celebrities and politicians with Twitter accounts that had been verified as authentic—including Elon Musk, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama. Donald Trump wasn’t hit, as his account has extra protections after previous attacks.

Twitter seemed powerless to stop the tweets; for a short time, the platform even disabled all verified accounts. Eventually, the perpetrator was found to be working via compromised Twitter employee accounts, using an internal administrative console that was widely accessible inside the company. Twitter said it would be restricting access to the tool in question.

All scams are old scams. The words “double your money” are perfectly designed to catch the eye of the gullible. These days, money moves at the speed of light. So the scams work as a widely spammed numbers game: If you come up with something that looks like an obvious scam, only the gullible respond.

Bitcoin was designed to be unstoppable electronic money, with no central controller. Nobody can stop you sending your bitcoins anywhere you want to, and transactions are irreversible by design—a feature that was argued to be one of Bitcoin’s advantages.

Bitcoin doublers have been around since bitcoins could first be exchanged for real money—and earlier versions of the doubling scam ran in online games, such as “ISK doublers” in Eve Online or “coin doublers” in RuneScape. Send in a small amount of bitcoins, and you’ll get double the coins back! Send a larger amount straight after, and you won’t.

No reason is given for why anyone would just double your money. You’d think people would catch on, but, years later, this scam keeps popping up and finding suckers.

After the scam runs for the first time, there’s often a second layer: The doubler never sends back coins. But the doubling site is publicized with a “warning” about the scam. Others think: “If I only send coins once, the site will never see me as a repeat user!” They send in a small amount of coins—and never get anything back, even once. Like all the best scams, it’s a scam that relies on the sucker thinking they’re the scammer.

Fraud, crime, and ransomware make up a significant part of all Bitcoin usage. A payment channel having substantial—and, worse yet, famous—criminal usage is a serious problem. Many banks are reluctant even to let Bitcoin users bank with them because dirty money is pervasive in the crypto-trading system, with no easy way to sort out what’s clean. E-Gold, which let you quickly send dollars online, did not verify account holders’ identities—and became famous for criminal use, eBay auction fraud, and internet-based Ponzi schemes. E-Gold was shut down in 2007, and the founder pleaded guilty to unlicensed money transmission and conspiracy to engage in money laundering.

But more worrying than Bitcoin’s problems are Twitter’s. The social media platform has let coin doubling scams for Ethereum, another prominent cryptocurrency, run rampant for the past few years. Tweet with an avatar and a display name imitating some famous person, saying you’ll double people’s ether. Add some replies thanking the famous person for the money. These could pull in up to $5,000 a day in ether. Ethereum’s creator, Vitalik Buterin, eventually added “Not giving away ETH” to his Twitter display name for a time.

Elon Musk has long been another favorite target—to the point where Twitter would stop users from changing their display name to “Elon Musk.” One 2018 Musk scam pulled in $180,000 in bitcoins.

Twitter has been slow to move on these scams in the past. But arguably it got lucky this time around because this Bitcoin hacker was so startlingly unimaginative. The hacker took control of an administrative panel giving full control over almost every account on Twitter’s service. They could post anything they liked to hugely popular verified Twitter accounts, for important and powerful people. The hacker could have influenced markets and politics with carefully applied tweets—and the first thing they did with this power was to run a Bitcoin scam.

In 2013, an attacker took over the Associated Press Twitter account and posted that the White House had been bombed and Barack Obama injured and Wall Street flash-crashed. The present attacker could have hit just Musk’s account and crashed and short-sold Tesla stock, obscured among all the other Tesla short-sellers.

The present Twitter scammer used this amazing power to make approximately $110,000 worth of bitcoins—as visible on the public Bitcoin blockchain, which shows all transactions. This is assuming that the scammer didn’t recirculate bitcoins into the scam, to make it look as though coins were being sent in and double the coins were then sent out. Even a fake charity tweet asking for wire transfers would have netted more than the hacker managed.

Some speculated that the attack was the hacker marketing themselves, by demonstrating what they could do. But burning their own attack mechanism in a way that makes international news—and that hit the sort of people who have a Secret Service detail, thus attracting the utmost attention of the authorities—suggests instead that the hacker was just not very bright. Throw in the possibility of law enforcement using Bitcoin’s open transactions to help trace the thieves, as happened in the Silk Road case, and the chance that this is somebody who got lucky, rather than an unknown genius, is high.

Scams are a natural byproduct of Bitcoin. The real issue is Twitter’s responsibility. Twitter has been asked previously to block cryptocurrency addresses from being tweeted, which would have nipped the scam in the bud. Twitter has acknowledged it allowed far too many employees full access to an all-powerful administrative console. This was a systemic failure.

Other people’s personal data requires controls as strong as the controls on other people’s money. Twitter now has to earn back the trust of the verified celebrity posters it relies on to lure mundane users to the platform—and of politicians, who are already asking pointed questions. Twitter must review its internal controls and release a full root cause analysis. Government services that use Twitter, which in the United States now span from the presidency on down to local police forces and fire departments, need to rethink how they approach the platform if it doesn’t show massive improvement. Wednesday’s shenanigans, for instance, locked down a local National Weather Service account—in the middle of a tornado warning.

The Bitcoin subculture is as certain as ever that any publicity is good publicity. Tyler Winklevoss, of The Social Network fame, and his brother run the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, whose Twitter account was one of those compromised. Winklevoss tweeted: “Bitcoin is trending.” Never mind that it was trending because of massive fraud.

Twitter can’t afford to be as delusional. This disaster could have ended the company. It was lucky to have such an attacker so unimaginatively committed to a deeply fraudulent currency this time. It can’t expect to be so lucky next time.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/market-outlook-crypto-economy-sheds-10b-overnight-exchange-inflow-and-sell-pressure-rises/,"Market Outlook: Crypto Economy Sheds $10B Overnight, Exchange Inflow and Sell Pressure Rises

The overall market capitalization of all 5,700+ cryptocurrencies in existence lost around $10 billion during the overnight trading sessions. Most crypto assets have lost 2-5% in value during the last 12 hours, and a number of speculators blame the recent Twitter hack.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) and a number of other digital assets worldwide slumped in value, a few hours after the massive Twitter breach that took place on Wednesday. Since the incident, the overall valuation of all the coins in existence has lost roughly $10 billion and most of the top coins are down a few percentages. At the time of publication, the market capitalization for every coin market is hovering just above the $270 billion range losing 1.47% during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) is swapping for $9,083 per coin and the market is down 1.56% today. The second-largest market ethereum (ETH) has lost over 3% and each ETH is trading for $232. The stablecoin tether (USDT) is capturing more than two-thirds of the global trades today with nearly every coin as a pair. The USDT market valuation is hovering around $9.64 billion on Thursday and there’s roughly $5.9 billion in global trade volume.

Behind USDT, is XRP and each token is currently trading for $0.19 per coin. XRP has lost over 3.6% during the last 24 hours. Bitcoin cash (BCH) holds the fifth position as far as market valuation is concerned. BCH is swapping for $221 per coin and markets are down over 2.9%. USDT/BCH trades are hovering just above the 58% zone, while BTC is capturing 21% of all bitcoin cash swaps. This is followed by KRW (4.88%), USD (4.82%), GBP (2.74%), ETH (1.41%), and EUR (1.07%).

Selling Pressure and Bitcoin Options

According to a recent tweet from the popular Twitter account @cl207, the range of bid and asks (sellers) is at a “multi-month high.” On July 15, cl207 told his 9,800 Twitter followers: “3% range bids/asks shows that the amount of asks on Bitmex is at a Bitmex multi-month high.” Essentially, it means the price of bitcoin (BTC) has a great number of sell orders to eat through in order to break upper resistance. He added:

Eat through approximately $150,000,000 of sell orders to and we won’t even be at $9,400.

Additionally, data from the market research firm Skew.com indicates that BTC options show traders are expecting a temporary dip. Data from the web portal shows that bitcoin options, specifically one-month put-calls, are leaning toward a bearish downswing in price. On Twitter Skew wrote: “Bitcoin options term structure is record steep. Market pricing-in a quiet summer.” The research team’s official Twitter account also tweeted:

Yesterday is the first day on our record where Okex USDT-margined bitcoin futures had more volumes than BTC-margined bitcoin futures. The shift towards stable coin margining is a big story for crypto markets this year.

Stablecoin Madness

Stablecoins have been extremely popular during the last two years, and the current supply recently crossed $12 billion in value, according to a recent tweet from the cryptocurrency analysis firm Unfolded. Sharing data from the company Coin Metrics, the Unfolded researchers highlighted a quote from a recent Coin Metrics report: “After it took five years for stablecoin supply to reach $6 billion, it only took another four months for it to grow from $6 billion to $12 billion following the March 12th crypto crash.”

Bitstamp and Coin Metrics published a report recently called “The Rise of Stablecoins,” which highlights that tether (USDT) captures a great majority of the $12 billion aggregate stablecoin valuation.

“As crypto matures, stablecoins will mature as well,” the researchers wrote. “If crypto assets are eventually used at a large scale for purposes like international payments and global remittances, stablecoins are a natural candidate for a true crypto medium of exchange.”

Traders Expect a Bitcoin Price Dip Due to Exchange Inflow Metrics

Data from the research and analysis company Cryptoquant and the popular full-time crypto trader on Twitter with 40,000 followers, “Traderxo” (@pandilladeflujo), shows that the price of BTC may see a temporary drop below the $9k range.

Cryptoquant notes that a “small” retracement may take place due to the spike in exchange inflows, which means a great number of traders are depositing coins to possibly sell. Traderxo noted the trend on July 15 when he tweeted:

Inflows showing constant spikes – and some decent amounts being sent to derivatives exchanges. Yet outflows remain relatively flat. Something, something on derivatives while something, something on spot exchanges. Its been a consistent pattern for the last several weeks.

The inaugural fork is only up 9% year to date.

Although most alternate cryptocurrencies (or “altcoins”) have rallied over the past few months, bitcoin cash – the only fork around today that traded throughout the 2017 cryptocurrency bull market – has been left behind. Bitcoin cash only started underperforming bitcoin in May, but two months was enough time for the forked cryptocurrency to underperform bitcoin by 18 percentage points so far this year.

It’s common for altcoins to outperform bitcoin during bullish market cycles. Altcoins with low or medium market capitalizations often experience higher volatility than bitcoin, which may yield higher returns should bitcoin’s price also appreciate.

Bitcoin cash, on the other hand, has simply experienced more of a volatility compression compared to the other forks, especially bitcoin sv, which has a market capitalization closest to bitcoin cash, said Dan Koehler, liquidity manager at OKCoin.

“Bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond remain in a much smaller market cap bucket and thus could be experiencing higher volatility and returns as a result,” he added.

The account hijacks hit some of the most prominent users on the social media platform, including leading cryptocurrency sites, but also ensnared several celebrity accounts, notably Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

Vice earlier on Wednesday reported details of the Twitter admin tool.

A Twitter spokesperson, when reached, did not comment on the claims. Twitter later confirmed in a series of tweets that the attack was caused by “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”

A person involved in the underground hacking scene told TechCrunch that a hacker, who goes by the handle “Kirk” — likely not their real name — generated over $100,000 in the matter of hours by gaining access to an internal Twitter tool, which they used to take control of popular Twitter accounts. The hacker used the tool to reset the associated email addresses of affected accounts to make it more difficult for the owner to regain control. The hacker then pushed a cryptocurrency scam that claimed whatever funds a victim sent “will be sent back doubled.”

The person told TechCrunch that Kirk had started out by selling access to vanity Twitter accounts, such as usernames that are short, simple and recognizable. It’s big business, if not still illegal. A stolen username or social media handle can go for anywhere between a few hundred dollars or thousands.

Kirk is said to have contacted a “trusted” member on OGUsers, a forum popular with traders of hacked social media handles. Kirk needed the trusted member to help sell stolen vanity usernames.

In several screenshots of a Discord chat shared with TechCrunch, Kirk said: “Send me @’s and BTC,” referring to Twitter usernames and cryptocurrency. “And I’ll get ur shit done,” he said, referring to hijacking Twitter accounts.

But then later in the day, Kirk “started hacking everything,” the person told TechCrunch.

Kirk allegedly had access to an internal tool on Twitter’s network, which allowed them to effectively take control of a user’s account. A screenshot shared with TechCrunch shows the apparent admin tool. (Twitter is removing tweets and suspending users that share screenshots of the tool.)

The tool appears to allow users — ostensibly Twitter employees — to control access to a user’s account, including changing the email associated with the account and even suspending the user altogether. (We’ve redacted details from the screenshot, as it appears to represent a real user.)

The person did not say exactly how Kirk got access to Twitter’s internal tools, but hypothesized that a Twitter employee’s corporate account was hijacked. With a hijacked employee account, Kirk could make their way into the company’s internal network. The person also said it was unlikely that a Twitter employee was involved with the account takeovers.

As part of their hacking campaign, Kirk targeted @binance first, the person said, then quickly moved to popular cryptocurrency accounts. The person said Kirk made more money in an hour than selling usernames.

To gain control of the platform, Twitter briefly suspended some account actions — as well as prevented verified users from tweeting — in an apparent effort to stem the account hijacks. Twitter later tweeted it “was working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.”",2020-07-15 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/irs-enlists-coinbase-in-latest-crypto-tracing-deal,"Disclosure

Importantly, Defi runs on accounts that are accessible to anyone in the world with an internet connection. They can store and transfer value and create and access any imaginable financial product on the same terms as anyone else. No banks. No brokers. No politics. All you need is an open source digital wallet you can download for free from your favorite app store.

Currently, the billion or so dollars tied up in DeFi pales in comparison to the trillions of dollars in traditional, centralized finance. But, the excitement of rapid growth and the possibility of meaningful investment returns in a low interest rate environment are starting to pull some real money away from traditional investment. Moreover, the largely unregulated space makes it easier to innovate and is attractive to individuals who feel like banks should be a little less stodgy given the taxpayer funded bailout of the great recession. Banks don't need to be afraid, but they would be foolish not to be paying attention.

Over the last month, Compound, the second most popular DeFi platform in terms of volume, increased its amount of assets under protocol (""AUP"") by 900 percent by ushering in a first of its kind governance model that cleverly incents users to its protocol by offering rewards denominated in ""Comp"" tokens which can then be used to exercise governance rights over the decentralized platform.

Not surprisingly, the governance token, has traded as high as seven times its issuance price, and its method of issuance likely gives the token instant utility on a decentralized platform. Utility, among other things, is a sought-after moniker because utility is one of the characteristics that tends to indicate the token is not subject to securities regulation in the US and elsewhere. Another popular decentralized exchange, Uniswap, had more trading volume in June of 2020 than it had for all of 2019.

There are enough new and exciting things going on in DeFi right now that it seems like a watershed moment. Cryptocurrencies as a whole are known for their volatility, and previous watershed moments have proven illusory -- witness the ICO boom in 2017-2018. Boom or bust, there are still some real winners in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin (BTC) (31%) and Ethereum (85%) have much better YTD gains than most traditional stocks and bonds. More important, DeFi has become a real financial system, albeit one used primarily by crypto insiders to make more crypto so that they can speculate on yet more crypto.

But out of the DeFi soup that is comprised of borrowers, lenders and speculators, there have arisen some novel and brilliant ideas, and those ideas are likely to become the sophisticated investment vehicles and strategies of tomorrow. The global financial services market is one of the most lucrative business opportunities anywhere, and if DeFi is really a FinTech sandbox, it has yielded some cool toys. Most Defi transactions are denominated in stablecoins, tokens whose value is tied to a particular asset or currency such as the U. S. dollar, to avoid unpredictable fluctuations in value.

Profits are made by lending stablecoins at rates set by market demand or by borrowing stablecoins through overcollateralized loans, usually to reinvest the borrowed proceeds. DeFi can accommodate pretty much every type of centralized financial instrument as traditional finance and often generates more favorable returns for smaller fees. Depositors (lenders) can earn interest upwards of 10% depending on the crypto asset deposited, and sophisticated users can leverage their positions through a series of borrowing and lending transactions.

The new Comp governance model has given rise to speculators (""Yield Farmers"") searching for the lending/borrowing token combinations that offer the best yield. Often the amount of interest earned or paid is less important than the amount of governance tokens one can earn by lending or borrowing (or both!). In the high risk DeFi environment, losses can be dramatic, but knowledgeable Yield Farmers can earn 100% annual percentage rate (""APR"") in a single day. Not surprisingly, the potential for huge gains has attracted a lot of new money to DeFi in the last couple weeks, hence the dramatic increase in the amount of assets under protocol (""AUP"").

All this new growth is likely to beget even more new growth. In addition to the predictable onslaught of governance token issuances like Comp, another asset class experiencing rapid growth is the category of tokens clamoring to bring Bitcoin to Ethereum (and thus into DeFi). BTC is far and away the greatest store of value among digital assets, but it's primary use, like gold, is limited to storing value. That is until now. Over the last several months, a number of tokens have started using smart contracts to allow the value of BTC to be represented in ERC20 tokens that can be traded on DeFi platforms. Such tokens allow serious holders of BTC to lend or borrow against their BTC holdings with what are essentially BTC-backed stablecoins instead of just holding them. As Defi continues to experience exponential growth, the sky is the limit regarding the addition of new investment plays and their derivatives.

So, what's the big deal about these new governance protocols, and why should we care? The new protocols and yield farming tokens are pushing DeFi into the mainstream. Many believe a substantial chunk of the new assets moving into DeFi are from institutional investors looking for high risk yields.

Institutional money usually avoids the taint of cryptocurrency investing, but in an era where centralized interest rates are moving into negative territory, there are not too many opportunities to earn dependable double digit returns or better, even for those willing to accept higher risk. Fifty to 100% daily APRs are not going to stay secret for long, and they're not going to last forever. Any investment fund, institutional or not, with a high risk tolerance that is not actively considering the DeFi markets is not doing its job.

Why should banks care? Because all of this investing and all of the cool new fintech instruments are being offered by non-banks. Traditional banks and investment houses should get on board or get left behind. I'm not saying invest houses should create their own blockchain protocols, but they should definitely be conversant in a new asset class with the potential of high returns and no bureaucracy. One of the most vocal early critics of bitcoin, JPMC's Jamie Dimon, was one of the first to harvest the power of blockchain through his JPM Coin which allows instantaneous financial transfers between institutional clients.

Let's be clear: DeFi carries significant risk. Many protocols are truly permissionless (decentralized) so there is no kill switch to shut down a platform if it starts to malfunction or becomes subject to an attack. Smart contract hacks still occur with some frequency, but several insurance carriers are stepping up to mitigate smart contract risk. Like traditional finance, the yield one earns is based largely on the amount of risk one is willing to take.

Undoubtedly, some rapid gains are the result of the inefficiency of early protocols. Yet some investors view DeFi investments as safer than ICO purchases because ICO valuations are often drawn from ether (pun intended) whereas DeFi returns, particularly yield farming returns, are incented by the value one receives by creating and using a new financial instrument. Instead of receiving value through the ownership of one or more tokens, DeFi investors create and receive value by helping to fuel and run the underlying DeFi protocol. In the current environment, they can also receive governance tokens for doing so which further incents them to safeguard the long-term health of the platform.

For the protocol, offering yields in the form of governance tokens is a clever way to drive rapid user adoption. Longer-term, the viability of the protocol will be determined by the degree to which it can hold the attention of its users in the face of future new and shiny fintech toys.

Key Takeaways The thesis holds that base blockchain will be more valuable than the sum of the applications built on top of it.

There are three ways this can play out: ERC-20 tokens correct, ETH pumps, or existing conditions continue and the theory is disproved.

Of particular interest to investors is the scenario where ETH pumps along with its application, as that creates room for unhinged growth.

A highly popular crypto-economic theory, which states that base layers are more valuable than the applications built on top of them, may soon fall out of fashion due to the booming DeFi market.

What Is the Fat Protocol Thesis?

In 2016, Joel Monegro, then a member of the blockchain investment team at Union Square Ventures (now a partner at Placeholder VC), introduced a crypto-economic theory called the “fat protocol thesis.”

This theory proposed that base layer blockchains, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, accrue more value than their corresponding application layers.

For example, this would mean that the total of all applications built on Bitcoin cannot have a market cap that exceeds that of Bitcoin.

Monegro’s rationalization of this theory in a public article looked at the top cryptoassets at the time.

Ethereum was just a couple of years old with no breakout use case in place, but it commanded a valuation of a billion dollars. This is eerily similar to current circumstances for nascent layer one networks like Cardano and Cosmos that are still in their active bootstrapping phase but are valued at $4 billion and $750 million, respectively.

Of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only six are on the application layer. In the top 10, this reduces to two projects, Chainlink and Tether, both of which are blockchain agnostic.

However, the current market cap of all ERC-20 tokens has now overtaken Ethereum’s market capitalization.

According to a spreadsheet created by Cami Russo, the total market cap of ERC-20 tokens is $33.2 billion. This number is closer to $29 billion after excluding Binance Chain and VeChain, both of which have transitioned away from Ethereum to their native blockchains.

Still, the total amount of ERC-20 tokens exceeds Ethereum’s $26.8 billion market cap. This figure excludes other tokens on Ethereum, such as ERC-777 and ERC-721 tokens.

Does this mean that Monegro’s thesis is no longer valuable? Not quite.

Redemption or Destruction of the Thesis

Three possible outcomes control the fate of the fat protocol thesis.

First, if the market cap of ERC-20 tokens starts to fall while ETH stagnates or declines, the thesis would be confirmed as the total market cap of Ethereum’s tokens falls below that of Ethereum.

Analysts could attribute the brief period where the market cap of ERC-20s exceeded that of Ethereum to euphoria on the application layer that got out of hand and turned into a mini-bubble. Mean reversion would kick into action and bring the value of Ethereum’s application layer closer to its mean, which is below Ethereum’s total market cap.

Second, the price of ETH could pump, causing its market cap to catch up with the application layer.

This is the preferred scenario for every market participant, as it creates more value on the path to efficiency, rather than eroding it. It also confirms the fat protocol thesis.

If ETH follows its application layer, it sets a precedent that the Ethereum’s total value is not a ceiling for application growth. Instead, as applications continue to prosper, they drag ETH along with it.

For every $1 of value created by Ethereum’s application, x% of that trickles down to ETH.

Further, this would cement the idea that token economics and adoption is the winning formula for a successful base layer. If teams build strong incentives on the base layer to create working applications and allow those applications to drip value into the base blockchain by funneling in more users, everyone wins.

Finally, if ETH stays stagnant, and the value of ERC-20 tokens continues to soar, the fat protocol thesis will be disproven.

However, for real confirmation of this, ERC-20 tokens need to be worth more than Ethereum over a much more extended period.

In the end, this would mean that ETH is just the base currency that powers the application layer, but demand is not high enough for it to form a symbiotic relationship with the products built on top of Ethereum.

This sets a negative precedent that the real money is on top of Ethereum and not Ethereum itself.

Such an outcome places the number two blockchain project in jeopardy, too. It could lead investors away from funding base layer improvements like scalability and security, and towards mooning altcoins.

Ultimately, the legitimacy of the fat protocol thesis is key to Ethereum’s continued dominance.

Hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts of executives including Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc. Founder Elon Musk, asking users to direct the cryptocurrency to one of three different accounts, said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which helps law enforcement agencies track bitcoin-related crime.

Bitcoin offers users a degree of anonymity, making it a popular vehicle for criminal behavior. But investigators can glean valuable information in cases where the cryptocurrency is moved to accounts, or wallets, that have carried out transactions with certain U.S. exchanges or services. That’s because U.S. exchanges typically take pains to verify user identity.

“Sharing this information fast with the authorities worldwide and with companies from the ecosystem, will help us stop the stolen funds and find more info about the attackers,” said Itsik Levy, co-founder of Whitestream, a Bitcoin researcher.

The attackers received just over 400 payments, valued at $121,000, according to Elliptic. The largest payment came from a Japan-based exchange, and totaled about $42,000.

Soon after they were initially collected in the three accounts, the funds started moving around. About $65,000 of the $120,000 quickly moved to other Bitcoin addresses, one of which has been active in the past and has transacted with a U.S. exchange, Robinson said.

Of the amount moved, about $60,000 was directed to a Bitcoin address that has been active since May, Whitestream said. That address had interacted with Coinbase Inc., the largest U.S. crypto exchange, as well as payment processors BitPay and CoinPayments, Whitestream said. Coinbase declined to comment. BitPay and CoinPayments didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

The money that was initially collected in three Bitcoin addresses has now been moved to 12 new addresses, according to Elliptic.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory Thursday saying crypto exchanges and other financial institutions should report any suspicious activities related to the hack as soon as possible. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the New York Department of Financial Services will investigate the incident, and, according to Reuters, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also on the case.

Discovering the perpetrators could still take time and prove challenging.

“It depends on what they do next, it depends on how they try to cash out,” Robinson said. If they try to use a regulated exchange in the U.S., finding them will be easy. But if they try to cash out through one of the hundreds of small, unregulated exchanges, that could be harder, he said.

“They are obviously sophisticated in that they didn’t send these funds directly to an exchange to cash out,” Robinson said.

About a quarter of the funds the hackers acquired came from accounts tied to North America, and more than 50% from accounts in Asia, according to Elliptic.

While bitcoin is supposed to be difficult to track, a number of tracing firms have sprung up to help law enforcement. Exchanges and other providers have begun collecting more information on their customers. So law enforcement agencies have been able to track stolen bitcoins many times in the past.

Aside from prominent political and business leaders, the attacks also affected many crypto companies like the Gemini exchange. The hacked accounts promised to double the amount of money sent to their Bitcoin address.

Coinbase has begun blocking its users’ payments sent to the hackers’ accounts. “We are essentially blacklisting addresses as we see them posted in the scam tweets,” said Elliott Suthers, a spokesman for Coinbase.

Gemini also blocked the attackers’ accounts, according to a Gemini spokesperson.

Another reason bitcoin is an attractive target for scammers is that it can be used worldwide. While the cryptocurrency’s price dropped at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has since recovered, and is up roughly 30% since the beginning of the year.

The more-than $110,000 that hackers collected on Wednesday after posing as prominent politicians and tech company CEOs, for example, will be ""next-to-impossible to recover,"" Muneeb Ali, founder of decentralized computing platform Blockstack, told FOX Business.

""While the movement of bitcoin funds can be traced on the public ledger, it will be next to impossible to recover the funds,"" Ali said. ""The bitcoin blockchain is permissionless, meaning that money can be sent to anyone in a way that cannot be clawed back. It's the digital version of physically reaching into your pocket, taking out cash, and handing it to another person.""

He added, however, that hackers have limited options when it comes to cashing out because exchanges that trade crypto for currencies like dollars or euros are monitoring the situation and will likely freeze the funds if they are moved to the top exchanges.

Additionally, victims of bitcoin fraud can hire support from companies or law firms that help people retrieve crypto funds lost to scams, but the sum should be worth the funds needed to hire such experts.

Crypto ATMs are machines that let individuals purchase and sell digital assets through cash, debit or credit cards or electronic wallets. These machines have been installed in various locations throughout Malaysia. They facilitate the exchange of various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), among many others, with fiat money and vice versa.

The Malaysian SC warned:

“The SC wishes to alert the public that entities operating Crypto ATMs are considered to be operating a Digital Asset Exchange (DAX) which requires registration with the SC. In this regard, the SC has not authorized any entity to operate Crypto ATMs.”

The SC also noted:

“As such, we wish to caution and remind members of the public not to deal with unlicensed or unauthorized entities or individuals. Those who do so are not protected under the Malaysian securities laws and are exposed to various risks, including fraud and money laundering.”

The SC went on to caution that all unauthorized Crypto ATM operators in the country must immediately suspend all their activities. The regulator warned that operating a DAX without authorization or a permit from the SC is considered an offense under the nation’s securities laws.

The agency confirmed that anyone convicted may be required to pay a fine “not exceeding RM10 million or imprisonment up to ten years or both.”

The SC further noted that members of the general public can verify if a crypto-asset operator has been registered with the SC here.

Investors have also been asked to inform the SC if they come across any suspicious or potentially fraudulent activities or websites. Malaysian residents may also notify the SC if they receive any unsolicited phone calls or emails that claim to offer any type of investment advice and opportunities, particularly those that offer “high returns with seemingly little or no risks.”

The cryptocurrency sector of finance has long been a hotbed for fraud, scams, hacks, and crimes. The relative anonymity (or perceived anonymity) along with the ability to seamlessly transfer value in seconds has been catnip for crooks.

Industry participants have struggled in the ongoing cat and mouse game as the bad guys adapt and find new methods of stealing other people’s money. The regulators, recognizing the opportunity for bad guys, have moved to more tightly regulate the sector – most recently with the FATF travel rule. The emergence of digital assets as a secure sector of Fintech is taking some time.

In June 2020, CipherTrace, a data and cyber-security firm entrenched in the crypto-asset sector, published a report quantifying the activities of crypto-criminals. In a document that covers the first 5 months of 2020, CipherTrace claims that nefarious activities have netted $1.36 billion and thus puts 2020 on track to be a banner year for the bad guys (perhaps topping 2019s $4.5 billion stolen).",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/wonder-woman-illustrator-and-british-artist-terry-flaxton-to-sell-ethereum-backed-art/,"'Wonder Woman' Illustrator and British Artist Terry Flaxton to Sell Ethereum-Backed Art

The non-fungible token (NFT) and blockchain-backed collectible economy continue to see demand and the digital art market Makerplace has seen enormous growth recently. A number of well known artists have started to participate, as work from the acclaimed comic book illustrator Jose Delbo and 4K video art from Terry Flaxton will be sold on the “premier market for rare digital art.”

Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on the growing blockchain-backed metaverse and the non-fungible token (NFT) evolution. In the report, it was discussed how the sales of blockchain-powered non-fungible token sales crossed the $100 million mark.

Not only is there more than 18,500 wallets on Opensea, the largest NFT marketplace, but another marketplace dubbed Makerplace is seeing a lot of attention from buyers and popular artists. Makerplace is essentially a market for blockchain-backed digital art collections. The website states:

Every digital creation available through Makersplace is an authentic and truly unique digital creation, signed and issued by the creator — made possible by blockchain technology. Even if the digital creation is copied, it won’t be the authentic and originally signed version.

One specific artist who will host artwork for sale on Makerplace is the British artist Terry Flaxton who is well known for his analog video content, photography, film, and sound composition work. Flaxton has held over 200 exhibitions globally and he will be selling a 4K video project called “Under Every Desert a Sea.”

Currently, there is a pending offer for one out of the ten Flaxton-created 4K videos being sold for 2.2 ETH ($512). Flaxton’s video on Makerplace is also linked through Opensea and the listing’s description says:

Under every Desert a Sea began its life with images of the Mojave desert that are now so abstracted they appear to be water.

Another well known artist who will be featured on Makersplace web portal will be the comic book illustrator who worked on the DC Comic “Wonder Woman” series from 1976 to 1981. The comic book artist Jose Delbo also worked on the “Thundercats,” “Transformers,” and “Brute Force” comics in the eighties and nineties for Marvel.

On July 23, 2020, Delbo will be selling a digital “Superman” drawing and a digital comic book as well. Reports note that Delbo will be answering questions about his digital work during an exhibition hosted in Decentraland.

The art scene worldwide is steadily transforming into an online art industry, and digital art sales are growing every year. At the current growth rate, blockchain and NFT markets like Makerplace and Opensea may someday outshine popular digital art venues like Redbubble, Artfinder, Artplode, Ugallery, and Saatchi Art.

In contrast to the traditional digital art marketplaces that have transpired during the last few years, markets like Opensea and Makerplace sell blockchain-based and NFT art with immutability.

Sales on both markets can be seen in real-time every day and people are spending their precious cryptocurrencies on digital art. For instance, a few pieces of digital art that recently sold on Makerplace include works like “Vandalism ($333),” “Rudbeckia ($153),” and a form of pixelated art called “Pxlpet – Not a Virus ($617).”

The ability to borrow funds, take out loans, deposit funds into a savings account, or trade complex financial products — all that without asking anyone for permission or opening an account anywhere — is quickly gaining traction. The amount of money locked into various DeFi services has recently surpassed $2 billion, according to DeFi Pulse, up from about $1 billion a month ago. But it's not just about the money — other assets are being sucked into the DeFi ecosystem.

Let's take a couple steps back. DeFi, which is built on cryptocurrency platforms such as Ethereum and Cosmos, cuts out human middlemen and paperwork, and replaces them with smart contracts. These are computer programs that run on decentralized blockchains, meaning they're near-impossible to stop or censor. If I borrowed money to someone via a smart contract, the terms built into the contract have to be obliged — no human can (typically) alter that.

Six months ago, I wrote an article describing how simple it has become to invest, loan, and borrow money using freely available DeFi services, in my case a mobile cryptocurrency wallet called Argent.

Since then, however, the number of services in the DeFi space, as well as overall use, have skyrocketed. The simple practice of borrowing a bit of crypto and generating a return seems innocent in comparison to the massive array of opportunities available today.

Tokenization of everything

One advancement that facilitated this change is tokenization. Tokens — essentially cryptocurrencies that run on a parent blockchain, like Ethereum — are smart contracts themselves. Tokens on Ethereum share many properties with Ethereum's currency, which is called ether or ETH. But they can be created with properties that make them similar to certain financial products and services. The most common example are stablecoins, which are tokens whose value closely tracks the value of a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency. USDC, TUSD and DAI track the dollar. EURS tracks the euro.

In the past year or so, an increasing number of external assets and financial products have been tokenized on Ethereum. Bitcoin, which by itself does not offer complex smart contract capabilities, is a valuable and highly liquid cryptocurrency asset. It is therefore being injected into DeFi by projects which, typically, lock actual bitcoins as collateral and produce Ethereum-based tokens which track the value of real bitcoins. Examples include WBTC and tBTC. Some 15,500 bitcoins are currently locked into BTC services, with a total value of more than $141 million.

BTC isn't natively compatible with DeFi services, but the tokenized versions of it are. Image: defipulse.com

Stablecoins and bitcoins on Ethereum are fairly simple to understand. But smart contracts allow for far more complex products to be created. For example, you can now go to Uniswap — a completely decentralized cryptocurrency exchange — and purchase sETH, which is a token that tracks the value of an ETH short (in trading, shorting is the practice of borrowing an asset and selling it, with the idea of buying it later at a lower price). The magic of this is that to actually short ETH, you'd typically have to sign up at an exchange, transfer some money there, and perform certain actions. But the sETH token abstracts all the steps into a token that you can purchase and simply hold in a cryptocurrency wallet. Its value goes up if the value of ETH goes down, making it really simple and accessible for anyone to short ETH.

Even more complex examples are some of the products offered by a cryptocurrency exchange called FTX, which include tokens that track Bitcoin volatility, or even some that let you bet on Trump's chances to win the 2020 election.

There's also a network effect at play, in which certain assets act as a foundation for other, more complex DeFi products. This is often referred to as composability — the ability to plug various DeFi services into one another to create new applications. Again, a good example for this are stablecoins, which serve as non-volatile collateral for various DeFi services.

A new bubble?

The relative ease with which new DeFi products and services can be created and offered to the market has caused a surge of interest, and some of it has the makings of a bubble.

The most egregious example of this is the practice of yield farming. DeFi products remove a lot of the friction that's present in finance. Also, anyone can create them and place them on the market, with no restrictions or oversight. Because of these factors, it wasn't long until certain DeFi services started offering extravagantly high returns on lending products. Then, other DeFi services were built on top of these, further increasing these returns by doing some fairly complex and — to a typical user — arcane wizardry in the background.

A site called DeFi Rate lists the typical lending interest rates for DeFi products. Right now, a platform called Nuo offers an 11.47 percent yearly return rate on USDC deposits, and Aave offers a 7 percent yearly return rate on DAI. If you're not very tech-savvy and/or privy to the inner workings of these systems, you probably won't know why one service can offer a premium over another. But a lot of users are focusing on the ones with the highest returns, which are typically associated with higher risks.

A 10 percent annual return on an asset that tracks the value of the U.S. dollar is nice, but if you dig deeper into more obscure products, you'll hear talk of yearly return rates going into hundreds of percents.

Honestly I think we emphasize flashy defi things that give you fancy high interest rates way too much. Interest rates significantly higher than what you can get in traditional finance are inherently either temporary arbitrage opportunities or come with unstated risks attached. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 20, 2020

DeFi service Compound caused a boom when it launched its COMP token in June. Users who provided liquidity to various Compound services would earn the COMP token as reward. Combined with borrowing and lending other products, one could employ their crypto capital to earn massive returns, which in turn caused the COMP token's value to skyrocket.

Massive returns on capital are almost never risk-free. Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin expressed his concern about these exorbitant return rates that can currently be found in DeFi.

""Interest rates significantly higher than what you can get in traditional finance are inherently either temporary arbitrage opportunities or come with unstated risks attached,"" he tweeted.

The risk has proven to be very real several times this year, with individuals abusing DeFi products to effectively steal funds. In June, a hacker drained approximately $500,000 from DeFi service Balancer. In April, $25 million was stolen from dForce.

For a deeper dive into the various DeFi products currently on offer, as well as some of the risks attached, check out Consensys' latest Ethereum DeFi Report.

Permissionless is key

In another tweet, Buterin raised an interesting point. ""Realistically, many of the most valuable parts of defi are likely to be the most boring: just giving anyone in the world access to a crypto-dollar with an interest rate that matches inflation is already a huge boon to so many people.""

Realistically, many of the most valuable parts of defi are likely to be the most boring: just giving anyone in the world access to a crypto-dollar with an interest rate that matches inflation is already a huge boon to so many people. And we have that; we just need to improve it. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 1, 2020

While DeFi stands for decentralized finance, the fact it's permissionless is equally as important, perhaps more so in its current state. It means, essentially, that anyone can use these services, with the only barrier to entry being a little bit of technical knowledge.

Say you're living in a country whose sovereign fiat currency has a fast-increasing rate of inflation. Instead of saving in that currency and effectively seeing your capital dwindle, you could turn your money into a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and get a decent return rate on top of that. Of course, if U.S. dollars aren't your currency of choice, you can use DeFi to invest into other fiat currencies, and stablecoins that track the value of gold and other assets, etc.

Big potential and big risk

DeFi gives everyone in the world access to an essentially unlimited number of financial products and services. These opportunities, which range from simple savings products to complex trading platforms, are nearly frictionless, in the sense that they require very little infrastructure. The world's 1.7 billion unbanked adults can, theoretically, access all these opportunities without asking anyone for permission.

Also, by largely removing the middlemen (banks and related institutions), DeFi has the potential to make certain products cheaper, which could make a big difference in the long run.

""Defi is interesting as a use case for rapidly experimenting with new financial products with considerably less friction. It’s a huge step forward for democratizing access to financial products and the design of new ones, Ethan Buchman, CEO of Informal Systems and vice president of The Interchain Foundation, told Mashable in an e-mailed statement.

According to Buchman, there's still a while to go before these services are useful to an average person. In fact, it's currently mostly based on speculation and arbitrage, and a lot of it comes with considerable risk.

""While in principle the mechanisms are much more transparent than any traditional financial product, the general volatility of cryptocurrencies, the immaturity of DeFi smart contracts (ie. the potential for bugs), and the possibility of miner interference (ie. “Miner Extractable Value”) collectively make DeFi a dangerous place to play,"" he said.

The Justice Department (DOJ) charged a Houston man Tuesday in a plan to obtain two fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and invest funds from one of them in a cryptocurrency account.

The loans, worth a total of $1.1 million, were filed on behalf of businesses called Texas Barbecue and Houston Landscaping. Joshua Thomas Argires, 29, claimed both companies had numerous employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses, but neither has employees nor pays wages consistent with the amounts claimed in the PPP applications, according to the DOJ's complaint.

Argires, 29, is charged with making false statements to a financial institution, wire fraud, bank fraud and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.

Dive Insight:

The Texas case is hardly the first PPP-related fraud concern the Justice Department has raised. Two New England businessmen were charged in May with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to make false statements to the Small Business Administration (SBA) after they sought more than $543,000 in PPP loans.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in June said the number of loans approved through PPP, the speed with which they were processed, and the program's limited safeguards leave it open to ""significant risk that some fraudulent or inflated applications were approved.""

Both of Argires's loans were funded, but none of the funds were used for payroll or other expenses authorized under the PPP, the Justice Department said. The funds received on behalf of Texas Barbecue were invested in a cryptocurrency account. Per the PPP loan-level data provided by the SBA, Texas Barbecue's loan was processed by PrimeWay Federal Credit Union. Houston Landscaping's funds were held in a bank account and ""slowly depleted via ATM withdrawals,"" according to the charges, and this loan was processed by Bank of America.

Duplicate loans have been a concern throughout the program. The SBA's loan processing system failed to see when some borrowers submitted multiple applications with different lenders, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last month. Information from the wire service’s sources — and some Reddit posts — suggest at least 1,020 duplicate deposits were issued, potentially accounting for $116 million.

Although the SBA disclosed a list last week of recipients of PPP loans less than $150,000, analysts have found numerous flaws in the data. Particularly, more than 878,000 of the 4.9 million applications processed listed the number of jobs retained by borrowers as zero, or the field was left blank entirely, according to Bloomberg data.

Even after receiving coronavirus relief through PPP, about 22% of borrowers have fired or expect to lay off at least one worker, according to a survey published last week by the National Federation of Independent Business.",2020-07-17 11:35:00

In most industries, sales vectors are declining, as bankruptcies and layoffs rule the day. But companies in the crypto and blockchain space have been expanding, hiring and applying for new licenses.

The pandemic has caused suffering in this industry, as in others, but the fundamentals of crypto are better than those of traditional financial markets. We will experience some reshuffling, but the crypto and blockchain industry will become stronger through this crisis. Newmarket participants are looking for derivative and margin products, and they’re increasingly looking to trade on their phones and mobile applications.

A second wave

The next wave of COVID-19 would eviscerate new, underdeveloped companies. That’s why sustainability is very important. Soon, there will be a crash test not just for crypto players but for everyone. Those efficient companies will persist, however, and the industry may become stronger for it.

Traditional investors fear whether a second wave will again plunge the traditional market into turmoil. In March, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell to approximately $3,000 and promptly rebounded to over $9,000, even briefly hitting $10,000. By regaining its pre-pandemic level, we see how Bitcoin bounced back a lot faster than other financial investments. I anticipate crypto prices to collapse and quickly rebound in the event of a second wave of COVID-19.

Crypto will continue to grow strong despite a global economic recession though many still suffer from COVID-19 and the effects of lockdown. In a global economic recession, individuals and institutions have been turning away from traditional assets and have been seeking opportunities in cryptocurrency.

Traditional and institutional to become more aggressive in crypto

Therefore, traditional investors will continue to turn toward crypto assets, especially family offices and asset management companies. The market will only mature, particularly initial exchange offerings, decentralized finance and traditional financial markets. We see traditional investors becoming more aggressive when investing in this space, as well as building incubators for blockchain projects.

Multinational companies and even banks have set up new investment arms for blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, looking to diversify into these alternative assets. According to a recent Fidelity survey, 80% of institutional investors found digital assets appealing, while 60% of them have been proactively looking at Bitcoin as part of their usual portfolio investment.

In the survey, 74% of United States institutional investors and 82% of European investors saw cryptocurrency as appealing. Meanwhile, 36% of institutional respondents were attracted to cryptocurrency because it is “uncorrelated to other asset classes,” and 34% were attracted by the innovative nature of the technology. And 33% liked the high upside potential.

Commenting on the survey, Tom Jessop, the president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said: “These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class.” He also added:

“This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.”

Work from home is an opportunity for crypto

The shift of offline business and physical activities to an online setting to crypto and blockchain startups. From here on out, we will see discussions and debates over cryptocurrency investment from billionaires and traditional investors. Whether they support it or not, they will keep a closer eye on crypto and blockchain technology.

In the “new normal,” blockchain technology can be applied to the Internet of Things, medical systems, supply chains, and can be used for transparency in financial markets, charity and nongovernmental organizations. In Asian countries, for instance, little is known about how NGOs spend their money, and how many middlemen take a cut.

Sometimes, only 10% of a donation reaches those who truly need it. If this process is put on a blockchain, then everything is on-chain and transparent. There is no black box, and we can track donations to ensure that they are going where they were initially intended to go. After companies adopt blockchain technology for these purposes, only then will they begin to discuss tokenization.

For now, to be certain, most of the attention remains on Bitcoin. In a post-COVID-19 world, diversifying portfolios will become increasingly important, especially for asset management companies and banks. COVID-19, therefore, is an opportunity for crypto to penetrate new markets, to work with big banks and to attract mainstream investors.

Volume up.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-supply-doubles-to-12-billion-following-a-50-cryptocurrency-market-price-drop/,"Stablecoin Supply Doubles to 12 Billion Following a 50% Cryptocurrency Market Price Drop

The total supply of stablecoins in existence has doubled to 12 billion, following an increased demand sparked off by the March 12 (Black Thursday) 50% crypto price crash.

The findings from the latest research study by Coin Metrics, which is sponsored by Bitstamp, show that it took a period between March 12 and the first half of July to add 6 billion stablecoins.

Before this addition, it had taken five years for global supply to reach the initial 6 billion.

The report comments that the March 12th event was spurred by a massive sell-off in the global equity markets as fear over Covid-19 suddenly set in.

Uncertain about the future, global investors rushed to move out equity and crypto markets, sparking a global shortage of dollars.

For crypto-asset holders that could not cash out, stablecoins proved a sanctuary hence the spiked demand, the report explains.

“Moving into stablecoins allows investors to effectively keep money parked on the sideline without having to completely cash out into fiat currency and incurring fees. This rush to safety likely accounted for a significant portion of the increased stablecoin demand following March 12th.”

The data from the study seemingly agrees with Coin Metrics’ conclusions.

The data appears to show that within two weeks of the crash, “over 800 million new USDT_ETH were issued.” This contrasts with “about 740 million USDT_ETH (that) were issued from January 1st through March 11th.”

Supply of another stablecoin, USDT_TRX would increase by “over 2B by the end of June.”

Other stablecoins rose as well, but by no more than a few hundred million. Tether, once again, led the way by a large margin.

Furthermore, the findings also show that addresses with at least $1M worth of USDT_ETH hold about 4.35B units of the total supply.

On the other hand, addresses holding $1,000 or less are a tiny portion of the overall supply.

Data also shows that the amount of USDT_ETH held by these large addresses increased by a significant amount in late-March and April, which suggests exchanges were suddenly holding larger amounts of stablecoins.

Coin Metrics suggests that exchanges make up a large portion of the addresses​ holding $1M worth of USDT_ETH or greater.

The report adds that “this may also be due to exchanges themselves converting fiat into stablecoins like USDT_ETH.”

Stablecoins make it relatively easy to transfer money between exchanges and offer settlement functionality without needing to rely on traditional wire transfers.

In the meantime, the findings also seem to reaffirm Tether’s status as the “most extensively in crypto-asset trading.” This likely contributes to its fluctuating price.

Stablecoins are used as a quote currency in crypto-asset trading pairs far more than fiat currencies on most exchanges.

A large majority of the stablecoin trading volume and supply is dominated by tether (USDT).

Do you think the supply of stablecoins will continue to grow at the same pace going forward? Tell us your thoughts in the comments section below?

Subhash Chandra Garg, former Finance and Economic Affairs Secretary of India, has told the Indian crypto community that crypto assets should be regulated as commodities. However, he stands by his draft crypto bill that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be outlawed.

Garg Proposes Indian Government Regulates Crypto as Commodity

Subhash Chandra Garg, former Economic Affairs Secretary and Finance Secretary of India, talked about the prospect of regulating cryptocurrency in the country during a webinar entitled “Cryptocurrency in India: What the future holds.” It was organized by law firm Khaitan & Co. in association with Blockon and Crebaco Global. Garg was the keynote speaker and he also appeared on the webinar’s panel discussion.

Garg explained via Twitter on Saturday that he made a case in this webinar for the “evolution of Demat paper currency as digital currency of future, outlawing of pretender cryptocurrencies to protect people and to allow regulated development and trading of crypto assets as commodities.”

During his keynote speech, after giving the examples of gold, silver, and diamonds, Garg said the value of crypto assets “lies in the eye of the beholder.” He added: “If someone wants to value code which is in the form of a crypto asset and wants to invest in it, it can do in that form, in that way. Crypto asset is a commodity, not a cryptocurrency.”

Garg also warned about crypto scams and Ponzi schemes, noting that it is the “duty of the government to … protect the gullible people, people who don’t know … I would suggest that the government regulates this very well.” He concluded:

Private cryptocurrencies have no justification to exist … I stand by the recommendation in that cryptocurrencies should be outlawed, should not be allowed to be operated … Crypto assets as commodities should be allowed.

Following Garg’s keynote speech was a panel discussion, during which panelists tried to convince the former finance secretary that cryptocurrency should not be banned. Nischal Shetty, the CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, was one of the panelists. He explained to Garg that cryptocurrency is not trying to compete with the INR. In response to regulating it as a commodity, he said there is no differentiator in the draft bill, suggesting that there could be a misunderstanding in the bill. You can watch the entire webinar and panel discussion here.

While serving as the Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, Garg headed the inter-ministerial committee which drafted the infamous bill to ban bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He has since resigned from government. His “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” was submitted to the government early last year.

Since the supreme court quashed the circular by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian crypto industry has been growing rapidly. Local trading platforms are seeing colossal increases in trading volumes and signups. Last week, a major Indian corporation, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), launched cryptocurrency trading solutions for banks.

What do you think about Garg’s view on crypto in India? Let us know in the comments section below.

He specifically highlights the upside of four little-known crypto assets that he believes could see big growth in the short term.

“I believe that DeFi outside of Ethereum is likely to be a big growth area in the coming months even if we still have great DeFi projects launching on Ethereum.”

Davis calls out Kava (KAVA), Band Protocol (BAND), Switcheo (SWTH) and Nash (NEX) as his top picks.

Kava is a cross-chain, DeFi lending platform. Its token is trading at about $1.97 at the time of writing, and it has seen 4x gains since mid-May.

Despite its already-skyrocketing value, Davis says the token still has “massive potential for long-term price appreciation.”

“The team and the backers of Kava are very, very strong as well. In my opinion, this has all the makings to be as big as Ethereum’s MakerDao, which at its height had a market cap over $1 billion.”

Band Protocol is a Cosmos blockchain native and cross-chain data oracle network that competes with Chainlink. Its token is currently trading at about $2.42 at time of writing and has increased about 120% in price since the beginning of July. Says Davis,

“BAND already has a big, growing list of high-profile partners, people like Binance and Wanchain and Elrond and Fantom and Kava, of course.”

SWTH and NEX are both decentralized exchange tokens. Davis says they have upside potential because Switcheo is launching a new derivatives exchange and upgrading their token model, and Nash just launched a zero-fee fiat on-ramp for users in the European Union.

Davis does warn, however, that both are competing with tons of other decentralized exchanges, which could impact their growth.

Several blockchain and crypto firms such as TAGZ, an Australian digital currency exchange, and investment company Adaptive Capital have been forced to close down operations in recent months.

However, the TokenInsight team notes that decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as an exciting and seemingly promising aspect of the cryptocurrency sector and ecosystem. The DeFi space, which includes relatively new protocols such as Compound, Uniswap, and MakerDAO, have seen significant growth and adoption, despite the Coronavirus crisis. This may largely be attributed to the fact that DeFi protocols operate in an all-digital environment.

According to TokenInsight’s DeFi Industry Research Report for Q2 2020, the most “depressing moment” during the first half of this year was when the global financial market turmoil also affected the fragile cryptocurrency industry, an event, and date that’s now referred to as the “Black Thursday” which took place on March 12, 13 2020.

The report from TokenInsight confirms that on Black Thursday, the blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) industry experienced a “market-wide panic and dried up market liquidity which resulted [in even more] marketwide liquidation and opened the door for … structural risks,” especially in the volatile DeFi ecosystem.

The report pointed out that many people in the crypto space were wishfully thinking the industry would “shine” during a global economic crisis, however, the Black Thursday market crash proved to industry participants that the cryptocurrency financial market is significantly correlated with the traditional markets.

According to TokenInsight, the historic crash on March 12, 2020, showed us that there was a “cascading effect,” as every single aspect of the cryptocurrency market was affected by the financial market collapse due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic.

Despite these setbacks, the total value locked in USD (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem recovered and surged by $1 billion, an increase of 147% during H1 2020. “Its growth rate is expected to remain steady upwards,” according to TokenInsight’s research.

They explain:

“One of the most important metrics [when] looking at the growth of DeFi is Total Value Locked in USD (TVL). The TVL has experienced dramatic increases from mid-June when it was hovering around $1 billion and jumped to more than $1.6 billion in just a matter of 2 weeks.”

They continued:

“The DeFi ecosystem experienced a [sharp] downturn in mid-February from $1.2 billion in TVL to its recent lowest point of $500 million during the Black Thursday. post market crash, [but then later] the TVL has [continued to increase] and shot up [considerably] due [mainly] to Compound governance token’s incentivized liquidity mining initiatives.”

The report further noted that the “explosive” growth of the DeFi ecosystem due to the popularity of the incentivized liquidity mining (yield farming) in June 2020, along with consistently high lending rates helped attract more traders and investors. The TVL increased from $950 million in January 2020 to over $1.68 billion in June 2020, and presently stands at over $2.5 billion according to DeFi Pulse data.

The number of DeFi users has reportedly increased from around 100,000 in early 2020 to currently over 230,000, the report from TokenInsight reveals.

The report confirmed:

“Overall, the holding period return for most of the DeFi tokens have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in H1 2020.”

Kyber Network (KNC) delivered over 4x return against BTC since the beginning of 2020, the report revealed. Meanwhile, ThorChain (RUNE) generated over 2x versus BTC and Bancor Network (BNT) delivered more than 2x during the first half of this year.

Notably, other smaller crypto projects like 0x (ZRX), Loopring (LRC), and Airswap (ASP) have all managed to outperform BTC and ETH, at least for now, during these uncertain and unpredictable times.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes for great reasons, sometimes for awful ones, and sometimes because a level of noise and action coalesces into an awareness that something big has shifted.

Wednesday was one of those days, with the staccato of compromised Twitter accounts (including ours) escalating to reach prominent public figures including current and former heads of state. The scale of the hack was spectacular.

The mainstream press called this a “bitcoin scam,” and to some extent it was – the hacker set up the typical ploy of promising to send back double whatever amount of bitcoin anyone sent to a certain wallet. It’s amazing that people fall for this.

But some people do – a total of $123,000 worth of BTC was sent in approximately 400 transactions in total (some may have been the hacker recycling coins to inflate the activity). There were 17 transactions sent, or more than $1,000. Glossing over the fact that this is an astonishingly small amount for the scale of the hack, some skeptics took the opportunity to remind everyone how bitcoin was a scammer’s paradise.

Close the door

Some commentators went as far as to call for the banning of bitcoin. “If bitcoin were illegal,” goes the reasoning, “this wouldn’t happen.” Of course, this brought out the defenders by the droves, who pointed out – among other compelling arguments – that making something illegal doesn’t stop it from happening; it often just makes it harder to monitor. And banning bitcoin would not stop its use nor eliminate its value.

But it did highlight a pervasive concern among many mainstream investors: a lack of regulatory clarity. Could the U.S. decide to outlaw bitcoin transactions within its jurisdiction? The very possibility is understandably enough to keep cautious investors away.

Technically, the U.S. could not ban bitcoin on a global scale – bitcoin lives on a distributed network that would continue to exist even if U.S.-based nodes shut off and U.S.-based users dropped out. One of the strengths of bitcoin is that it is out of the range of state actors.

But, realistically, making the holding or transacting of bitcoin illegal for U.S.-based entities and individuals would be a big shock to the price as its store of value narrative would take a significant hit.

What’s more, the U.S. has considerable influence over the FATF, which sets anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing systems for the world’s banks and payments companies. The organization could be pressured to penalize governments that allow cryptocurrency services within their jurisdiction. Yet all of these concerns seem unfounded. Last week, the FATF announced its intention to step up crypto asset supervision with a view to building a global framework, which implies an interest in monitoring rather than stopping.

And in the wake of the Twitter hack, the talk coming out of Washington is not about bitcoin. The concern is the centralization of platforms. Twitter is under scrutiny much more than bitcoin.

If regulators were going to jump on the “ban bitcoin” bandwagon given the media frenzy, now would be the time. That they have not done so is a strong sign of acceptance. True, there may yet be hiccups ahead in the road to systemic support – but so far, the concern is more about the vulnerabilities in centralized services.

Furthermore, the amount of bitcoin involved in the scam is minuscule compared to what the take could have been, given the scale of the operation. Maybe the public is becoming more scam-savvy? And we should all be grateful that the hackers only wanted bitcoin, when you consider that they had control of the Twitter accounts of the likes of Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu, Barack Obama, Apple…

The lack of focus on bitcoin in Washington this week is a step forward, especially in the eyes of professional investors eager for greater regulatory clarity. If indeed bitcoin does weather this without louder calls for a clampdown, that is a strong sign that regulators acknowledge that bitcoin is here to stay.

I see you

Another way in which the Twitter hack was positive for bitcoin is the spotlight shone on the forensic transparency of the network.

Within hours of the hack, blockchain analysts were already constructing profiles of the hacker’s history and tracking the movements of the ill-gotten funds.

The wallets in question may not have a name and address associated with them, but they are indelibly there for anyone to monitor, and transactions into and out of these wallets cannot be hidden nor undone. Digital fiat money transfers may have associated names and addresses, but movements are easier to obscure. And names and addresses can be faked.

What’s more, the fact that anyone can access this data spreads the potential for useful information coming to light. While there may initially be different interpretations of the addresses and transfers, a consensus interpretation tends to emerge, which is likely to be a help to law enforcement. And forensic techniques are advancing, as is the diversity of approaches to blockchain data analysis. This should reassure regulators that bitcoin-related crime is not the threat to society some skeptics claim.

The bigger question

It is true that having bitcoin in mainstream headlines is good for its “brand recognition” – but, in this case, the association with scams is not in its favor. Yet while politicians do pay attention to what the media is saying, by next week the “bitcoin scam” headlines will have faded into the pixels of time, given the frenetic news cycle we live in.

And the market itself does not seem worried – the bitcoin price barely budged in the aftermath of the news.

The lasting effect will be a deeper understanding for those willing to ask the right questions, not just about bitcoin’s seizure resistance but also about how one weak access point left so much power in a bad actor’s hands.

That is a third beneficial outcome that should strengthen interest in blockchain applications beyond crypto assets. Growing concern over centralized vulnerabilities in communication platforms is just the beginning. From there to worrying about vulnerabilities in the centralized financial systems on which our society runs is not that big a step.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

This week exemplified the seesaw of good news swiftly followed by dampeners. Better-than-expected earnings were offset by forecast downgrades, which seem to be spooking investors. Vaccine optimism, buoyed by positive results from a few laboratories, yet again got tempered by vaccine realism, as even really good candidates could take years before they become widely available. And when it comes to the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases, positive news in some areas was offset by devastating news in others.

The S&P 500 is very close to having clawed back its losses for the year-to-date, and by the time you read this, might well have done so. It is 7% higher than this time last year. I’ve given up wondering what economic outlook it is discounting.

Bitcoin has had a lackluster performance so far this month, yet it continues to outperform other major indices and assets on a year-to-date basis. Its lack of volatility has traders champing at the bit, however, and the emotional tension of waiting for a breakout, any breakout, could soon start to impact trading patterns.

CHAIN LINKS

Crypto asset fund manager Grayscale Investments* released its Q2 report, which revealed new investment of over $900 million over the quarter, its largest quarterly inflow to date, and 80% more than the previous quarterly high in Q1. TAKEAWAY: While the BTC price has been stagnant of late, it appreciated over 40% in Q2, largely as part of a broader market recovery from post-crash lows, but also perhaps partially because of growing institutional support. We don’t know, however, how much of the inflow is new investment and how much is recycled as qualified investors sell their holding in the market at a premium and buy back in at par. (*Grayscale is owned by DCG, also the parent of CoinDesk.)

Lex Sokolin, the CMO and Global Fintech Co-Head at Ethereum laboratory ConsenSys, published an analysis of the rumored upcoming listing of crypto exchange Coinbase. TAKEAWAY: The lack of available data at the current time is one major obstacle for analysts trying to get a feel for what a listing valuation could be, but Lex does an admirable job of scraping information from public sources. Yet even if/when listing documents are filed and more numbers become available, analysts will still have a hard time figuring this one out: what exactly is Coinbase? Is it an exchange? A bank? A custodian?

Crypto data provider Coin Metrics has published a report on stablecoins that looks into their explosive growth: It took supply five years to reach $6 billion in March 2012, and only four months since then to double that. TAKEAWAY: The report takes a close look at pegs – not everyone realizes that dollar stablecoins are not always worth $1, and that the difference can exert a material influence on supply as issuers arbitrage profit opportunities.

Crypto fund manager Arca reviewed its 2020 predictions from January, and updated them for the rest of the year. TAKEAWAY: The ones I found particularly interesting included the growth in non-crypto companies issuing crypto tokens, the rise of non-fungible tokens as an asset group and the growing influence of younger generations (I wrote more about this here).

Bitcoin miners sent less bitcoin to exchanges during the second quarter of 2020 than at any time over the past 12 months. TAKEAWAY: This can be taken as bullish (miners are choosing to hold onto their mined bitcoin because they believe the price will go up) or bearish (they would rather not sell into what they think will be a weak market). Either way, we should remember that newly mined bitcoins now account for a very small fraction of trading volume, so the influence of miners’ decisions is mitigated. Their actions are worth watching, however, as most have close relationships with OTC desks that move high volumes and have their ear to the ground.

The number of addresses holding a large number of bitcoins, known as “whale addresses,” has declined to a 14-month low. TAKEAWAY: As with the miner flows metric above, this can also be either bearish or bullish. It’s not positive news for the asset price outlook to see large holders reduce their stakes; but a broader distribution of ownership is better for price resilience.

U.S.-based digital asset firm BitOoda published a report, together with the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, that shows 50% of bitcoin mining is in China, and 14% in the U.S. TAKEAWAY: Earlier estimates had put China’s market share at 65%, so if these figures are accurate, the bitcoin mining industry is becoming more decentralized and less dependent on China.

Crypto financial app Abra has settled charges from the SEC and the CFTC relating to its offering of synthetic swaps to retail investors without registering or selling them on a recognized national exchange. Abra and its Philippines-based partner company Plutus will pay $300,000 in fines and do not have to acknowledge the accusations. TAKEAWAY: This is the long arm of the law in action. Abra limited its offering to non-U.S. investors, and moved most of its operations overseas. But the regulators determined that having an office in San Francisco from which the contracts were marketed and hedged, serving a handful of U.S. retail investors that got through the geofencing, and having marketed to retail investors in the early days of the contract, put Abra in violation of securities laws. In other words, it doesn’t matter where your main base is – if your activity touches U.S. citizens and/or U.S. soil, you fall under U.S. jurisdiction.

On a recent panel, Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), said the recent changes to the BitLicense law were being well received. TAKEAWAY: The original BitLicense, which emerged just over five years ago as a requirement for any crypto business wanting to operate in the state of New York, received significant criticism for its onerous application obligations and the high cost of compliance. Lacewell introduced some reforms to the regulation that aimed to lower the barriers and encourage more experimentation. It’s not surprising they are being well received, but it is good news to get the confirmation. Many crypto businesses chose to not do business in New York as a result of the original design, and the update does not mean they will come back. But Wall Street is one of the greatest financial centers in the world, and if crypto is going to run with the “big boys,” a presence at the heart of finance will be a step forward in the push to position crypto assets as a respectable investment for institutional portfolios.

Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin has revealed his work on a new smart-contract language for Bitcoin called Sapio, which he hopes will increase the “financial self-sovereignty” of users. TAKEAWAY: It’s worth keeping an eye on technological developments even in assets that, for many, are based on the store-of-value narrative. Enhanced smart contract ability will not only potentially lend application functionalities to Bitcoin, giving it a “residual value” and further likening it to gold (which, as well as an investment asset, is used in jewelry, technology, dentistry, etc.); it could also make it easier and/or safer to custody and exchange.

BitGo will offer API support for the latest “Travel Rule” guidelines from the FATF that stipulate originators and beneficiaries of financial transactions over $1,000 be identified. TAKEAWAY: This was always going to be a difficult proposition with crypto assets, since identification of both ends of a transaction is often not possible, and goes against the integral idea that transfers can be decentralized and independent of a third party. The FATF’s reach is long, however, and non-compliance is likely to be costly for jurisdictions that cannot control crypto activity within their boundaries. Technological aids like BitGo’s API, provided by a firm with a long history of custodial services, are likely to calm fears of both regulators and clients. Plus, BitGo’s origin is as a custody technology provider – in 2013, it launched the first multi-sig wallet, a staple of custody technology today.

Also, Shyft Network this week announced that it is releasing its blockchain-based solution to help crypto companies comply with the FATF requirements. TAKEAWAY: Tools like this are trying to get ahead of what is going to be a significant problem: the security vulnerabilities inherent in the FATF’s requirement to send sensitive financial information back and forth.

The crypto options market is growing fast, both in volumes and in number of platforms. Gate.io, a relatively small offshore exchange, has launched a new options trading feature, and Singapore-based exchange Huobi, which already offers futures and perpetual swaps, plans to do so later this year. TAKEAWAY: Growth in options is a sign of a maturing market, and a necessary step for greater institutional involvement. How long this growth will continue is an open question, especially given the declining volumes in crypto spot and futures markets.

Switzerland-based crypto custodian Metaco has closed a Series A round that was reportedly oversubscribed by a factor of two. Investors include Standard Chartered, smart-card and currency note printer Giesecke+Devrient, Zürcher Kantonalbank (the fourth-largest bank in Switzerland) and the country’s postal service Swiss Post. TAKEAWAY: That this was reportedly oversubscribed is a sign of growing interest in Europe in digital asset market infrastructure. Also, the mix and profile of the investors is intriguing.

It’s a plum assignment for New York-based Paxos, which last week launched Paxos Crypto Brokerage and announced its first customer in Revolut US, the American division of the U.K.-based fintech firm that offers bitcoin trading. A formal announcement of the PayPal relationship could come as soon as this week, one source said.

The offering would make PayPal one of the most prominent mainstream companies to offer cryptocurrency purchases, joining fellow publicly traded payments provider Square and unicorn stock brokerage Robinhood.

It is not clear exactly which cryptocurrencies PayPal intends to offer. Paxos declined to comment for this story. PayPal did not return requests for comment by press time. CoinDesk broke the news of PayPal’s crypto plans on June 22.

CoinDesk reported then that PayPal and its Venmo subsidiary would be bringing direct buying and selling of crypto to some portion of the company’s 325 million users.

The new Paxos brokerage, an API-based solution for making crypto services easy for businesses to roll out, allows cryptocurrency buying, selling, holding and sending capabilities while handling all regulatory compliance aspects. Paxos, which holds a New York state trust charter, is a qualified custodian, legally permitted to hold gold and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) on institutional investors’ behalf.

San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has a longstanding relationship with PayPal, was said to be in line to provide some kind of white-labeled crypto offering. European exchange Bitstamp (which provides crypto liquidity to Revolut in the U.K.) was also mentioned as a contender at the time. Both companies declined to comment for this story.

PayPal playing catch-up

The crypto wings of traditional fintech apps are steadily growing in stature.

Crypto is steadily moving from being a pseudo-asset with fringe appeal to becoming a must-have for fintech and challenger-bank apps looking to build revenue and customers.

In addition to Revolut entering the U.S. market with crypto trading, Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has seen its bitcoin trading revenues grow. Square rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018 and reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.

(Robinhood had over 2 million downloads in the quarter it released Robinhood Crypto, the firm’s highest count ever.)",2020-07-20 03:52:51+00:00,https://icoexaminer.com/ico-news/tech-giants-face-hefty-lawsuit-for-anti-crypto-stance/,"A number of large tech giants including Facebook, Google, and Twitter are being pursued in Australian courts for their bans on cryptocurrency advertising in 2018, with the case reportedly being “…put before a senior barrister for review, pending funding to file.”

With litigant’s claims already exceeding USD$600 million, the amount in claimed damages are speculated to grow into a multi-billion affair as more people join the no win/no fee class action taking place in Australian courts.

Misuse of Market Power

The claims for damages stem from the advertising ban on cryptocurrency-related products, services and investments on the social media platforms which began in January 2018, towards the tail-end of a cryptocurrency bubble, and a period in which a large number of crypto and ICO-related projects had been revealed to be either fraudulent or business incompetent in the absence of any real regulatory oversight.

However, according to the legal firm organising the action, JPB Liberty, the ban was indiscriminate and thus in breach of the Australian Competition and Consumer Law and, as such, they are seeking “…damages for worldwide losses of Crypto Industry members and investors.”

JPB Liberty state that the advertising ban “…dropped Crypto markets by hundreds of billions of dollars. Crypto exchange volumes also dropped by 60-90%.”

With the new Web 3.0 relying on blockchain technology and digital assets, the lawyers suggest that the technology platforms acted as a cartel in a “…concerted practice that has the purpose and/or likely effect of substantially lessening competition…[which is a]…misuse of market power.”

It is not known at this stage when a verdict will be rendered.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-days-destroyed-metric-explained,"The concept of bitcoin days destroyed (BDD) was introduced in 2011, two years after the creation of the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin. People were already beginning to create blockchain metrics to measure on-chain transaction activity and value.

This episode is sponsored by Bitstamp and Crypto.com.

Once the first cryptocurrency metric was created, BDD was quickly followed by a plethora of other unique metrics including unspent transaction output (UTXO), market value to realized value (MVRV) and spent output profit ratio (SOPR). Despite the sophistication of cryptocurrency data and analysis since 2011, BDD remains a fundamental metric to understanding and valuing bitcoin.

“[BDD] is a metric that reflects the collective action of long-term [BTC] holders,” said CoinDesk senior research analyst Galen Moore on a special podcast episode about the metric. “What’s the psychology of the long-term holder? You can see that in a collective way [through BDD] in a way I don’t think is possible in other asset categories.”

Moore interviewed Coin Metrics’ Lucas Nuzzi on July 7 to learn more about BDD’s use cases and limitations. In a follow-up discussion July 9, Moore noted no other financial asset enables traders and investors to see the activity of long-term asset holders as transparently as bitcoin.

To this, CoinDesk research intern Duy Nguyen noted the motivations behind why long-term holders are moving funds at any given time is still largely a guessing game that requires further off-chain analysis beyond the scope of BDD.",2020-07-19 14:00:00+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/07/19/dogecoin-surges-after-elon-musk-pimps-canine-crypto-addresses-bitcoin-btc-giveaway-scam/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again on a tear – up nearly 10% in its US dollar and Bitcoin pairs at time of writing – after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk pimps the canine crypto.

In a viral tweet, Musk posted a meme suggesting that the cryptocurrency, which was introduced as a joke cryptocurrency in 2013, could take over and become the global reserve currency.

Following the tweet, Dogecoin climbed as high as $0.003835 on Saturday – nearly a 20% surge according to CoinMarketCap.

When asked by one of his followers where his Bitcoin is from the Twitter giveaway scam, the Tesla CEO replies,

“Excuse me, I only sell Doge.”

Musk’s social media stunt comes days after one of the most notorious Twitter hacks in history. On Wednesday, the crypto scammers briefly took over the accounts of popular personalities including former president Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The compromised accounts posted malicious tweets that encouraged followers to send $1,000 in BTC, with the promise of doubling their contribution. The crypto looters ran off with more than 12 BTC worth over $110,000.

Dogecoin’s sudden spike is an example of the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. Prices may rise and fall with little to no warning.",2020-07-19 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/142-million-guests-hackers-attempt-to-sell-mgm-grand-data-dump-for-cryptocurrency/,"142 Million Guests: Hackers Attempt to Sell MGM Grand Data Dump for Cryptocurrency

Last year the giant resort firm MGM Grand was hacked and the cybercriminals ostensibly obtained a massive dump of names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. Now according to vendors on the deep web, hackers have been trying to sell the data dump for monero or bitcoin. The hackers claim the dump has over 142 million MGM Grand guests’ information.

A recent report details that hackers have been trying to unload a large data dump with information on an alleged 142 million MGM Grand hotel guests.

The hackers have been attempting to sell the data on darknet markets for roughly $2,939 worth of bitcoin (BTC) or monero (XMR). The report initially stemmed from Zdnet and it was assumed last year that the hackers only obtained information concerning 10 million guests in 2019.

The sellers now claim there is data for approximately 142,479,937 MGM Grand hotel guests. However, the security group who monitored MGM Grand’s data say the hackers may be lying about how much information they actually stole.

Night Lion Security founder, Vinny Troia, told the columnist Catalin Cimpanu via email correspondence that the company did not own or manage MGM’s full database. A spokesperson from MGM Grand responded to an email from Cimpanu as well and stated:

MGM Resorts was aware of the scope of this previously reported incident from last summer and has already addressed the situation. The vast majority of data consisted of contact information like names, postal addresses, and email addresses.

When the data leak was revealed to the public, it was also discovered that the list of guests included a number of high-profile people and celebrities like the pop singer Justin Bieber and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.

The hackers did publish a free sample, so the public could see that the attacker’s claims were seemingly legitimate. MGM Grand maintains that hotel stay details, Social Security numbers, and other types of financial data were not taken.

This isn’t the first time the MGM Grand data has made waves on the web. Zdnet discussed the situation with the Head of Research at the intel firm KELA, Irina Nesterovsky, about the subject when the media discovered the leak in February 2019.

Nesterovsky claimed at the time that the data dump was previously sold to “private hacking circles since at least July 2019.” Moreover, the posts that surfaced in Russia allegedly assert there was data on over 200 million MGM Guests.

Nesterovsky’s claims suggest that the data dump might be being separated into parts and then sold for cryptocurrency.

Whenever Cloudflare goes down or has some other type of technical difficulties, it immediately affects millions of websites that use its software. The recent downtime also resulted in a considerable decline in the number of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions that could be confirmed.

Jameson Lopp, the CTO at CasaHODL, a Bitcoin security firm, noted via Twitter (on July 17, 2020):

“The Cloudflare DNS [Domain Name System] outage can be seen reflected in the rate of Bitcoin transactions broadcast, presumably because popular web wallets became inaccessible.”

Lopp shared a chart that confirmed that there was a significant decline in the number of BTC transactions being processed every second.

Cloudflare’s management had noted on the provider’s official website (at around 10 p.m. UTC on July 17, 2020):

“This afternoon we saw an outage across some parts of our network, [however] it was not as a result of an attack. It appears a router on our global backbone announced bad routes and caused some portions of the network to not be available. We believe we have addressed the root cause and are monitoring systems for stability now.”

At around 10:57 p.m. UTC, a final update confirmed that the issue had been resolved.

While the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain network itself did not experience an outage when Cloudflare went down, many traders or investors may not have been able to conduct transactions because crypto wallets and exchanges use Cloudflare (which is a centralized solution).

Centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and just about all others have to regularly go offline to perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance work. One of the main value propositions of cryptocurrencies are that they’re decentralized, meaning there’s no central authority that can step in to shut down a platform or system.

However, these types of events indicate that cryptocurrencies are not truly decentralized because they still depend on centralized infrastructure (like Cloudflare). Nearly all the so-called blockchain or crypto projects also use Github to upload their project’s source code.

Github has a centralized management which has, on many occasions, restricted or denied access to users in certain parts of the world, like Iran. During an interview with Crowdfund Insider, Ray Youssef, the CEO at P2P Bitcoin marketplace Paxful, clarified that the platform was peer to peer but not decentralized. That’s because Paxful needs to follow strict KYC/AML guidelines, which are required by regulatory authorities across the globe.

It is highly unlikely that crypto’s main value proposition, which promises “decentralization,” will ever become a reality. Many so-called decentralized platforms like IOTA, bZX, and dForce (among many others) have been launched so that users can participate in permissionless markets or platforms, however, many of them were hacked and their creators had to step in to address the issue. This means they’re not truly decentralized.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-social-network-minds-users-twitter-facebook-privacy/,"Crypto Social Network 'Minds' Sees Users Flock From Twitter and Facebook Over Privacy Concerns

Crypto social media platform Minds has been garnering users who are concerned about their privacy, according to the company’s CEO. The open-source platform, seen as an alternative to Facebook or Twitter, awards users with cryptocurrency for engagement.

Crypto Social Network Minds Gaining Popularity

Privacy-oriented social media platform “Minds,” often touted as an antithesis to Facebook and Twitter, has been seeing considerable growth in the number of users, according to its founder and CEO, Bill Ottman. The American entrepreneur told IANS publication that his platform “has already attracted people all over the world who are concerned about privacy practices on social networks.”

Users were already migrating from mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, due to privacy concerns even before the great Twitter hack that saw high-profile accounts tweet about bitcoin giveaways. Among compromised accounts were those of U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, former U.S. President Barack Obama, Google, Apple, Warren Buffett, and many well-known people in the crypto space.

Self-described as a free “crypto social network” that upholds internet freedom, Minds now has over 2.5 million registered users in 240 countries, with around 300,000 monthly active users and approximately 2 million active visitors, Ottman told IANS, adding that last month:

Over 250,000 new users joined the platform from Thailand due to privacy policy concerns on Twitter.

In addition, more than 150,000 Vietnamese users joined the platform last year over privacy concerns on Twitter and Facebook, the news outlet continued, noting that “The growth is typically a direct result of scandals with mainstream media platforms.”

Minimizing Privacy Concerns

Emphasizing that Minds’ core proposition is privacy, Ottman says he aims to provide a “spying free” alternative to mainstream social media platforms, like Facebook or Twitter, Gadgets360, an NDTV venture, quoted him as saying on Thursday. Ottman pointed out that mainstream social media apps opt users into surveillance by default with little transparency into how their data can be used and sold. “Facebook and the others are closed platforms that are extracting value from the users,” he asserted, elaborating:

Everyday there’s a new scandal. People are looking for alternatives and want to diversify … The trend is towards open source. We’ve seen this happen in other areas already. We believe like Linux, Wikipedia, Bitcoin, this is going to happen in social media as well.

Minds faced its own controversies in 2018 when many hate groups began using the platform to spread their messages. The company subsequently took steps to remove the content; it is still working out the line between free speech and hate speech.

Getting Paid for User Engagement

While the platform has plans to add several new features this year, Ottman said that many users are simply attracted to getting paid for using the platform. “Especially now, with covid-19, people are really looking for independent revenue streams, and combining social media and monetisation will be something that all social networks focus on more,” the CEO opined.

Users are rewarded for their engagement in the platform’s native ERC20 token. “You can earn tokens for your contributions to the Minds network. The more interactions on your content, the greater your share of the daily token reward pool to your Offchain address,” according to Minds’ FAQs. Users can also receive direct payments in the Minds token and ether from other users. With bank deposits, BTC, and ETH as cash out options, Ottman emphasized:

You can earn dollars (or your rupees or whatever) or ethereum or bitcoin.

However, with a monetary incentive for high engagement, users may post more controversial subjects or use clickbait content. Ottman admitted that this is a problem, pointing to how Twitter “fact-checked” President Donald Trump’s tweets, which he called a “short-sighted” move by Twitter. To alleviate this problem, “We have started a program to create webs of trust through decentralised identity, based on users and content,” Ottman described, reiterating that his company “is researching the possibility of a decentralised reputation system.”

Minds is currently trying to attract users in India where the government has banned 59 Chinese apps at the end of June, including the popular video-sharing platform Tiktok.

Coinbase customers will be able to purchase, sell, convert, send, receive, or store ALGO. The digital asset exchange confirmed that ALGO is available in all Coinbase-supported regions.

Established by Silvio Micali, an experienced cryptographer and Turing award winner, Algorand aims to address some of the technical limitations of current blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) infrastructure.

As explained by Coinbase, the Algorand project aims to improve decentralization, scalability, and security. Launched in June of last year, Algorand offers a foundation for existing businesses and new initiatives to operate internationally in the nascent “decentralized” economy.

Algorand intends to offer a permissionless (public), “pure” proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol that can support the scale, “open” participation, and transaction finality needed to develop scalable blockchain or DLT projects.

In August 2019, ALGO was listed on Coinbase Pro, which now confirmed that it will support EUR and GBP trading with the ALGO token, beginning on July 21, 2020. ALGO is supported by Coinbase Custody for secure cold (offline) storage and staking as well.

The Coinbase team noted:

“One of the most common requests we hear from customers is to be able to buy and sell more cryptocurrencies on Coinbase. We announced a new process for listing assets, designed in part to accelerate the addition of more cryptocurrencies. We are also investing in new tools to help people understand and explore cryptocurrencies. We launched informational asset pages (see ALGO here), as well as a new section of the Coinbase website to answer common questions about crypto.”

On July 21, 2020, Coinbase Pro will be adding support for new order books for Algorand (ALGO), Chainlink (LINK), XRP, and Tezos (XTZ). As confirmed by Coinbase, the new trading pairs will be: ALGO-EUR, ALGO-GBP, LINK-EUR, LINK-GBP, XRP-GBP and XTZ-EUR, XTZ-GBP.",2020-07-16 00:00:00

Notably, this amount is more than twice the actual amount ($121,000) that hackers collected via victims.



Despite Coinbase's action, its 14 customers still fell prey to the scam and sent around $3,000 worth of bitcoin to hackers before the exchange blacklisted their addresses, said Martin.

Gemini, Kraken, and Binance users also tried sending bitcoins to the addresses, but not as much as Coinbase's customers, per the report. All these exchanges moved to block the addresses as soon as the scam came to light.

The wide-spread attack took place on Wednesday on Twitter, which saw 130 accounts under its control, including those owned by major figures like Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Elon Musk.

Following the bitcoin

According to blockchain analytics firms, some of the stolen bitcoin has moved to some exchanges and bitcoin mixers like Wasabi Wallet.

""We can see very small amounts going to known, regulated crypto exchanges,"" Elliptic's co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson told The Block. He declined to disclose the names of the exchanges for confidentiality reasons. Robinson further said that 2.89 bitcoin, or 22% of the total amount, was also sent to Wasabi Wallet for mixing purposes.

Another blockchain analytics firm Whitestream told The Block that one of the hackers' addresses has interacted with at least three crypto platforms. ""We can see that one address was interacted with addresses that related to several digital currency payment processors --CoinPayments, Coinbase, and BitPay,"" Itsik Levy, co-founder and CEO of Whitestream told The Block.

Indeed, a BitPay spokesperson confirmed to The Block: ""BitPay confirms a purchase occurred at one of its merchants in the amount of $25 in May 2020 from one of the Twitter hacker’s addresses. As part of BitPay’s standard process and procedure, available details are being shared with appropriate parties including law enforcement.""

CoinPayments declined to comment to The Block, while Coinbase did not return requests for comment.

Blockchain Intelligence Group, on the other hand, said some of the stolen bitcoin also got sent to Binance.

Indeed, a Binance spokesperson confirmed to The Block that ""a small amount of BTC (equivalent to about $10) was sent to a Binance core wallet address. It seems they [hackers] made the move to confuse blockchain researchers.""



According to The Block Research, Kraken and Binance-acquired Indian crypto exchange WazirX also received some portion of the stolen bitcoin.",,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200720005148/en/Mastercard-Accelerates-Crypto-Card-Partner-Program-Making-it-Easier-for-Consumers-to-Hold-and-Activate-Cryptocurrencies,"PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Consumer interest and investment in digital currencies are growing, with research showing that up to 20 percent of the population of some countries are holding cryptocurrencies1, and an increasing number of merchants, digital players and financial institutions are exploring crypto payments.

Aiding adoption and creating innovative experiences in the crypto space, Mastercard today announced the expansion of its cryptocurrency program, making it simpler and faster for partners to bring secure, compliant payment cards to market. Supercharging the partnership experience, cryptocurrency and crypto card partners are invited to join Mastercard’s Accelerate program2 for emerging brands and fintechs, giving them access to everything they need to grow quickly.

The move comes as Wirex becomes the first native cryptocurrency platform to be granted a Mastercard principal membership, allowing it to directly issue payment cards.

“The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today’s digital economy,” said Raj Dhamodharan, Executive Vice President, Digital Asset and Blockchain Products and Partnerships, Mastercard. “Our work with Wirex and the wider crypto ecosystem is accelerating innovation and empowering consumers with more choice in the way they pay.”

Accepted at Millions of Merchants Worldwide

Mastercard principal membership enables Wirex to issue payment cards directly to consumers, making it easier for people to buy, hold and exchange multiple traditional and cryptocurrencies. Consumers can instantly convert their cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat currency, which can be spent everywhere Mastercard is accepted around the world. Currency will always enter Mastercard’s network as traditional fiat currency. Users will also benefit from Wirex’s Cryptoback™ rewards program, which automatically gives customers up to 1.5% back in Bitcoin for every purchase made in-store.

“We are very excited for Wirex to be the first crypto-native company granted principal membership from Mastercard,” said Pavel Matveev, CEO and co-founder of Wirex. “It represents a growing interest and recognition in the acceptance of cryptocurrency by leading bodies and regulators and will help us to realize our vision of empowering everyone to experience a world where all currencies, traditional and crypto, are equal.”

Regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority with a license to issue cards in Europe, Wirex has been growing rapidly over the past 18 months, with a successful expansion into the Asia Pacific region and the release of its native Wirex Token (WXT). Later this year, the company plans to launch a next generation of Wirex card for customers in Europe, with features including additional currencies and free international ATM withdrawals. Wirex also plans to start issuing corporate cards for Wirex Business clients.

Mastercard’s Accelerate program provides a simple, single entry point to the company’s wide range of specialized programs and gives crypto partners and other fintechs support and assistance for every stage of their growth and transformation, from market entry to global expansion.

Enhancing with the program for crypto card partners, Mastercard has streamlined its approval processes to reduce the time to market for partner products while maintaining its commitment to its principles for partnerships. Mastercard will only work with crypto partners that follow its core principles. Cryptocurrency partnerships must:

Provide strong consumer protection, including privacy and security of the consumers’ information and transactions;

On July 20, Mastercard said it was simplifying access to its Accelerate program for crypto card issuers, allowing applicants to be onboarded as partners “in a matter of weeks.”

Now enhanced for crypto card applicants, the Accelerate program gives partners support with their market entry, continued growth and international expansion.

New crypto partners will be assisted in integrating Mastercard’s technology and will be in a position to benefit from the firm’s cybersecurity expertise and market research.

While it is streamlining access to its program for crypto firms, Mastercard has emphasized that all partners must comply with its “core principles.”

These include providing robust consumer protection (ensuring privacy and security for users), operating in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as Anti-Money Laundering rules, and establishing a level playing field for all stakeholders, such as financial institutions, merchants and mobile network operators.

Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships at Mastercard, said:

“The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today’s digital economy.”

Wirex becomes Mastercard’s first crypto partner with principal membership

Parallel to reaching out to crypto card partners, Mastercard has also announced that London-based crypto payment processor Wirex has become the first native cryptocurrency platform to be granted a Mastercard principal membership, which will allow it to directly issue crypto payment cards.

Thanks to the membership, Wirex card users will be able to immediately convert their crypto holdings into fiat currency, which can be spent at points of sale that accept Mastercard. Currency will thus enter Mastercard’s network in the form of fiat, not cryptocurrency.

Wirex CEO and co-founder Pavel Matveev has said that the membership “represents a growing interest and recognition in the acceptance of cryptocurrency by leading bodies and regulators.” He added that partnering with Mastercard will help the firm to realize its “vision of empowering everyone to experience a world where all currencies, traditional and crypto, are equal.”

Wirex is regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority and has a license to issue crypto cards in Europe. Earlier this year, it hit over 3 million active users, noting that increasing numbers of them are “not typically hardcore cryptocurrency users.”

Prior to partnering with Wirex, Mastercard collaborated with blockchain payments provider BitPay this June to launch a prepaid card for crypto users in the United States.",,https://fortune.com/2020/07/20/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-trade-public-stock-market-first-time/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-07-20 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/36183/stablecoins-help-ethereum-pass-bitcoin-daily-settlement-value,"In brief The stablecoin monetary base increased by $3.8 billion in the last quarter, hitting $12 billion total.

More than 80% of the stablecoin market cap is controlled by USDT.

Ethereum, where most USDT is issued, accounts for over 85% of stablecoin transaction value.

Don’t @ Messari’s Ryan Watkins, Bitcoin maxis. He’s just the analyst.

In findings sure to bring out the Bitcoin reply guys, Messari researcher Ryan Watkins found in his Q2 review of stablecoins that, after nearly reaching parity with Bitcoin for daily settlement value in the first quarter of 2020, Ethereum “[blew] past Bitcoin” in the second quarter.

The settlement figures add another feather in the cap of Ethereum, which has been the main public blockchain for stablecoins for some time. “All said Ethereum accounts for more than 65% of all stablecoins issued, and more than 85% of stablecoin transaction value,” Watkins wrote.

In Watkins’ analysis, stablecoin volumes have corresponded with two recent trends. The first is the COVID-related financial panic. In the last quarter, the amount of money in circulation increased by $3.8 billion dollars after growing by $2.4 billion the previous quarter.

Most of that growth was from USDT stablecoin, better known as Tether. It now accounts for more than $10 billion of the stablecoin market cap of $12 billion. In more unsettling news for the most maximal of Bitcoin maximalists, “USDT alone may very soon surpass Bitcoin as the dominant currency on public blockchains.”

sUSD, launched by Synthetix in January, and Binance Stablecoin (BUSD), which began trading in September of last year, also showed strong growth in relative terms. However, they have some ways to go before catching Tether, the Bitfinex-linked stablecoin that’s been in circulation since 2014.

Though Tether was initially issued on the Bitcoin blockchain, it began issuing instead on Ethereum back in 2017. Tether issues a smaller amount of USDT on the Tron blockchain.

If the upward trajectory of stablecoin settlements seems like good news for stablecoins and the blockchains that issue them, Watkins says that’s because it is.

“What Q2 2020 made clear is that the previous quarter’s growth was not just due to a flight to cash spurred by the initial financial markets turmoil around the coronavirus pandemic,” he noted. “Instead it is that stablecoins, in some respects, offer a superior payments and savings solution.”

But booming stablecoin demand doesn’t just dovetail with COVID. Stablecoin use also correlates with the rise of decentralized finance. Watkins rattled off a list of Q2 DeFi developments: decentralized exchange volumes sometimes hit $500 million a week, Compound’s liquidity mining program led to $800 million in outstanding loans, and more than $2 billion in value was locked up in DeFi tokens. Oh, and the prices of those tokens went up.

“Stablecoins were at the center of all this action, which helped build their utility outside just the payments use case,” noted Watkins.

For those reading Watkins’ report with no small amount of dread that the potential of cryptocurrency is being watered down to optimize it for faster settlements by institutions rather than peer-to-peer payments, Watkins ends on a hopeful coda: “In the long run, stablecoins are not a compromise, they are a trojan horse for permissionless money.”",2020-07-20 22:06:08,https://augustafreepress.com/top-5-influential-investors-in-cryptocurrency/,"Top 5 influential investors in cryptocurrency

The trend of investing in cryptocurrency has shown immense growth over the last few years. Compared to other forms of trading, many people prefer investing in cryptocurrency as it yields them more profits. The more the profits you get, the more the risk you must face. So, trading with cryptocurrency also involves high risk. Most cryptocurrencies are volatile and are stored as digital assets. Several studies say that people gain bulk profits for their lifetime by investing in Ripple and Ethereum. To become a great investor in cryptocurrency, you require a proper understanding of its pattern and market performance.

Many people learned how to trade with cryptocurrency and saw huge profits by investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is everyone’s favorite as it offers a decentralized platform for trading. To motivate new investors, here are the 5 topmost investors, who were the game changers of investing in cryptocurrency.

#1: Nakamoto

Nakamoto owns close to 1 million bitcoins that value 19 billion dollars, which led him to be one of the richest persons in the world. He was the one who introduced and implemented the blockchain system into trading and consequently brought an end to the double-spending problem. The creation of bitcoin carries a history, which remains a mystery. The name Satoshi Nakamoto is used by the creator of bitcoins. It is still unclear whether Nakamoto is a person or a group of people. Whatever the reasons could be, Nakamoto tops the list of attaining huge profits.

#2: Chris Larsen

Chris Larsen is very popular among people who want to enter the market of cryptocurrency. He made his net worth reach around $8 billion by mobilizing cryptocurrencies for top banks and financial institutions. The best thing to know about Chris Larsen is he is the executive chairman and the co-founder of Ripple, which is blockchain software. Ripple has its own currency called XRP, and the software supports in recording and verifying of several transactions and different assets over the cryptocurrency.

#3: Joseph Lubin

Joseph Lubin is the trendsetter of investing and has been a powerful player in the market of the crypto game. He earned a net worth of around 1 billion to 5 billion by being a consistent and successful investor into projects like the bitcoin loophole UK. Interesting information that all of you must know about Lubin is he is one of the Canadian founders of a blockchain platform related to Ethereum. He developed smart thinking towards investing in cryptocurrency inspired by a paper written by Nakamoto, since the inception of cryptocurrency.

#4: Changpeng Zhao

Changpeng Zhao owns the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange called Binance. His friends and followers call him with love and passion as CZ. Very recently, the company launched its own cryptocurrency called Binance coin that adopts the functionality of the Ethereum blockchain. He piled up a crypto wealth of nearly 2 million by enabling more than 6 million users for his product/company. He turned out to be an expert investor in the crypto market after gaining great expertise while serving as a chief technology officer at OKCOIN. He is considered as a real role model cum inspiration for newcomers who want to get into trading with cryptocurrency.

#5: Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss

The twin brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have a great history behind their achievements. With gaining a decent amount of 65 million dollars from the Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerburg, against an indictment, these brothers got into investing in various project ventures that include bitcoin as well. Reports say that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss together own 1% of bitcoins throughout the world, which equals to a net worth of over 1 billion dollars. The brothers have recently launched their own cryptocurrency exchange named Gemini along with Ether which they already hold in their company.

There is no doubt that cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity year on year with the increase in the number of interested investors. Moreover, the present cryptocurrency market encourages new investors and provides a plethora of trading opportunities with the existence of various cryptocurrencies. Despite the changing environment focussing completely on different digital currencies, the growth aspect is always going to be consistent. So new investors can take a chance to invest in cryptocurrency and learn to manage the risks they encounter.

PayPal Picks Paxos

PayPal, the fintech giant planning to bring crypto trading to its massive user base, has chosen Paxos to handle the new service’s supply of digital assets, according to two people familiar with the matter. Paxos launched a brokerage service last week, which provides an API solution to allow businesses to begin offering crypto buying, selling, holding and sending capabilities – while handling all regulatory compliance aspects. It’s unknown what cryptocurrencies PayPal intends to offer, though its entry into the space makes it one of the most mainstream companies to do so.

Wash Trading

Canada-based crypto trading platform Coinsquare has been accused by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) of inflating its trading volumes in an illegal practice called wash trading. In a Statement of Allegations from the OSC, filed last Thursday, the regulator alleges Coinsquare’s executives directed staff to wash trade as much as 90% of the platform’s reported volume between July 2018 and December 2019. The alleged misconduct occurred while Coinsquare was applying to the OSC to register a subsidiary, Coinsquare Capital Markets.

Crypto Cards

Mastercard is expanding its cryptocurrency program by granting Wirex, a crypto payment business, principal membership status. This status makes Wirex the first native crypto company to be able to directly issue payment cards to its customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated-Wirex offers a payment facility that automatically exchanges crypto into fiat currencies.

Custodial Entrant

Standard Chartered’s venture and innovation arm has been working on a crypto custody offering for the institutional market that could be piloted later this year. Alex Manson, the head of SC Ventures, said as many as 20 institutions have expressed interest in the custodial solution. He added, institutional adoption has been hindered by a lack of proper custodial offerings. Initially, SC Ventures had been looking at creating a market service, but realized it had to go a couple of steps back as many wouldn’t touch the digital asset space “with a flagpole” until they had ready access to an institutional-grade storage solution.

Promo Oversight

The U.K. government is looking to increase oversight into cryptocurrency promotions in order to protect investors. On Monday, the country’s Treasury said it would clamp down on “misleading and inadequate promotions” that endangered retail investors, like crypto promotions. John Glen, the City Minister responsible for the U.K.’s financial services sector, said any firm looking to approve the financial promotions from unauthorized firms would first need to have the consent of the Financial Conduct Authority. He added the proposals would bring crypto product promotions up to the same levels as those for other asset-classes.

The big story

Elon Musk’s OpenAI opened its third-generation language processing model to private beta, and crypto is aflutter with prognostications. GPT-3, short for Generative Pre-training Transformer, is a new AI-driven tool that revolutionizes how computers process and produce language.

“When properly primed by a human, it can write creative fiction; it can generate functioning code; it can compose thoughtful business memos; and much more. Its possible use cases are limited only by our imaginations,” Forbes reports.

Fed with nearly all the text available on the internet (roughly 175 billion parameters, or two orders of magnitude larger than its predecessor) GPT-3 can take any chuck of language a human gives it and run wild. It’s the one of the most advanced machine-learning language models to date.

Manuel Araoz, Zeppelin Solutions CTO, already used it to write a 746-word blog about a fake experiment looking at how GPT-3 can be used to deceive Bitcointalk forum members, Decrypt reports. This meta-blog demonstrates how language generators could be employed to create fake news and misinformation.

Araoz wonders whether GPT-3 will be “the biggest thing since bitcoin.” Citing its raw processing power, and Turing Test-passing blogs and tweets, it’s likely this technical edge will have a profound effect on how we judge content – once it’s released to the wild world wide web.

There’s plenty to suggest this tool will deepen the skepticism of online content, but Gwern, a pseudonymous researcher in crypto, has already used it to find beauty.

“GPT-3’s samples are not just close to human level: they are creative, witty, deep, meta, and often beautiful. They demonstrate an ability to handle abstractions, like style parodies, I have not seen in GPT-2 at all,” he writes, after testing it for a week. “Chatting with GPT-3 feels uncannily like chatting with a human.”

Other early testers have their doubts. Delian Asparouhov, a Principal at Founders Fund, cautioned not to “get too excited, this isn’t some sort of general AI, and the machine doesn’t really have a way of understanding if what it is outputting is true or not.”

While GPT-3 can predict language and finish a human being’s sentences, paragraphs, essays, it lacks internal understanding of language. It cannot reason. It cannot create. It can only mimic.

Whether that’s enough to match the revolutionary potential of a self-sovereign financial system is an open question. But it seems like the genie is out of the bottle in both instances.

Futures: Bleak

Trading activity in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has cooled notably as the leading cryptocurrency languishes in the price doldrums. Only 1,895 contracts, representing $87 million in daily trading volume, were placed. This is the lowest level since mid-April. This is one part of a larger trend. Total global daily volume, as calculated by adding numbers from BitMEX, Deribit, Kraken, OKEx, bitFlyer, CoinFlex, CME. Huobi, FTX, Bitfinex, Binance, Bybit, and Bakkt, tanked to $4.65 billion – down 87% from the $36 billion observed on May 11.

Opinion

Two of CoinDesk’s senior-most leaders weigh in on the Twitter hack aftermath in their newsletters: Money Reimagined and Crypto Long & Short. You can sign up to get the full account in your inbox here.

This Isn’t Good for Crypto

“No, blockchain does not fix this,” CoinDesk’s Chief Content Officer Michael Casey begins his weekly newsletter, Money Reimagined. He’s referring to the conversation on social media following the Twitter hack that left heads-of-state, corporate leaders and prominent crypto accounts exposed on Wednesday. Crypto Twitter responded with arguments that the exploit would shake trust in centralized systems and lead to a digital-first, self-sovereign revolution. That may be true, but Crypto Twitter isn’t likely to change any hearts and minds, Casey argues, especially if the community keeps calling its critics “morons.”

On Second Thought

In her latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter, CoinDesk Head of Research Noelle Acheson argues the Twitter hack was good for Bitcoin, though not for the obvious reasons. While some have labeled the event a “bitcoin scam,” and called for the regulation or eradication of crypto, the hack highlights how this would be impossible: “One of the strengths of bitcoin is that it is out of the range of state actors.” This reassurance may assuage the anxieties of interested, though cautious, investors waiting for regulatory clarity. Further, because Bitcoin is built on a public ledger, a trail of the hacker’s conduct is in full view. “This should reassure regulators that bitcoin-related crime is not the threat to society some skeptics claim.”

Bitcoin’s First Metric

What are bitcoin days destroyed (BDD)? CoinDesk’s research team dive in to give a complete overview of what’s thought to be Bitcoin’s first on-chain metric.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-07-20 16:07:45+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-futures-trading-volume-slips-to-3-month-low-on-cme,"Trading activity in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has cooled notably as the leading cryptocurrency languishes in the price doldrums.

Daily trading volume fell to $87 million (via 1,895 contracts) on Friday to hit the lowest level since April 17, when the exchange-traded contracts were worth $77 million, according to data from crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Volume topped out at $914 million on May 11 – the day bitcoin underwent its third miner reward halving – and has been on a declining trend ever since.

The halving was widely expected to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency. Instead, bitcoin’s uptrend from March lows below $4,000 stalled following the halving, and the cryptocurrency has remained largely locked in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 ever since.

The unusually quiet period for bitcoin trading seems to be the primary reason behind the steady decline in CME’s futures volume.

Global daily volume, as calculated by adding numbers from BitMEX, Deribit, Kraken, OKEx, bitFlyer, CoinFlex, CME. Huobi, FTX, Bitfinex, Binance, Bybit, and Bakkt, has also tanked over the past two months.

BTC futures global volume Source: Skew

As of Sunday, aggregate daily volume was just $4.65 billion, down 87% from the $36 billion observed on May 11.

“Continued range trading and an inability to confidently break above $10,000 has led investors to allocate capital into other segments of the crypto market,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Indeed, alternative cryptocurrencies like the oracle network Chainlink’s LINK token, Stellar’s XLM and tokens associated with the decentralized finance (DeFi) space like Compound’s LEND have received greater attention from the investor community over the past week or two.

Tokens like LINK and XLM have witnessed a surge in trading volumes in the spot market this month, while bitcoin’s volume in both the spot market and futures market has declined.

Monthly volumes: LINK, XLM, BTC Source: TradingView

LINK’s trading volume on Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, has increased by 67%, while XLM’s volume has jumped by nearly 40% to new record highs. Meanwhile, bitcoin trading has diminished for the third straight month.

“With the hype around the DeFi, this trend may continue for the short-term,” Dibb said in a direct chat with CoinDesk.

CME open interest down too

Open interest, or open positions in futures, listed on the CME (which is considered synonymous with institutional participation) has also declined along with the daily trading volume. As of Friday, $364 million worth of positions were open on the CME – down 31% from the high of $532 million observed on May 19.

However, aggregate or global open interest remains elevated near $4 billion, the highest level since early March.

Aggregate open interest Source: Skew

Derivative analysts consider the combination of declining trading volume and elevated open interest as a sign of investors holding on to their positions. In such cases, markets usually extend the preceding move, meaning bitcoin could break above $10,000 in the near-term, marking a continuation of the uptrend from the March low of $3,867.",2020-07-20 11:37:56+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/regulation/uk-gov-to-bring-crypto-adverts-into-fcas-oversight-of-financial-promotions/,"The UK Government is proposing to bring the promotion of crypto-assets into the scope of the FCA’s existing oversight, rather than creating a new framework specifically for these products.

Citing concern over investor protection, the economic secretary to the Treasury & City Minister, John Glen, said that even companies that sell regulated investments with an underlying cryptocurrency element might need FCA authorization to do so depending on their activities.

“If adverts by unauthorised firms are misleading, or don’t fully outline the risks, then people can end up losing money. That’s why we want to put more protections in place around such financial promotions, including the promotion of cryptoassets, while continuing to ensure people have access to a wide range of products on the market,” said Glen.

Providing the FCA with power to regulate the promotion of certain types of cryptoassets, for the first time, would be the quickest way of doing this and stamping out misleading advertising.

HM Treasury said that a dearth of regulation around cryptocurrencies and revenant financial products had left investors exposed to many risks without any of the protections usually afforded to retail investors, such as access to compensation.

Britons want to get rich quick

The City Minister further explains that the current regulation requires unauthorized firms to get their promotions approved by a regulated firm before they can promote a particular financial product. This, however, failed to keep up with the expanding number of cryptocurrency products coming to market. Instead, he proposes that even regulated firms need to pass through the FCA’s gateway and obtain a specific consent before being approved to promote cryptocurrency products.

The FCA has recently published the findings of independent complementary research, which showed that UK consumers buying virtual coins are often looking for ways to ‘get rich quick.’ Many of those interviewed perceived crypto assets as a shortcut to easy money and wealth.

According to the FCA, crypto fraudsters were increasingly using social media to promote their schemes, often using fake celebrity endorsements and images of expensive cars and watches to persuade victims.

The City watchdog is already weighing a potential ban on the sale of derivatives based on cryptocurrencies, in what would be its first major intervention in the nascent market. The aforementioned consultation could lead to prohibiting the sale of derivatives, including CFDs, options, and futures, based on cryptocurrency prices to retail investors.

Take a look at the market capitalization of ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the value stands at about $26 billion. But that figure doesn’t include all of the digital assets built atop the Ethereum blockchain, including some of this year’s hottest tokens: stablecoins like tether and USDC and altcoins like Crypto.com’s CRO, Chainlink’s LINK, Compound’s COMP and Kyber’s KNC.

The combined value of those ERC-20-standard tokens is also around $26 billion, according to the data provider Messari. That puts the market capitalization of the Ethereum ecosystem at more than $50 billion – closer to bitcoin‘s $170 billion than if ether were considered alone.

The comparison shows how the rapid pace of development this year on Ethereum has brought the blockchain’s ecosystem closer to challenging Bitcoin. The value gap narrowed over the past month as bitcoin’s price stagnated, while demand for stablecoins and a flurry of activity in “decentralized finance,” known as DeFi, has ignited the value of Ethereum and the tokens that depend on it.

“DeFi tokens continue their bull run,” cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock wrote Monday in a weekly commentary.

Messari, a digital-asset data firm, said in a report that the Ethereum blockchain’s daily settlement value recently surged to about $2.5 billion, surpassing Bitcoin’s for the first time since at least early 2019.

“Ethereum has blown past Bitcoin,” Ryan Watkins, a Messari analyst, wrote in the post on Monday. “With the increasing amount of economic activity taking place on Ethereum, this trend is unlikely to reverse anytime soon, if ever.”

It’s the latest chapter in the competition among projects to attain critical mass in the cryptocurrency industry. For entrepreneurs and investors in the space, the goal is to establish networks and projects with enough name recognition, credibility and functionality to scale quickly if and when mass adoption comes. Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, attracted most of the hype early in 2020 as some analysts predicted a once-every-four-years event known as the blockchain’s “halving” could send prices to $90,000. Bitcoin got another bluster of endorsements as the spreading coronavirus slammed the global economy, sending traditional markets plunging and prompting the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to create trillions of dollars of fresh money.

Many investors predicted that the money injections would debase the dollar’s purchasing power, driving up the price of bitcoin. Yet over the past couple months, bitcoin’s price has stagnated below $10,000, and even its notorious volatility has withered – prompting fickle crypto traders to seek faster-moving action.

Bitcoin has been stuck in a tight trading range for weeks, boring for a market that used to be known for its thrills. However, there are signs Tuesday that an expected big move may be building.

Still, Ether’s price is up 81% in 2020 to $237, almost three times bitcoin’s 30% year-to-date gain.

Steve Ehrlich, CEO of publicly traded cryptocurrency brokerage firm Voyager Digital, says bitcoin has accounted for about 15% of trading volumes so far in July, down from about 60% prior to the May halving.

“We’ve seen a tremendous change in our retail customer behaviors,” Ehrlich said Monday in a phone interview. “When bitcoin is extremely flat in the marketplace, people are looking at other tokens.”

In terms of name recognition and popularity outside of the crypto industry, Bitcoin still dominates. According to a report last week from the trading platform eToro and data provider The TIE, only four stories about DeFi appeared in June in “non-crypto news sources,” versus some 200 about bitcoin.

“There is a growing realization though that the 2020 DeFi hype may be overdone,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in an e-mail to subscribers.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant, said that ethereum risks becoming a victim of its own success, activity in the tokens built atop the blockchain are driving up transaction fees.

“This resurgence in the network performance has come with a raft of undesired consequences,” Vinokourov wrote in emailed remarks.

And Jimmy Song, a well-known bitcoin developer and promoter, told the website CoinMarketCap in an interview published last week that he thinks many DeFi projects will fail to live up to their “decentralized” billing because “they almost always have to have some sort of back door in case something goes wrong.”

“It’s really just a form of gambling with limited upside for people that aren’t in control of the protocol,” Song said.

For now, though, the Ethereum ecosystem is edging closer.

Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative firm Kronos Research, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey that he sees ether hitting $500 by the end of this year. That would more than double ether’s market capitalization, to say nothing of any potential increases in the value of ERC-20 tokens.

“Ethereum the platform has done its job,” the cryptocurrency investment firm Arca wrote Monday in a weekly blog post.

Traders are apparently doing their jobs too – following the action.

BTC: Price: $9,347 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,363 | 24-Hr Low: $9,152

Trend: Bitcoin is showing signs of life on Tuesday with prices trading above $9,340 at press time, representing a 1.9% gain on the day. Notably, the cryptocurrency hasn’t witnessed an over 1% move since July 9.

The four-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has broken higher from the four-week-long narrowing price range. The breakout is backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the relative strength index. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is printing higher bars above the zero line, a sign the upward move may gather pace.

The immediate resistance at $9,480 – a lower high created on July 9 – could be put to test over the next few hours.

Acceptance above that level would confirm a Bollinger band (volatility indicator) breakout on the daily chart and may yield a rally to $10,000.

The bias would turn bearish if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance under $9,000. However, sellers have failed multiple times in the last two months to establish a foothold below that psychological support.",2020-07-21 12:08:06+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-briefly-pops-above-9400-as-global-stocks-rally,"Bitcoin hit its highest price point in almost two weeks as stocks climbed.

“Bitcoin might be waking up,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at London-based crypto brokerage Koine. “A close above $9,600 would be a strong sign.”

Some are just happy to see prices go up in the bitcoin market, which has lacked activity for much of July.

“Nice to finally see a bit of movement,” said Douglas Bilyk, a director at New York-based crypto brokerage Copper. “With lower volumes, it doesn’t take as much to push it, and looks like the initial move was up. Now we just need to see some follow-through.”

Major global equities are also showing positive gains today:

Gains in the equity markets appear to have been the catalyst for bitcoin’s positive trading day. “Bitcoin seems pretty correlated to equities at the moment,” Koine’s Douglas told CoinDesk. “The test will be whether BTC can hold up if equities sell off.”

Stock indices have been outperforming bitcoin in July. However, Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, points out that flat markets for the oldest cryptocurrency sometimes can occur.

“This lull isn’t uncharacteristic of bitcoin; it spent most of Q1 2019 in a sideways market,” he said.

“Expectations are always running high for performance. And though it’s a well-run narrative by now, bitcoin has a tendency to exhibit a high volatility; things will move again,” Shah added.

Curve DEX volumes up

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $245 and and climbing 4.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

Ethereum-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) Curve Finance is seeing huge growth in volumes this past week. Curve, at $70 million in volume over the past 24 hours, has overtaken bellwether DEX Uniswap as decentralized finance (DeFi) heats up.

“It is probably a bit of interest picking up in non-bitcoin assets that are becoming multifunctional or yield-enhancing,” said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading for Chicago-based liquidity provider Blockfills.

Jake Brukhman, managing partner for New York-based crypto asset manager CoinFund, said Curve’s specialization in swapping stablecoins gives the DEX an edge in execution.

When DeFi traders seeking opportunities need to arbitrage stable assets, Curve’s volume increases.

“They are using a mathematical equation which makes slippage very low,” Brukhman said.

High-profile Twitter account holders, including former US president Barack Obama along with Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, presumptive Democratic candidate for president Joe Biden among others, on Wednesday (July 15), were the target of a Bitcoin-related scam. The well-orchestrated hack posted similar tweets, all instructing people to send Bitcoins to an unknown cryptocurrency wallet.

More than 373 users fell for the scam, losing a total of INR 89 Lakh before the Tweets were removed by the Twitter authority. “The attacker had complete access to Twitter — they could have posted anything from any of the official accounts, but they chose to seek Bitcoins through false promises,” shared Arjun Vijay, cofounder and COO of Giottus Cryptocurrency.

Further, he said people should be more careful, and there is no easy money, and most crypto giveaways that ask for contributions are scams. “We hope this brings awareness, and Twitter users do not fall for these kinds of scams again,” Vijay added.

In the Bitcoin-scam aftermath, Twitter had temporarily blocked all high-profile verified accounts from posting or even changing their passwords while it investigated and sought to resolve the issue. Twitter said that it will provide more details on the issue in the future as and when the investigation unfolds.

Based on what we know right now, we believe approximately 130 accounts were targeted by the attackers in some way as part of the incident. For a small subset of these accounts, the attackers were able to gain control of the accounts and then send Tweets from those accounts. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 17, 2020

According to the New York Times report, four young hackers were involved in the well-organised Twitter scam. The report stated that the Bitcoin scam was traced back to a group of hackers who met at OGusers.com, a username-swapping community where people buy and sell online handles. The Times noted that the Twitter hack is not from Russian or other sophisticated hacker groups but was done by a group of young people, ‘one of whom says he lives at home with his mother.’

Accordingly, two users, ‘lol’ and ‘ever so anxious’ came into contact with ‘Kirk,’ who had access to most sensitive tools, which allowed him to take control of almost any Twitter account, including the 130 high-profile accounts that were being hacked, the report added.

According to Twitter’s blog, the hackers targeted Twitter employees through a social engineering scheme. In other words, social engineering schemes are the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and revealing confidential information. Further, it stated that the attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems.

“As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts,” Twitter added.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of writing was $9,172.20 with a market cap of $169.11 Bn, compared to last week (July 14, 2020) which stood at $9,186.59, with a market cap of $169.32 Bn.

Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, was priced at $237.35, with a market cap of $26.54 Bn at the time of writing, compared to last week (July 14, 2020), where the price of the cryptocurrency was $227.24, with a market cap of $25.35 Bn.

The new draft is more neutral. It suggests crypto is a kind of property that cannot be accepted as a means of payment. Any lawsuits related to the ownership of crypto can only be considered by the courts if plaintiffs report their crypto holdings and deals for tax purposes.

This might change the currently inconsistent practice in the Russian courts, where there is no universal definition of cryptocurrency.

A digital currency, according to the bill, is a digital set of data that can be used as a payment method or investment tool and has no central party responsible for it, “except for the operator and (or) the nodes of such systems, which are only responsible for maintaining the issuance of the digital data and upending such a system.”

The issuance and flow of crypto in Russia should be regulated by other laws, the bills says. The bill’s sponsor, Anatoly Aksakov, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti more detailed regulations might be passed during the next parliamentary session in the fall.

The bill passed the second hearing today, which is the most important one in the Russian lawmaking process. There are three rounds of hearings for any bill to pass, but after the second one, the text of a bill is considered final. The document, which was initially only dedicated to regulating digital securities, ultimately merely included a mention of digital currency and its basic definition.

The main part of the bill, however, outlines the regulations for assets like digital shares of a company, whether on a distributed ledger or in “another kind of system.” The issuers of such assets should register with the Bank of Russia, and have managers with experience in finance. The issuer of such a system should control it in a centralized way and should be able to amend the ledger in case a court rules so.

The law is supposed to come into force in January 2021. It won’t change much for the cryptocurrency industry in Russia, says lawyer Mikhail Uspensky.

“The only thing outright prohibited is taking crypto as payment for goods and services, which was the Bank of Russia’s principal premise. But buying a cup of coffee for bitcoin is still a kind of exotic thing anyway,” Uspensky said.

He added that the current version of the bill is a compromise between the conservatively inclined Bank of Russia, other government bodies and the crypto community.",2020-07-21 18:41:02+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/100x-ventures-leads-3-4m-funding-round-of-south-african-crypto-exchange/,"VALR, one of South Africa’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has secured 57 million rands (around $3.4 million) in a recently closed Series A funding round.

It aims to help crypto exchanges and similar businesses freeze transactions that may be linked to criminals before those transactions can be confirmed on the blockchain.

CipherTrace hopes to aid crypto businesses steer clear of funds derived from criminal activity.

DARPA-backed blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace today unveiled “predictive capabilities” for its crypto tracing software—a move designed to better help cryptocurrency exchanges and similar businesses flag and freeze transactions that may be linked to criminal behavior.

The new tools, which include real-time analytics and predictive risk scoring, are now available for existing customers and will be offered to new clients at the end of July, according to the firm.

The launch comes at an opportune time. Just last week, the tech world was rocked by a massive Twitter hack that saw scammers take over more than 100 high-profile accounts to push a Bitcoin scam. The scam pulled in more than $120,000 in Bitcoin from unsuspecting Twitter followers, before crypto exchanges like Coinbase began freezing transactions to the scammer’s wallet address.

CipherTrace’s latest tech, though it isn’t novel in the industry, aims to help exchanges be even quicker on the draw.

In an interview with Decrypt, John Jefferies—chief financial analyst at CipherTrace—explained how it works: Bitcoin transactions will be scored using the company’s money monitoring system and algorithm before being committed to the blockchain, he said.

“Exchanges, [crypto] ATMs, [over-the-counter] desks, hedge funds, and other [virtual asset service providers] use our software to score transactions as they flow into their platforms,” he said. “By ingesting data from the blockchain, our AI scores transactions from low to high money laundering risk based on whether the funds have been tainted.”

Before being confirmed to the blockchain, BTC transactions are stored in what’s known as a mempool and must await validation. It can take anywhere between 10 minutes to several hours before transactions are confirmed and finalized on the blockchain. CipherTrace’s tech aims to help exchanges and other businesses identify “risky” transactions before they are final.

CipherTrace labels a transaction as potentially high risk when it discovers data suggesting an address involved in the transaction can be attributed to a sanctioned region or entity. The data may also place the address in one of the following categories: criminal, dark market, gambling, malware, ransomware, or mixer.

The idea is to help crypto businesses steer clear of unlawfully gained funds from criminals or even terrorists.

“Risk scoring is based on the source of funds,” Jefferies explained. “When transactions enter the mempool, CipherTrace can see these risky transactions and know where they came from before they are written to the blockchain. This allows our customers to ‘see into the future’ and stop the funds while they’re on route to a [virtual asset service provider].”

According to Jefferies, CipherTrace has visibility into roughly 87% of the global trading volume and boasts hundreds of millions of attribution data points. It’s this, he said, that allows the crypto tracing firm to decipher which funds are clean and which ones may be linked to criminals.",2020-07-21 18:06:04

The announcement, issued Wednesday, ""applies to national banks and federal savings associations of all sizes"" and states that such custody services represent ""a modern form of traditional bank activities related to custody services."" The move comes just over a month after the OCC sought public input on the digital activities of such institutions, including in the area of digital assets and blockchain, and represents a significant sea change in the U.S. banking sector's relationship with the nascent cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Published alongside its statement was an interpretive letter outlining the policy shift. Though unnamed, the letter cites a request ""regarding the authority of a national bank to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers."" The following section provides an overview of cryptocurrencies before outlining the particulars of what exactly constitutes custody.

""Because digital currencies exist only on the blockchain or distributed ledger on which they are stored, there is no physical possession of the instrument. Instead, the right to a particular unit of digital currency is transferred from party to party by the use of unique cryptographic keys. Therefore, a bank 'holding' digital currencies on behalf of a customer is actually taking possession of the cryptographic access keys to that unit of cryptocurrency,"" the letter notes.

The letter cites existing OCC guidance, which outlines that ""that banks may hold a wide variety of assets as custodians, including assets that are unique and hard to value. These custody activities often include assets that transfer electronically.""

The OCC goes on to note:

""Providing custody services for cryptocurrency falls within these longstanding authorities to engage in safekeeping and custody activities. As discussed below, this is a permissible form of a traditional banking activity that national banks are authorized to perform via electronic means. Providing such services is permissible in both non-fiduciary and fiduciary capacities. A bank that provides custody for cryptocurrency in a non-fiduciary capacity would essentially provide safekeeping for the cryptographic key that allows for control and transfer of the customer's cryptocurrency.""

Still, the regulator notes that any institution looking to provide crypto custody services should ""develop and implement those activities consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the bank's overall business plans and strategies as set forth in OCC guidance."" What's more, those banks must put in place ""policies, procedures, internal controls, and management information systems governing custody services. Effective internal controls include safeguarding assets under custody, producing reliable financial reports, and complying with laws and regulations,"" according to the OCC. In sum, the OCC wants banks that pursue this line of business to understand precisely what they're getting themselves into when dealing with the particulars of handling and safeguarding cryptocurrencies.

In a statement, Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks — a former chief legal officer for crypto exchange Coinbase who took office less than two months ago after the departure of Joseph Otting — celebrated the guidance release.

""From safe-deposit boxes to virtual vaults, we must ensure banks can meet the financial services needs of their customers today,"" Brooks remarked. ""This opinion clarifies that banks can continue satisfying their customers' needs for safeguarding their most valuable assets, which today for tens of millions of Americans includes cryptocurrency.""",,https://fortune.com/2020/07/22/bitcoin-big-banks-can-hold-occ-letter/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-07-22 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-2020-defi-boom-doubles-active-ether-addresses-but-fees-skyrocket/,"Ethereum's 2020 Defi Boom Doubles Active Ether Addresses, But Fees Skyrocket

The number of active Ethereum addresses has grown aggressively in 2020 because of the decentralized finance (defi) boom. Active Ethereum addresses doubled in size leaving networks like Tron, Cardano, and EOS in the dust.

There’s a lot happening in the world of decentralized finance (defi) with things like synthetic bitcoin (WBTC), stablecoins, yield farming, decentralized exchange (dex) platforms, and more crafted on the Ethereum network. Since the end of 2019, data from Coin Metrics and Messari.io indicates that Ethereum addresses doubled in size throughout the year.

Active ETH addresses have superseded BTC active addresses by a long shot and this has been sparked by 2020’s defi bonanza. Additionally, decentralized exchange (dex) trade volumes have touched $1.6 billion this month and there were $160 million in dex swaps during the last 24 hours. The top three platforms today as far as the most exchange volume today include Curve, Balancer, and Dydx according to Dune Analytics.

Data also shows the number of ETH-based smart contract platform active addresses has outpaced other Ethereum competitors. Coins like TRX, EOS, ADA, and XTZ have been eclipsed. However, Messari researcher Wilson Withiam tweeted about the defi situation and Ethereum’s smart contract war competitors.

“In the last year, thirteen Ethereum competitors have raked in over $300 million combined,” Withiam said. “Almost all were valued well north of $100 million.”

Ethereum is also seeing a significant amount of stablecoin use between all the ERC20-based stablecoins buzzing around the network. One of the biggest ETH-based smart contracts is the most popular stablecoin in the world, tether (USDT). According to Etherscan stats, there’s a whopping 6,037,847,550 USDTs in circulation using the ERC20 standard.

Moreover, the great number of other stablecoin projects in existence like Dai (DAI), Usd coin (USDC), Trueusd (TUSD), and Pax standard (PAX) are all ERC20 tokens. Ethereum is also doing some heavy lifting for the BTC chain and acting as a fluid sidechain. There is $114 million total-value-locked (TVL) in the ERC20 token called WBTC that is backed 1:1 by bitcoin (BTC). Other chains like renBTC and sBTC are moving synthetic BTC on the Ethereum chain as well.

All of this action taking place in the Ethereum ecosystem has developed a large number of active Ethereum addresses but there have been a number of issues. The fees needed to interact with an ERC20 smart contract has been high and cryptocurrency proponents have been complaining about the issue regularly.

For instance, it cost over $4 and 100 MANA to register a name (interact with a smart contract using Metamask) on Decentraland on July 21, 2020. Fees have been a significant nuisance to Ethereum users yield farming and interacting with defi as some gas fees have reached 100 gwei.

Ethereum’s cofounder Vitalik Buterin said on Tuesday that the transaction fee revenue could possibly undermine the chain’s security.

“Transaction fee revenue is now nearing half as high as block reward revenue,” Buterin tweeted. “This actually risks making ethereum *less* secure because of fee market reform (ie. EIP 1559) fixes this; another reason why that EIP is important.”

Additionally, the management team behind Maker and the Compound project community have been at odds lately as gainful DAI yield on Compound has created stability issues for the stablecoin DAI. The discussion has been very topical for individuals like Cyrus Younessi, the Head of Risk at the Maker project.

Another controversial discussion in regard to stablecoin use on the Ethereum chain is the fact that a number of stablecoin addresses from USDT and USDC have been frozen. A number of skeptics believe that the ability to blacklist a token via an Ethereum smart contract threatens defi and puts the term “decentralized finance” into question.

Barack Obama: one of the targets of the scam

A failed bitcoin scam by hackers accessing the Twitter accounts of global politicians and business leaders proved the resilience of the cryptocurrency, it has been claimed.

Former US president Barack Obama along with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon leader Jeff Bezos were among those targeted.

The hackers – a team of four, according to the New York Times – posted tweets instructing individuals to send bitcoins to an unknown cryptocurrency wallet. A total of $123,000 worth of BTC (bitcoin) is understood to have been sent via more than 400 transactions.

Some of this activity was thought to be the hackers transferring bitcoin to inflate, and thus attempt to legitimise, the activity. Seventeen transactions involved more than $1,000.

According to the Times, the scam was traced back to a group of hackers who met at OGusers.com, a username-swapping community where people buy and sell online handles.

Twitter temporarily blocked all high-profile verified accounts from posting while it investigated and sought to resolve the issue. It said it will provide more details on the issue as the investigation develops.

Katharine Wooller: ‘cryptos’ transparency is its strength’

Katharine Wooller, managing director of Dacxi UK & Eire, a Singapore-headquartered crypto exchange, said: “The crypto naysayers were quick to delight in bitcoin as the criminals’ currency of choice.

“This somewhat misses the point however. The hack is humiliating for Twitter; at a time where the power of the largest tech firms and their policies are under scrutiny. Let’s be honest, to be caught out by a social engineering hack, for a social media company, is hugely embarrassing.”

Ms Wooller points out that within hours of the hack, blockchain analysts had pieced together the hacker’s timeline, and tracked the resulting bitcoin transactions. Whilst the wallets in question may not have an associated name and address, they are part of a ledger, which anyone can monitor.

“Critics are concerned over the centralisation, and dominance of social media platforms,” she said. “In contrast cryptos’ decentralised nature and transparency is its strength.

“Regulation, of course, needs to keep the crypto industry accountable. In the UK, the regulatory authority is taking crypto seriously and rightly so.”

The FCA’s June research note showed that 3.86% of the general population currently own cryptocurrencies.

Ms Wooller admits that too many exchanges are not complying with the rules.

If some of the biggest names in the world of politics, showbiz and business can be used in an attempted hijack, then, really anything is possible – Katherine Wooller, Dacxi

“Let us be clear, press coverage to warn unsuspecting users of scams is crucial. However, as the industry matures, coupled with reputable businesses with a UK presence, it seems that the retail audience is savvy, and, more importantly increasingly comfortable with crypto and its potential.

“Some of the media appears to sway towards Bitcoin being the tool for scammers and as some of the phishing attempts via email and social media get every more sophisticated, it is becoming clear that that vigilance is key.

“If some of the biggest names in the world of politics, showbiz and business can be used in an attempted hijack, then, really anything is possible. Lessons need to be learned.

“However, let us not close our minds to the fact that bitcoin was used as a ‘ransom note’ on a digital social media platform.

“Is it really any different to criminals handing a note over the counter of a bank or post office demanding the contents from the safe? As a result, the world never stopped using cash and neither will anyone stop investing in bitcoin.”

Bitcoin resumes the sidelined trading with bearish bias after a failure to clear the local resistance

ETH/BTC struggles to stay above pivotal area of $0.02600.

The cryptocurrency market slowed down again after an initial attempt to develop bullish momentum. Bitcoin and major altcoins settled above local resistance levels, but the further upside impulse has faded away. Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach as the high level of uncertainty limits their appetite for active trading.

As coronavirus threats eased, policymakers and regulators shifted their attention to the regulation and taxation of digital assets. Thus, Russia has made some progress with its DIgital Law, while South Korea finalized the cryptocurrency income tax legislation. Traders and investors with the annual income from cryptocurrency trading over 2.5 million KRW will have to pay an income tax of 20%. Also, China speeds up the development of the state-backed blockchain infrastructure to cement its leading role in the development of this emerging technology.

At the opening of the European session, Bitcoin is hovering below $9,400, mostly unchanged both on a day-to-day basis and since the beginning of. Ethereum settled above $243.00 after a short-lived jump to $245.00, while XRP is changing hands at $0.1980.

NEO is the best-performing asset out of top-30 with nearly 7% of gains on a day-to-day basis. The coin with the current market value of $792 million takes the 21st place in the global cryptocurrency market rating.

Stock markets edged lower amid growing geopolitical tensions. US and China conflict flare up as the U.S. ordered China’s Houston consulate to quickly close on IP issues. Traders are concerned that the deteriorating relationship might increase pressure on the global economy.

ETH/BTC Daily Chart

ETH/BTC is currently trading at 0.02600. The cross settled above the local resistance after a spike to $0.2625 on Tuesday. The support is now created by the upward-looking middle line of the daily Bollinger Band at $0.02578. ETH/BTC needs to stay above 0.026, to retain the bullish bias in the short run. The 50-day Simple Moving Average has flattened at 0.02524. If it is broken, the price may drop to 0.024 with 100-day located above this area.

Above the current price, the first resistance level is at 0.02626, then the second at 0.0264 and the third one at 0.0270.

BTC/USD Daily Chart

BTC/USD is currently trading at $9,330. The first digital coin struggles to stay above 50-day SMA as the upside momentum faded away on approach to $9,400 reinforced by the upper line of the daily Bollinger Band. BTC/USD has stayed mostly unchanged both on a day-to-day basis and since the beginning of Wednesday. A sustainable move below $9,200 will worsen the short-term picture, while a critical support is still created by the psychological barrier of $9,000. The upward-looking 100-day SMA reinforces the channel support and separates the coin from an extended sell-off towards 200-day SMA at $8,550 zone.

Above the current price, the first resistance level is at $9,500, then the second at $10,000 and the third one at $10,400.

ETH/USD Daily Chart

ETH/USD is currently trading at $243.43 supported by the 50-day SMA coupled with the middle line of the daily Bollinger Band on approach to $236. If it is broken, the downside momentum may gain traction and push the price towards 100-day SMA100 above $218; however, the critical support is created by 200-day simple moving average on approach to $200 level. This area will serve as a good backstop for the coin. On the upside, the next resistance is created by the upper line of the daily Bollinger Band at $248.

Above the current price, the first resistance level is at $260, then the second at $270 and the third one at $300.

Below the current price, the first support level is at $240, then the second at $200 and the third one at $185.

XRP/USD Daily Chart

XRP/USD is currently trading at $0.1980. The coin managed to stay above 100-day SMA rspite the retreat from the recent recovery high above $0.2000. We will need to see a sustainable move above $0.2020 (July 19 recovery high) for the bullish to gain traction and take the price outside the long-term bearish channel. The 100-day SMA at $0.1966 serves as an initial support level that may slow down the bears and initiate the recovery towards psychological $0.2000 followed by the above-mentioned $0.2020. Once it is out of the way, the upside is likely to gain traction with the next focus on 200-day SMA on approach t0 $0.2100.

Above the current price, the first resistance level is at $0.2000, then the second at $0.2020 and the third one at $0.21.

That’s the principle behind the cryptocurrency project Ampleforth’s AMPL tokens, which are suddenly getting a fresh look from traders after a tenfold increase in their total supply over the past three weeks to 340 million.

Though the project’s market capitalization of $398 million is still tiny in relative terms, at just 0.23% of bitcoin’s $170 billion, some analysts say AMPL could see further uptake as a new form of liquidity in the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi.

In fact, demand for the token has been so hot that its current price of about $2.77 is nearly three times the project’s own target of $1.009. The impetus appears to have been Ampleforth’s launch last month of Geyser, a new rewards program that encourages the token’s use on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange.

The token “has been on an absolute tear,” Paul Burlage, an analyst with the cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, wrote in a July 9 report.

Two years ago, a San Francisco-based engineer and robotics researcher named Evan Kuo, alongside co-founder Brandon Iles and their team, decided to tackle a problem in digital-asset markets: tight correlations between bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies that make the market vulnerable to widespread sell-offs – as traders scramble for cash or cash-like instruments such as dollar-backed stablecoins.

The dynamic poses risks for DeFi, where the cryptocurrencies are often pledged as collateral on semi-autonomous lending and borrowing platforms. “The high correlations prevalent in today’s cryptocurrencies create systemic risk,” Kuo told First Mover in a Telegram chat.

So in December 2018, the team launched Ampleforth protocol with $3 million in funding from the likes of Brian Armstrong, CEO of the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase; Pantera Capital, a cryptocurrency investment fund; and True Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm.

The project aims to address the systemic risk by designing a token to be mostly uncorrelated with other cryptocurrencies, and also isolated from swings in traditional financial markets.

The secret to the design is a combination of intentional inflation and anti-dilution: When prices for the AMPL token rise above a target, more units are issued directly to holders’ wallets in proportion to their holdings. Theoretically, the extra supply creates inflation that should help to push prices back down, but traders are made whole because they suddenly have more of the tokens.

The mechanism is supposed to limit price volatility, potentially making AMPL tokens more desirable as a stable form of collateral for DeFi systems.

“AMPL’s differentiated movement pattern reduces the risk of autoliquidation in the DeFi space,” Kuo said.

According to the project’s website, traders can use the tokens to diversify investment portfolios, park as collateral in DeFi or even hold as a “better bitcoin.”

How AMPL works

Ampleforth has set a target price for AMPL based on the value of the U.S. dollar in 2019. And that target price is adjusted continuously based on the consumer price index, which offers a rough way of gauging monthly decreases in the dollar’s purchasing power.

But during times of heavy demand for the tokens, the market price can diverge from the target price. And that appears to be happening now, as traders deploy the AMPL tokens in fast-growing DeFi platforms.

On June 23, AMPL “traded above its price threshold of $1.06 and never looked back,” according to Delphi Digital’s Burlage.

For example, on July 19, the token was trading at $2.95, nearly three times the target price. Under the rules of the protocol, the supply automatically increased by 16% at the end of the 24-hour period, according to Ampleforth’s dashboard.

The extra supply represents inflation that should theoretically reduce the value of each AMPL token. But since the extra supply goes into holders’ wallets, the overall value of their holdings should theoretically stay the same. Inflation, coupled with anti-dilution, as designed.

Burlage wrote that there are strong incentives built into the system encouraging traders to hold onto their AMPL tokens. But the market could turn, since it’s prone to a “cyclical boom and bust cycle.”

“With the price running up, it is now a game of chicken between large holders to see who sells first and time the top,” Burlage wrote.

It might be the future of money, but as is often the case in cryptocurrency markets, speculation and experimentation are the right-now.

BTC: Price: $9,361 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,445 | 24-Hr Low: $9,304

Trend: Bitcoin is struggling to extend Tuesday’s 2.5% price gain.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,360, representing a 0.4% decline on the day.

The immediate bias remains neutral as the cryptocurrency remains trapped in tight range, as represented by Bollinger volatility bands, currently located at $9,424 and $9,037.

A move above the upper band would imply range breakout and could power the cryptocurrency higher to resistance at $9,800 (June 22 high) and possibly to the psychological hurdle of $10,000. Alternatively, a range breakdown would expose the 200-day moving average at $8,560.

A range breakdown may be seen if the global equities suffer sharp losses on the escalating China-U.S. tensions and the U.S. Congress’ inability to reach consensus on an additional coronavirus relief package. The cryptocurrency has recently developed a relatively strong correlation with the equity markets.

At press time, futures tied to the S&P 500 and major European indices are reporting moderate losses. Risk sentiment weakened early Wednesday after Washington ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, marking an unprecedented escalation of tensions with the Asian nation.

The cloud-based investing platform operates with a single web browser-like interface similar to an adviser workstation or portfolio management platform. Blockchange gives an adviser discretionary investment management over digital assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, among others, purchased through a qualified custodian and exchange.

There are two ways that advisers can participate in the platform, which is called BITRIA. The first is by onboarding their client accounts directly into the platform as well as the custodian and adopting a model-based approach — portfolio changes are made to all clients at once — or on a client-by-client basis, according to company CEO Dan Eyre.

Alternatively, an adviser can use the platform by a separately managed account structure. “Using this structure offers a variety of benefits versus a fund, such as deeper customization and flexibility, superior tax benefits, and ownership of the underlying assets — which is particularly critical in the digital asset ecosystem,” Eyre said.

To date, Blockchange is in pilot phase with six asset managers, Eyre said. The platform is getting the most attention from firms with between $200 million and $1 billion in client assets under management. “They see it as an opportunity to differentiate their offering versus much larger competitors,” he said.

Moving forward, the fintech’s clientele will likely consist of RIAs managing between $250 million and $10 billion in client assets, he said. Although larger firms are not necessarily out of the question, Eyre said, they just tend to be less agile in regards to adopting new asset classes.

Still, digital assets might begin to ramp up further as a result of pandemic-driven economic uncertainties that have advisers eyeing other asset classes to diversify their clients’ portfolios.

“If we were having this conversation eight months ago, we would be hearing that it’s way too early for digital assets and no one is looking for a digital TAMP,” Eyre said. “When COVID-19 struck, it changed the dynamic as RIAs’ fiduciary standard is compelling them to look at other assets that can mitigate risk for clients.”",2020-07-22 16:10:37+00:00
