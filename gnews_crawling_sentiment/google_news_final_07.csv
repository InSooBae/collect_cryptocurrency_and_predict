Bitcoin prices rose for a third straight day to its highest price in a month, reaching $9,686 Thursday. George Clayton, managing partner of New York-based Cryptanalysis Capital, expects it to go much higher. “We are bullish and higher prices are better for us, but the rise is really no big deal,” he said.

Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, pointed out The Fear and Greed index added 5 points at once and is in the “greed” zone. “Bitcoin has risen above the psychologically important $9,500 mark. This indicates a positive sentiment from investors,” Kogan told CoinDesk.

A short squeeze in the cryptocurrency derivatives market may have helped to accelerate the price rise. Over the past week, some $61 million of short positions were liquidated, outweighing the $18 million of long liquidations on derivatives exchange BitMEX. As the short sellers got squeezed, bitcoin moved to $9,400 Tuesday, and then over $9,500 on Thursday. “Big levels are being tackled,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.

Adi Yona of algorithm trading firm Efficient Frontier noted payments companies like PayPal jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon as more bullish sentiment. “Bitcoin has jumped in its last move. Paypal’s 325 million users could buy and sell bitcoins. This could have a major impact on volume and pricing as the crypto markets open up to new populations.”

BitBull’s Kogan also noted the performance of gold Thursday. Gold is nearing an all-time high, up 0.57% Thursday, at $1,882 per ounce. “Both bitcoin and gold almost completely won back their losses after the March dip in price,” he said.

Total value in DeFi over $3 billion

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up, trading around $273 and climbing 11% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT). Jack Tan, CEO of Taiwan-based Kronos Research, expects $300 ether soon. “It’s a continued bullish trend in my view, I would take profits around low-mid $300s.”

The total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) surpassed the $3 billion mark July 21, according to information from aggregator DeFi Pulse. The total value, at $3.37 billion Thursday, has quintupled since the start of 2020.

Stablecoin project Maker leads DeFi projects with $718 million in value locked. Lenders Aave and Compound follow with $560 million and $547 million, respectively. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Synthetix, with $483 million locked, and Curve, with $342 million locked, round out the top five. Of the top 35 projects on DeFi Pulse, only Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, with $9.4 million in total value locked, is not built on the Ethereum platform.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has clarified that national banks and federal savings associations can provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers. The OCC sees banks providing crypto custody services as “a modern form of traditional bank activities related to custody services.”

Banks Authorized to Offer Crypto Custody Services

The OCC announced Wednesday that it has published “a letter clarifying national banks’ and federal savings associations’ authority to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers.” An independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the OCC charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks — altogether there are currently 1,175 entities.

The announcement details: “National and state banks and thrifts have long provided safekeeping and custody services, including both physical objects and electronic assets. The OCC has specifically recognized the importance of digital assets and the authority for banks to provide safekeeping for such assets since 1998.” The letter reads:

The OCC concludes that providing cryptocurrency custody services, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency, is a modern form of traditional bank activities related to custody services. Crypto custody services may extend beyond passively holding ‘keys.’

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian P. Brooks emphasized: “This opinion clarifies that banks can continue satisfying their customers’ needs for safeguarding their most valuable assets, which today for tens of millions of Americans includes cryptocurrency.” Brooks took office in June. Prior to joining the OCC, he served as the chief legal officer for crypto exchange Coinbase. Believing that “There is huge and great promise in blockchain and crypto,” Brooks aims to solve banks’ problems with decentralization, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

The letter explains that this clarification “also reaffirms the OCC’s position that national banks may provide permissible banking services to any lawful business they choose, including cryptocurrency businesses, so long as they effectively manage the risks and comply with applicable law.”

The crypto community welcomes the OCC’s decision, viewing it as a highly bullish move. “The OCC letter is a positive development for the entire crypto industry,” Nathan McCauley, CEO of crypto custodian service provider Anchorage, was quoted by Forbes as saying. “A lack of regulatory clarity has been a big roadblock to more institutional activity in crypto, and major pronouncements like this help move the needle.” Nonetheless, he added that “Digital asset custody presents more than regulatory challenges.” Gabor Gurbacs, director of Digital Assets Strategy at Vaneck and MVIS, commented on Twitter:

That’s a great step forward toward better institutional support for bitcoin.

The overnight increase in BTC coincides with an unexpected decision from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

On July 22, the OCC said banks in the U.S. are allowed to hold cryptocurrencies. It essentially gave the green light to bank-operated crypto custodial services.

Within a day of the announcement, the cryptocurrency market surged. In tandem with BTC, Ether (ETH) also saw a substantial rally, as the price rose by 12%.

Is Bitcoin price reacting to the OCC decision?

In a formal statement, OCC Acting Comptroller, Brian Brooks said banks could serve “tens of millions of Americans” by supporting cryptocurrency custody.

Brooks said:

“From safe-deposit boxes to virtual vaults, we must ensure banks can meet the financial services needs of their customers today. This opinion clarifies that banks can continue satisfying their customers’ needs for safeguarding their most valuable assets, which today for tens of millions of Americans includes cryptocurrency.”

Effectively, this has opened the floodgates for banks to enter the cryptocurrency market and provide their clients with tools to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Throughout 2020, a consistent increase in institutional inflows into Bitcoin has continued to push the cryptocurrency market upwards.

In the second quarter of this year, Grayscale said it processed $905.8 million in inflow to its cryptocurrency products. The firm, which operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, recorded $1.4 billion in total inflow over Q1-Q2.

Bank-run crypto custodial solutions could be an alternative to existing regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Investors may be interpreting this new development as bullish as it means more accredited and institutional investors could potentially invest in the cryptocurrency market in the long-term.

Peter Van Valkenburgh, the research director at non-profit organization CoinCenter, said:

“Accepting that centralized entities for cryptocurrency safekeeping and storage are unavoidable and essential, then it is excellent news that, thanks to the OCC’s new policies, there will be even more competition for providing those services. National banks entering the game expands that competition and may also allow more traditional institutional investors to deal in cryptocurrencies.”

It is possible that the unexpected announcement of the OCC fueled an abrupt increase in demand for top cryptocurrencies.

Industry executives react positively, but with some skepticism

The overall response to the statement of the OCC was positive. Industry executives generally said that it could result in more inflows into the cryptocurrency market in the medium-term.

But, Compound Labs lawyer Jake Chervinsky emphasized that the OCC is one of many regulators in the U.S. It is also unclear whether Brooks will remain as the Acting Comptroller for a long period.

Since banks move based on market demand, Chervinsky suggested that it does not guarantee an upsurge in banks supporting crypto custody. He said:

“Banks are ultimately businesses like any other, so they'll respond to customer demand. But OCC is only one of many relevant regulators, Brian Brooks may not be in charge there for much longer, and banks are psychotically risk-averse / compliance-focused.”

As such, it remains to be seen whether investors are merely using the news as a narrative to push up the market.",,https://decrypt.co/36527/big-banks-hold-bitcoin-crypto-custodians-worry,"In brief The OCC has clarified that banks can be crypto custodians.

This means that JPMorgan can look after your Bitcoin.

But custody providers aren't worried that banks are going to come after their business any time soon.

The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency yesterday clarified that national banks and federal savings associations can act as crypto custodians. This means that institutions like JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are allowed to keep custody over the private keys to their customers’ cryptocurrency wallets.

“A national bank may provide these cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers, including by holding the unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency,” so long as they manage the risks, wrote the OCC in an interpretive letter, published yesterday.

So, the big banks can now hold your Bitcoin the way they hold your dollars, which could, theoretically, make it easier for traditional investors to buy and store BTC.

Though financial institutions can become crypto custodians, that doesn’t mean they will dominate the market any time soon. Established crypto custodians, such as Gemini and Coinbase, are highly specialized and high-tech organizations; they offer niche services that have already been vetted by regulators.

Gemini said in a statement that the OCC’s announcement “validates” the company’s approach to regulation. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage, another crypto custodian that provides custody service to several banks, said that yesterday’s news addresses “a lack of regulatory clarity,” which he describes as a “big roadblock to more institutional activity in crypto.”

Will banks replace crypto custodians?

So, will the big banks take over the market? Not any time soon, Alex Mascioli, who heads institutional services for Bequant, a digital assets prime broker, told Decrypt. Mascioli said that although banks will “eventually” offer crypto custody services, “this changes nothing in the short-term” for established crypto custodians, “except perhaps providing a catalyst for more sophisticated investors to take a more serious look at the space.”

Institutional investors, said Mascioli, “are more likely to trust an established crypto-native firm with institutional-grade offerings rather than a traditional firm that has very little experience with these assets, or with a CEO that has publicly denounced them in the past.” (Among offenders are JP Morgan’s Jaime Dimon, who, despite his bank’s crypto-friendly outlook, has referred to Bitcoin over the years as a “fraud” and a “scam.”)

Itay Malinger, CEO of Curv, a crypto custodian for institutional investors, told Decrypt that while he anticipates that “many banks will soon enter the space,” they will have some catching up to do. But it’ll be worth it, he said: “Real growth in the space occurs when the traditional financial institutions enter the arena.”

A banker speaks

Ed Boyle, CEO of the upcoming crypto-friendly challenger bank Medici Bank, told Decrypt that his bank is “not seeking to become a crypto custodian in the short-term.”

Crypto custodial services, said Boyle, are irrelevant to banks, which make money from lending the money deposited by customers. Banks would only be interested in becoming custodians, he said, “if they were motivated to be an exchange or a lender of crypto.”

“I believe that being a crypto custodian is a stepping stone to more value added activities like lending,” he said. Both Gemini and Coinbase, for instance, operate exchanges.

In other words, for banks to become crypto custodians, it’s going to have to be worth their while. Will banks start lending out crypto?",2020-07-23 18:51:08,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-race-heats-up-bitcoins-dominance-ratio-drops-to-lowest-level-in-12-months/,"Crypto Race Heats Up: Bitcoin's Dominance Ratio Drops to Lowest Level in 12 Months

The largest digital asset by market capitalization, bitcoin has lost a significant share of market dominance during the last few weeks. Bitcoin’s dominance ratio dropped to 61.5% on Thursday, after hovering around 66% for months on end. The last time the crypto asset’s dominance level was around the 61% range was over 12 months ago on June 30, 2019.

Bitcoin has the largest market valuation out of all the digital assets in existence. BTC’s market cap today is around $175 billion out of the grand total of $284 billion that represents the overall worth of all 5,700+ crypto assets.

When people refer to the “Bitcoin Dominance Index” (BDI), they are referring to BTC’s market cap compared to the aggregate market cap of all the other coins. Interestingly, BTC’s dominance level stayed consistently above the 77% ratio from 2009 up until March 2017. Most of the time during those six years, BTC’s dominance ratio was between 80-90% on average.

Things certainly changed in 2017, and even though BTC touched an all-time high of $19,600 per coin, dominance continued to drop like a rock. In June 2017, BTC’s market dominance was only 37%, but it regained some of the uptrend capitalization throughout the latter half of 2017 and into 2018.

Bitcoin’s dominance index fell to an all-time low of 32% on January 14, 2018. However, BTC has been able to once again regain some of the capitalization losses, in comparison to the rest of the crypto economy. During the last year, BTC has steadily kept the BDI above the 65% range, but on February 23, 2020, it dropped to 62% for a very short period of time.

Now BTC is below that range again and cryptocurrency proponents are discussing the subject with great fervor. One Redditor from r/cryptocurrency commented on a forum post about the situation and said “Altseason imminent.” The term ‘altseason’ or ‘altcoin season’ is a period of time when alternative digital assets besides bitcoin (BTC), see their market caps increase significantly by undermining BTC’s overall BDI metric.

Of course, altcoin season happened in the summer of 2017 when BTC’s dominance index crashed down to the 37% zone. Just as many speculators assume that BTC prices will grow bullish once again, many also expect an altcoin season to precede the ostensible pending bull run.

Today on July 23, 2020, BTC’s dominance index level at 61.5% indicates that a few high profile digital coins have been gathering bigger gains. The biggest crypto asset market valuation that’s chomping away at BTC’s dominance is Ethereum, as it captures close to 10% of the overall $285 billion crypto coin market cap.

In the past, XRP was a strong contender against BTC’s market dominance, but this isn’t the case so much anymore. XRP does have a touch over 3% of the entire crypto-coin valuation, but tether (USDT) is larger today. The stablecoin tether has managed to become the third-largest market valuation and its ecosystem has been nipping at bitcoin’s heels as of late.

Of course, BTC maximalists have not appreciated the fact that Ethereum’s defi boom is bringing fierce competition to the first cryptocurrency’s dominance levels. Blockstream representative Grubles (@notgrubles) criticized the Ethereum project after ETH saw significant gains on Wednesday.

“So the Ethereum people simultaneously marketed Ethereum as the world computer /and/ knew it wouldn’t scale while they marketed it as such. Am I taking crazy pills or is that just straight-up fraud?” Grubles tweeted.

In response, the popular Twitter account @degenspartan responded to Gruble’s take on Ethereum.

“We need higher ETH/BTC ratio for more takes like this,” Degen Spartan said poking fun at Gruble’s tweet. Blockchair founder Nikita Zhavoronkov also rubbed it in on July 23 and tweeted:

Sorry Bitcoin maxis, but the flippening is in full force now.

Meanwhile, as BTC is up 1.6% today, ETH has spiked over 8% during the last 24-hours. BTC is up a touch over 4% during the last week, while ETH has gained 13% in seven days. 90-day stats show that ETH is wiping the floor with bitcoin’s (BTC) three-month gains, as ETH is up over 41% compared to BTC’s 26% (90-day).

Against the U.S. dollar, BTC is still down 2% for the last 12 months of trading prices, but ETH has gained 22% in the last year. Moreover, there’s a number of other altcoins nipping away at BTC’s dominance levels as well, as coins like ADA, LINK, and CRO have seen significant gains between 119-238% during the last 12 months.

Gold is on the brink of an all-time high, up 0.80% Friday, at $1,901 per ounce. Sweden-based over-the-counter bitcoin trader Henrik Kugelberg sees gold nearing its all-time high as a positive for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin will pass $20,000 in a surge. I suspect a new normal discounted bitcoin price will be around $15,000 in 2021, like it has been around $9,000 in 2020.”

Bullish bitcoin traders love to talk about gold, since they see similarities between the yellow metal and the cryptocurrency. “I think we are just a couple weeks or months out from a strong continuation on bitcoin as gold reaches $1,900 today,” said William Purdy, a New York-based equity options and crypto trader.

Indeed, gold’s jump this week occurred as bitcoin eked gains and the S&P 500 U.S. stock index performance was back to being flat for 2020.

Kugelberg is pessimistic on stocks for the balance of 2020. “I believe there will be at least a 30% drop in stocks on average at the latest in Q4. So where to go? To real assets with lasting value,” said Kugelberg. He mentioned gold, bitcoin and property as “real assets”.

“Bitcoin bulls have momentum on their side for now,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an Italy-based over-the-counter bitcoin trader. “The crypto market is likely to be heading towards a bullish continuation from here.”

Within crypto, ether is doing even better than bitcoin this week. ETH/BTC, that is, ether priced in bitcoin, has seen a jump in the past few days.

Ether prices have increased almost 12% against bitcoin, said Aaron Suduiko, head of research for cryptocurrency liquidity provider SFOX. “It will be interesting to see whether any trends develop in the event that more DeFi projects continue to grow.”

Uniswap crosses $100 million in liquidity

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Friday trading around $283 and climbing 3.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

“The recent gains in ether are due to the on-going thematic chatter on social media around new DeFi projects that have been showing considerable strength,” said Purdy, the equity options and crypto trader. Indeed, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), for trading various DeFi project tokens, surpassed $100 million in liquidity Friday.

Instead of order books, Uniswap uses liquidity pools that investors can “stake” cryptocurrency into and profit or “yield” from trading fees on the DEX. This liquidity is what enables Uniswap traders to quickly exchange between ether and various Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, with total daily volume reaching $71 million per day, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.

Cryptocurrency related scams have taken a total of $381 million from victims so far this year. This figure makes crypto scams the largest category of cryptocurrency-related crimes so far in 2020.

Chainalysis data still shows current figures are well below those seen in 2019. In 2019, scams accounted for 74% of crypto-related crimes.

The current 2020 drop in value of crypto scams is attributed to the absence of a major scam like the Plustoken Ponzi scheme.

Crucially, Chainaylsis’ data also shows that the share of cryptocurrency-related crimes to overall crypto activity remains well below 1%. Still, the blockchain analytics firm cautions that current figures are only preliminary. The final figure might grow as more previously unreported scams are uncovered.

Meanwhile, in its comments on the 15 July Twitter hack, Chainalysis notes that the “scam perpetrated by the hackers isn’t new either.”

The impersonation of a notable person or company on social media and the imploring of users to send them cryptocurrency in return for more later has been going on for years.

Pointing to data compiled by Cryptoscamdb—an open-source database—Chainalysis shows that this type of scam (or trust trading as it is called) accounts for about 71% of all crypto scams reported since June 2018.

Chainalysis also reveals that Twitter hackers “took in 13.14 BTC worth approximately $120,000 over the course of the afternoon.”

The analytics firm has identified three main addresses used by scammers but it notes “most of the stolen funds were (subsequently) consolidated in the bitcoin wallet address” which it terms the scam cash-out address.

Of the approximately 21 BTC deposited to the scam cash-out address over the lifetime of that wallet, “as of 4:30 PM ET July 22, 2020, roughly 9 BTC is sitting in 23 wallets, 8 BTC has been sent to mixing services like Wasabi Wallet, and 4 BTC has been sent to other entities.”

Nevertheless, Chainalysis refuses to divulge more details fearing this might jeopardize ongoing investigations.

Meanwhile, a whale alert post on Twitter 23 July reports “a payment of 1.8526 BTC (17589 USD) was made to a confirmed fake giveaway scam!”

In the same blog post, Chainalysis also asserts the importance of blockchain analysis. It argues that the visibility into fund movement enabled by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin makes them a safer, more transparent asset than cash and other traditional forms of value transfer.

Central banks have been printing money on a scale like never before, which makes the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. Over $2 trillion dollars were printed to stabilize the markets and increase liquidity.

Back in 2008, Bitcoin (BTC) was created in reaction to these quantitative easing programs as an alternative to fiat currencies and the traditional financial systems. Where governments can print money at will, a numerus clausus asset class is attractive as an inflationary hedge.

In 2008, the financial crisis began with disruption to the United States real estate and financial markets, only spreading to the financial and real economy in the rest of the world after a certain time delay. The COVID-19 outbreak is different in that it exerts a more radical and abrupt effect — first an economic upheaval by putting the real economy out of action immediately and completely, and then culminating in a financial crisis.

Central banks globally have printed trillions in the first wave of COVID-19, with many more expected to come. Airbags have been deployed, whether it be direct deposits for the survival of individuals or new loans for the survival of businesses. A large amount of liquidity has been injected into monetary systems, with a sizable portion of it finding its way to the equity markets. The same will eventually happen to the crypto markets, but that hasn’t happened yet.

The birth of guaranteed income is a result of central banks fighting the crisis with financial instruments — Bitcoin played no part in it. In fact, a hard money system, like what gold was during the great depression, can be detrimental during times of acute crisis. The market crash of 1929 became the economic depression of the 1930’s by way of a monetary transmission — gold was simply held as a store of value.

Crypto market participants should be familiar with the supply-and-demand dynamics causing the current equity markets rally. After all, there are neither economic asset-backing nor earnings models in the crypto realm — prices are driven purely by market supply and demand. With the influx of new money fueling demand in the equity markets, what we are witnessing is the inflation of financial assets, and a floating of the haves, combined with deflation of economic assets, and a needed rescue of the have-nots.

Modern monetary tools are flexible, swift, broad and powerful — it is logical that they are being deployed. The arguments we often hear from the Twitter peanut gallery that “Bitcoin solves this” are just misguided if not financially illiterate. In an age of abundance, paradoxically, Bitcoin simply does not and cannot deploy emergency funds to avoid starvation and civil unrest. To argue in a time of public suffering for hard money almost appears to be one of ignorant if not malignant sociopathy. Forget that Bitcoin isn’t money, much less hard money. Instead of tilting at central bank windmills, crypto would do well to focus on what it does well — as a speculative store of value.

Bitcoin’s resilience, in this regard, will become more evident when the COVID-19 dust settles. Cryptocurrencies have held their own on the aspect of wealth preservation and growth, but their benefits have traditionally been limited to the fortunate few who already have exposure. That is, however, changing.

With all the liquidity entering the markets and the finite number of Bitcoin, market participants have been increasingly bullish on the crypto — it’s just market number logic. We will likely witness a surge in money flows into crypto markets, similar to what we saw in the equity markets. This is narrowly financial — cryptos did well amid a financial panic.

On a higher level, open-source blockchains are possibly philosophical constructs to the future of data, personal data, voting data and medical data. Today, we focus on investments and banking. Stablecoins offer downside protection, others offer very volatile growth, and some others are hybrids of the two.

What can crypto do? It can serve as a transnational store of value, offering both downside protection and upside potential, and it does that well. Does it solve the economic and financial crisis unfolding? No. Crypto is an epiphenomenon on the world monetary stage. It may one day take center stage if it sheds its illusions and keeps executing.

To ascertain whether or not market participants are positioned in a bullish or bearish manner, analysts usually rely on technical analysis and derivatives markets, although those usually mix retail flow.

More recently some exchanges created internal metrics exclusively measuring top traders positions. Looking at exchange-provided data highlighting traders’ long-to-short positioning, one can see that the indicator currently shows a 30-day high on the long/short positions at Binance.

Despite launching its futures platform only ten months ago, Binance is a top-5 contender with $430 million BTC open interest. A similar long/short ratio has been observed at Huobi futures.

Bitcoin futures and options markets corroborate such a favourable thesis by displaying a positive contango and a negative skew.

By combining three indicators (top traders positions, options skew, and futures contango) there is indisputable evidence that professional traders are bullish in the short-term.

Top traders long-to-short ratio

The Binance net long/short notional exposure of its top BTC/USDT futures top traders typically favors longs but the indicator now stands at its highest level.

As per the above chart, top accounts net exposure is currently 12% larger than shorts. This is a 6% increase from three days ago.

Huobi, also a top-5 BTC futures exchange, depicts a similar trend and currently shows $640 million open interest. What is notable is that Huobi’s indicator shows a more significant uptick as net shorts previously dominated ratio.

Huobi’s top traders long-to-short ratio had been below 1.00 until July 21, favoring net shorts. On that day the tide changed and currently the ratio stands at 1.14 which is the highest it's been in 30 days.

Bitcoin futures contango has held steady

The premium for Bitcoin futures 1-month contracts, known as basis, has sustained a healthy positive level.

Bitcoin futures 1-month basis. Source: Skew

1-month BTC futures at OKEx and Kraken have been holding a 7% or more premium to current spot level, indicating contango. This indicator improved from a neutral 2% rate earlier this month.

Bitcoin options have also flipped bullish

Skew is a useful metric for gauging professional traders’ sentiment through options pricing. By comparing the implied volatility of put and call options, one can assert whether it is more costly to buy call (bullish) or put (bearish) options.

The chart above shows that the 1-month options 25% delta skew has just flipped to the negative side. A negative indicator means implied volatility for calls is more significant than puts, signaling a higher insurance cost for a favorable price move.

Although this is not necessarily a bullish indicator by itself (as other factors might influence options pricing), this trend change is unarguably an indicator of professional traders' positive sentiment.

All three indicators are bullishly aligned

Currently the top traders net positions, options skew, and futures contango signify short-term bullish sentiment from professional traders.

Adding to this, as all the indicators turned bullish, Bitcoin price showed strength by breaking the $9,400 resistance on July 22.

Large and savvy traders seem to be betting that the $10,000 level could be tested earlier than expected. With altcoins rallying, there's even more chance of continued uptrend.

The years-long upgrade – intended to radically transform the world’s largest smart-contract platform – is inching closer to deployment. The Ethereum Foundation recently announced “Medalla,” a final testnet before the mainnet launch of the Eth 2.0 beacon chain.

As of July 10, some developers, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, estimate the oft-delayed Eth 2.0 will launch by the end of this year.

To mark the fifth anniversary of the network’s launch, CoinDesk is producing Ethereum at Five – a cross-platform series featuring special coverage, a limited-run newsletter and live-streamed discussions on Twitter. New issues and sessions launch daily from July 27-31. The pop-up experience precedes another event in September focused on Eth 2.0.

When phase zero of Eth 2.0 does ship, little about Ethereum will change in the near term for users and dapp developers. This is because unlike all other system-wide upgrades in Ethereum history, the Eth 2.0 overhaul will primarily be happening on a different blockchain.

The first phase of development for Eth 2.0 is centered around the creation of a separate proof-of-stake blockchain network called the beacon chain. On this new network, ETH holders with a minimum of 32 ETH can earn rewards in the form of annualized interest on their wealth. To earn these rewards, ETH holders must have the appropriate hardware and software connecting to the beacon chain and a strong understanding of how the technology works.

In a new 22-page report from CoinDesk Research, the technology behind Eth 2.0 is explained as well as the phases of development it will undergo in the years after its launch.

Ethereum as we know it today will eventually be folded into the Eth 2.0 upgrade in its entirety. The report features commentary from Ethereum developers about what benefits – but also risks – this may bring.

The report also discusses the potential market impact of Eth 2.0, including the ramifications of the new system’s economic design on coin supply, velocity and value.

Why it matters

The culmination of over five years of research and development, Ethereum 2.0 is a highly ambitious upgrade.

Never before has the cryptocurrency industry seen a blockchain of the same size and value as Ethereum attempt to transition all users, as well as assets, to an entirely new decentralized network while keeping all operations on the old network active and running.",2020-07-24 17:05:50+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/carlos-ghosns-600k-crypto-escape-fee-paid-via-coinbase,"The son of former Renault and Nissan head and fugitive Carlos Ghosn used Coinbase to pay two men $600,000 in bitcoin to get his father out of Japan in December.",2020-07-24 11:44:44+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/now-that-us-banks-can-offer-crypto-custody-services-will-they/,"On July 22nd, an independent bureau of the United States Treasury, known as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), issued a public letter clarifying that national banks and federal savings associations are legally permitted to have custody of cryptocurrency assets.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

In other words, US banks have the right to provide storage services for cryptocurrencies.

Fortune reported that the OCC letter, which was addressed to an unnamed US financial institution, “also opens the door for banks to offer more exotic services”, including staking and cryptocurrency lending.

Providing cryptocurrency services is a “modern form of these traditional bank activities.”

Regarding custody, the letter said that “national banks have long provided safekeeping and custody services for a wide variety of customer assets, including both physical objects and electronic assets.”

“[…] The OCC concludes…that providing cryptocurrency custody services, including holding the unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency, is a modern form of these traditional bank activities.”

The letter also notes that banks could potentially provide services that amount to “more secure storage services compared to existing options,” and that consumers and investment advisors may have a desired to entrust regulated custodians with their assets, rather than an unregulated entity.

The letter was authored by Brian Brooks, a former Coinbase executive who is the current head of the OCC. CoinDesk reported that since Brooks joined the regulatory earlier this summer, he “has already proposed a number of reforms that would benefit crypto companies.”

These reforms include a national payments charter that would let cryptocurrency startups that wish to provide payment services bypass the current patchwork of state-by-state processes for acquiring money transmission licenses.

Letter does not represent policy change, but rather clarification of existing policy

While the announcement does not represent a policy change–rather, a clarification of an existing policy– the news could be quite significant for the cryptocurrency industry.

Previously, a lack of legal clarity around whether or not banks in the United States had the right to hold cryptocurrencies for their customers led banks to avoid Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Fortune reported that this resulted in a de facto ban on banks providing many crypto-related services to their customers.

Now, however, big banks have essentially been given the ‘go-ahead’ to begin offering cryptocurrency custody and other crypto-related services to their users. The question is: will they?

“I’m looking forward to getting my ass kissed by all the banks now.”

For Barry Silbert, the founder and chief executive of crypto industry investment firm Digital Currency Group, the answer is likely ‘yes.’

“I’m looking forward to getting my ass kissed by all the banks now,” he wrote on Twitter following the letter’s publication.

I'm looking forward to getting my ass kissed by all the banks now — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) July 22, 2020

“Oh what a change from when we first met??!!,” wrote Caitlin Long, founder and chief executive of crypto-friendly bank Avanti Bank and Trust, in reply. “That was 2014, I think…my how the tables have turned.”

After all, the cryptocurrency industry’s market cap currently sits at roughly $285 billion–a nice chunk of change that US banks could potentially be interested in dipping their fingers into.

Some major banks in the United States have already started to provide cryptocurrency-related services to their clientele: JPMorgan Chase, for example, began providing support to Gemini and Coinbase earlier this year.

Still, however, banks in the U.S. maintained a cautionary approach toward serving the crypto industry; cryptocurrency exchanges and other startups seem to be generally regarded as risky for banks’ reputations, as well as a legal headache.

The distinction that banks can offer custody services, however, may be a step toward alleviating some of the banks’ concerns.

Tell us in the comments below.",2020-07-24 08:43:53+00:00,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/bitcoin-deemed-money-under-d-c-financial-services-law,"The virtual currency known as Bitcoin is a form of “money” covered under the Washington, D.C., Money Transmitters Act, a federal court said Friday.

The court declined to dismiss criminal charges against Larry Dean Harmon, the operator of an underground Bitcoin trading platform, for running an unlicensed money transmitting business under D.C. law and for laundering money under federal law.

The ruling will likely have minimal impact on how Bitcoin is treated by the market, but establishes parameters on how the District of Columbia regulates cryptocurrency in money transmission. It also brings the D.C. rule in line with how federal and state authorities treat Bitcoin for the purposes of anti-money laundering purposes.

Harmon, who allegedly portrayed his platform as a service for stripping Bitcoin of any link to illegal transactions, was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2019. He sought to dismiss the illegal-money-transmission claims, arguing that Bitcoin isn’t “money” under the MTA and that his platform wasn’t a “money transmitting business” under the U.S. Code.

Money “commonly means a medium of exchange, method of payment, or store of value,” Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “Bitcoin is these things.”

The D.C. law adopts that meaning even though it doesn’t strictly define “money,” the court said.

The district court’s ruling means that Bitcoin is treated as money only in the context of D.C.'s money transmission law, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a crypto and blockchain-focused nonprofit based in Washington.

“These cases pop up all the time because nearly every state has its own definition of money transmission” that triggers licensing requirements, Van Valkenburgh said.

Harmon’s service, located on the Darknet, was allegedly advertised as a way to mask drug, gun, or other illegal transactions from law enforcement. It was used to exchange the equivalent of around $311 million dollars between 2014 and 2017, the indictment said.

The court also denied Harmon’s motion for release of 160 Bitcoins seized by the government. There was a high likelihood that all funds involved in his platform were also involved in alleged drug trafficking conspiracy, making them subject to forfeiture, Howell’s order said.



‘Another Brick’

In this case, the District’s definition of money under its money transmitter laws was vague, but the judge chose to rely on the common use of the term “money.”

“It’s just another brick in the wall” for states to put more precision in how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are treated under their statutes, Van Valkenburgh said.

Companies transacting in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generally required to obtain money transmission licenses from states.

The Treasury Department’s financial crimes enforcement division has also deemed that money laundering using crypto tumblers and mixers—fee-based services used to mix digital assets to make them more difficult to trace back to the original holder—falls under federal money transmission laws.

The case is United States v. Harmon, D.D.C., No. 19-cr-395, 7/24/20.",,https://www.govtech.com/security/Twitter-Bitcoin-Scam-Resembles-Similar-Schemes-on-YouTube.html,"(TNS) — The Bitcoin scam that hackers deployed while breaking into the Twitter Inc. accounts of political leaders and business titans last week closely resembles similar schemes used previously on YouTube.

In the July 15 Twitter attack, hackers hijacked accounts belonging to Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden and Jeff Bezos and asked their followers to send Bitcoins to their crypto wallet with a promise to double the amount. In a matter of hours, the hackers had accrued more than $100,000.

But before compromising those accounts, the hackers targeted the Twitter accounts of popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Inc., Gemini Trust Company LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. In this case, the attackers tweeted a link to a website dubbed “CryptoForHealth,” which also promised to double donations made to a crypto wallet.

The move caught the attention of computer security researchers, who say similar scams were perpetrated in recent months on Google’s YouTube. One of the researchers, who like his colleagues requested anonymity because he isn’t authorized to speak publicly, said it isn’t yet clear who was behind the Twitter hack but said that the YouTube scams appeared coordinated.

The earlier attacks make clear that stealing user accounts to perpetrate cryptocurrency scams isn’t a problem unique to Twitter. The possibility that the incidents are connected may give investigators additional ways to identify the perpetrators, people familiar with the scams say. In online forums, several people have claimed to know the identity of the person behind the CryptoForHealth websites.

One website used as part of the apparent YouTube scams, “btc-gemini.info,” looks almost identical to the “CryptoForHealth” site. Beyond the visual similarities, the sites share technical details, such as IP addresses and website code, according to a Bloomberg review of the data.

The links between the schemes on Twitter and YouTube aren’t definitive, according to the researchers and Bloomberg’s analysis. But at the very least, it shows how easily they can be duplicated, they said.

Alex Joseph, a YouTube spokesman, said the company takes account security seriously by automatically protecting users and notifying them when suspicious activity is detected. “If a user has reason to believe their account was compromised,” he said, “they can notify us to secure the account and regain control.”

YouTube declined to address whether the alleged crypto scams on its site were related to the Twitter hack. On Tuesday, Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak filed a lawsuit in state court in California alleging that YouTube has for months allowed scammers to use his name and likeness as part of a phony Bitcoin giveaway.

In the alleged YouTube scams, a hacker typically gained control of an account and made it look like an official page of a cryptocurrency exchange or celebrity. Taking over a YouTube account with an already established following lets the hackers reach a wide audience. That was the same goal with last week’s Twitter hack, which hijacked accounts with tens of millions of followers.

After gaining control of an account, the hacker typically live streams an interview with the likes of Bill Gates and runs information about the fake cryptocurrency giveaway alongside it. The alleged scam has been used with video interviews of the Winklevoss twins (who founded popular cryptocurrency exchange Gemini), and Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the Ethereum cryptocurrency.

In June, cybersecurity blog BleepingComputer reported three YouTube accounts were hijacked to run a crypto giveaway scam, this time live streaming an interview with Musk, Tesla Inc.’s chief executive officer, next to fake information about the scam. In this instance, the perpetrator raked in more than $150,000.

The live streams tend to attract a large audience for the alleged scams before they’re detected by YouTube. In some instances, the perpetrators skip stealing an account altogether and simply purchase YouTube ads promoting the alleged scam.

The cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs Inc. filed a lawsuit in April against YouTube over the so-called “giveaway” swindle. “For every scam, giveaway, fake conspiracy that is taken down, multiple more pop up nearly immediately,” the company wrote in a blog post. “The reality is that big technology and media companies need to take responsibility and be held accountable for protecting consumers.”

In one case, a YouTube user with 282,000 subscribers was hacked and had his account edited to appear as if it was representing the “Ripple Foundation,” according to the lawsuit. The attackers then began posting videos from the hacked account promoting the cryptocurrency scam. The user, Mesa Sean, who makes videos of himself playing videogames, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

According to the lawsuit, YouTube accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers are targeted with email phishing attacks, where hackers trick the account owner into giving up their password. Ripple estimates that hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Ripple cryptocurrency have been stolen as part of the illicit operations.

The string of high-profile scams makes it harder for cryptocurrency companies to persuade consumers that their operations are secure.

”Last week’s Twitter hack is just the latest dramatic example of an ongoing and widespread problem with social media platforms – malicious scams on Twitter, YouTube, Medium, Instagram and others have proliferated for years with no real solution,” Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement.

In a motion to dismiss Ripple’s lawsuit filed on Monday, lawyers for YouTube said it’s not liable for the scams under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields platforms from potentially illegal activity by users.

This was a busy week in the world of cryptocurrencies. Here are some updates, both local and international.

Bitcoin value rises

The world's most famous virtual money has been on a bit of a tear.

Tonight (Vancouver time), one Bitcoin punctured through the $13,000 mark in Canadian currency, according to Morningstar.

Back on Monday (July 20), it fell to $12,403 for one Bitcoin. While it's not a world-beating gain, it does account for a five percent increase in a week. Not bad for something that billionaire Warren Buffett insists has no value.

Court rules in favour of Bitcoin

Bitcoin's most recent rise came after Coindesk reported that a U.S. judge had ruled that Bitcoin is a ""form of money"".

Judge Beryl Howell issued the ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a case involving Larry Dean Harmon.

He faced three counts in connection of his operation of Helix as an underground tumbler for Bitcoin on the Darknet.

Judge Howell denied Harmon's motion to dismiss two counts, as well as his motion for the release of 160 Bitcoins seized by the government. They're currently worth more than $2 million.

She also declared that Helix meets the definition of an ""unlicensed money transmitting business"".

Steve Wozniak isn't thrilled that his face has shown up in cryptocurrency scams on social media. Lexeru

Apple cofounder sues Google

Meanwhile, the Verge has reported that Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak and several other plaintiffs have named YouTube and Google as defendants in a lawsuit over phony Bitcoin promotions.

Wozniak's face appeared in videos suggesting he would give away the cryptocurrency.

The action was filed in California.

""With full knowledge of this scam, YouTube resisted taking the scam videos down, allowed them to multiply, and contributed to the scam by making them appear legitimate,"" the complaint states. ""YouTube and Google took the further step of promoting and profiting from these scams by providing paid advertising that targeted users who were most likely to be harmed.""

Other tech high flyers' faces were used in the scam, which gained global attention after Twitter was hacked on July 15 to spread the message more broadly.

Among those victimized were Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple Inc.

Wozniak alleged that YouTube has been ""unresponsive"" to his repeated efforts to stop the unauthorized use of his face and likeness.

""In stark contrast to YouTube, when faced with this attack, Twitter took swift and decisive action to protect its users, shutting down the hijacked accounts until after Twitter regained control,"" the complaint alleges.

""As a result, the massive Twitter hack resulted in only about $120,000 in losses, whereas the YouTube scam has generated many millions of dollars in stolen cryptocurrency.""

None of the allegations have been proven in court.

NetCents reaches international merchants

A Vancouver-based cryptocurrency-payment technology company says it is attracting more international merchants to use its service.

NetCents Technology Inc. says that in 2019, only 27 percent of the merchants using its service were outside the United States.

It says that this year, it's reached 67 percent.

In addition, NetCents Technology claims that the average transaction for business-to-business exchanges has reached $25,000.

On July 4, it announced that it is forming a wholly owned subsidiary in Germany to support its European business.

NetCents Technology insists that it has a ""white-label solution"", which it can provide to commercial banks interested in allowing their clients to trade in cryptocurrencies.

Last month, the company stated that it had received a US$1.4-billion institutional credit facility ""to power merchant settlements"".

The term is 15 months, according to the company, with ""auto-renewing one-year terms"" and no interest going to the credit facility. Plus, the company said there are no fees for the first three months.

Funds from coin sales are in a trust account managed by the company's legal counsel.

NetCents Technology disclosed on July 6 that as of the end of April, ""the funds are being held in trust subject to an investigation by the British Columbia Securities Commission"".

""The outcome of this investigation is unknown and the funds are to remain in trust until the investigation by the BCSC is complete.""

On July 24, NetCents Technology closed at $1.12 on the Canadian Securities Exchange, down 10.4 percent on the day.",2020-07-25 23:17:21-07:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/complex-compliances-checklist-for-crypto-atm-operators,"The very first Bitcoin (BTC) ATM came to the United States in 2014 to Austin, Texas. This historic event occurred quickly after Canada pioneered the idea in 2013, and the excitement and demand for such ATMs have soared across the globe ever since. There are currently over 8,000 BTC ATMs in more than 70 countries worldwide. In fact, the highest number of Bitcoin ATMs was recorded in the U.S. in 2020, and as of April 2020, approximately 81% of global ATMs were concentrated in North America.

Two types of Bitcoin ATMs exist, with one being more complex than the other. The more basic one simply enables users to purchase Bitcoin, whereas the more complex one provides the function of both buying and selling. These new-age machines have sky-rocketed in popularity, overtaking Bitcoin exchanges as a preference for many. The exchange of fiat for Bitcoin is now a seamless procedure, with Bitcoin ATMs offering a fast and user-friendly experience. This all sounds great — but how can ATM operators buy a machine and set it up in their desired location?

There is just one thing we haven’t mentioned until now — compliance. Bitcoin ATM operators need to ensure a comprehensive compliance framework that appeases Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations, as well as other laws on a federal and state level. Without necessary compliance measures fully in place, Bitcoin ATM operators will be forced to shut down. In short, compliance is key.

Research money transmitter requirements

It’s crucial to understand that regulation for Bitcoin ATMs varies from state to state — some states are more welcoming than others. New York has much stricter requirements than Texas, for example. These differences are abundant and are constantly updated.

For example, in some states, money transmitter requirements declare that you must acquire a money transmitter license. Any operator without a license is committing an imprisonable offense, even if it has completed every other step toward compliance. Therefore, it’s important to research the specific states in which you are operating to avoid any difficulty.

The federal regulations relating to Bitcoin ATMs are outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA. This law requires all financial institutions, including Bitcoin ATMs, to assist U.S. government agencies in both detecting and preventing money laundering. Therefore, Bitcoin ATMs must adhere to the regulations of the BSA and rules relating to AML. As mentioned above, both federal and state laws must be followed. For this reason, it is crucial that you research the law in the specific states that you operate in, too.

Register as an MSB with FinCEN

In the U.S., Bitcoin ATMs are considered Money Services Businesses and, therefore, are subject to the regulation of the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Every Bitcoin ATM operator must register as an MSB with FinCEN.

FinCEN is the U.S.’ financial intelligence unit and arbiter of federal AML laws. Registration is a simple step that involves registering via the online portal with a basic “check-the-box” process. By registering with FinCEN, you are essentially agreeing to be regulated by the entity. This also includes registering at a state level and developing an AML program in most cases, retaining transactional information and reporting any suspicious activity. For state-level regulation, you must complete a permission-based state licensing process.

Develop and implement an AML program

Once registered with FinCEN, operators must comply with the BSA as outlined above. This involves a Bitcoin ATM operator establishing and implementing an anti-money laundering compliance program — a written document that explains an operator’s overall plan to prevent its Bitcoin ATMs from facilitating money laundering activities. An AML program must address a minimum of five pillars, as outlined below:

Appointment of a designated compliance officer. This officer is responsible for day-to-day compliance with the BSA and AML programs and responsible for the risk assessment of each ATM. AML training. Ongoing training of personnel should be conducted, informing them of their specific responsibilities within the program. The training should also include an explanation of classic money laundering techniques and activities, general Bitcoin ATM risks, and other issues a compliance team may experience. Customer Due Diligence. Operators must develop risk-based procedures for conducting customer identification and due diligence. FinCEN identifies various elements of Customer Due Diligence. This pillar states that your AML program should include policies, procedures and adequate training for employees to spot beneficial owners of a legal entity customer, verify the information, comprehend the risks related to beneficial ownership, and report any related suspicious activity. Internal controls specific to your business model. Develop appropriate procedures, policies and processes specific to your business that meet all BSA requirements. Internal controls are implemented to lower the risks associated with operating Bitcoin ATMs. Multiple factors should be considered when developing internal controls, such as how to identify, report and address suspicious activity, as well as recent regulatory updates or changes. Independent review and audit. Organize independent reviews of your AML program in the form of a third-party audit/testing, occurring at least once per year.

Test your AML program, customer and transaction controls before going live

Before going live, it’s important for operators to test all AML controls. This can be done by conducting some sample transactions through the machines. It’s imperative to take this opportunity to ensure that the appropriate KYC processes and suspicious activity indicators are in place and functioning.

In addition, check that customer and transaction information is properly recorded. Any issues found during testing and any relevant changes or solutions introduced to address these problems should also be recorded.

There has been a huge stigma around Bitcoin ATMs because they are considered to be a vehicle for money laundering, with bad actors using the machines to clean cash quickly and easily. Removing this stigma and thwarting this negative reputation still remains a challenge today. However, with ATM operators following the above steps and complying with required regulation, this negative reputation can be alleviated and, hopefully, one day eradicated.

Honest, hardworking Bitcoin ATM producers and operators can play an integral role in creating this bright future, but compliance is something that cannot be ignored. Compliance is a core foundation of the Bitcoin ATM industry and must be adhered to accordingly. Compliance is not a one-time checkbox and, therefore, should be updated regularly. It is in the interest of your users to take responsibility and to be fully compliant both at a federal and state level.

The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.",,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/07/25/ripple-executive-says-quantum-computing-will-threaten-bitcoin-xrp-and-crypto-markets-heres-when/,"Ripple CTO David Schwartz says quantum computing poses a serious threat to the future of cryptocurrency.

On the Modern CTO Podcast, Schwartz says quantum computing will break the cryptographic algorithms that keep cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP – as well as the internet at large – secure.

“From the point of view of someone who is building systems based on conventional cryptography, quantum computing is a risk. We are not solving problems that need powerful computing like payments and liquidity – the work that the computers do is not that incredibly complicated, but because it relies on conventional cryptography, very fast computers present a risk to the security model that we use inside the ledger.

Algorithms like SHA-2 and ECDSA (elliptic curve cryptography) are sort of esoteric things deep in the plumbing but if they were to fail, the whole system would collapse. The system’s ability to say who owns Bitcoin or who owns XRP or whether or not a particular transaction is authorized would be compromised…

A lot of people in the blockchain space watch quantum computing very carefully and what we’re trying to do is have an assessment of how long before these algorithms are no longer reliable.”

Schwartz says he thinks developers have at least eight years until the technology, which leverages the properties of quantum physics to perform fast calculations, becomes sophisticated enough to crack cryptocurrency.

“I think we have at least eight years. I have very high confidence that it’s at least a decade before quantum computing presents a threat, but you never know when there could be a breakthrough. I’m a cautious and concerned observer, I would say.”

Schwartz says crypto coders should closely follow the latest public developments in quantum computing, but he’s also concerned about private efforts from the government.

“The other fear would be if some bad actor, some foreign government, secretly had quantum computing way ahead of what’s known to the public. Depending on your threat model, you could also say what if the NSA has quantum computing. Are you worried about the NSA breaking your payment system?

While some people might realistically be concerned – it depends on your threat model, if you’re just an average person or an average company, you’re probably not going to be a victim of this – let’s say hypothetically some bad actor had quantum computing that was powerful enough to break things, they’re probably not going to go after you unless you are a target of that type of actor. As soon as it’s clear that there’s a problem, these systems will probably be frozen until they can be fixed or improved. So, most people don’t have to worry about it.”

When you deposit money in a bank, you’re effectively making a loan, for which you get interest in return. Yield farming involves lending cryptocurrency. In return, you get interest and sometimes fees, but they’re less significant than the practice of supplementing interest with handouts of units of a new cryptocurrency. The real payoff comes if that coin appreciates rapidly. It’s as if banks were luring new depositors with the gift of a tulip -- during the Dutch tulip craze. Or a toaster, if toasters were the object of wild speculation and price swings.

2. Really?

It may sound strange, but you have to remember that unlike established currencies that have lots of money in circulation, cryptocurrencies have to perform a tricky balancing act to grow. A new currency only has value if enough people use it, so there’s an incentive to issue new units to grow a user base. But flooding the market would make the currency less valuable. (Remember, so far cryptocurrencies are sought after more for their value as a commodity whose price may rise with demand than for their usefulness in making real-world transactions, which is the main function of the dollar, euro or yuan.)

3. So how does it work?

First, do you know what a dapp is? That’s shorthand for a decentralized app. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explains the concept through this analogy: if Bitcoin is a pocket calculator, platforms with dapps are smartphones, but ones on which automated programs run without a central operating system or server. Many of them make use of the Ethereum blockchain, a digital ledger.

4. OK -- so how does it work?

The most basic approach is to lend digital coins, such as DAI or Tether, through a dapp such as Compound, which then lends the coins to borrowers who often use them for speculation. Interest rates vary with demand, but for every day’s participation in the Compound service, you get new Comp coins, as well as interest and other fees. If the Comp token appreciates -- and it’s more than doubled in value since mid-June -- your returns skyrocket as well.

5. What kind of coins are involved?

Compound, which was launched in June, is the largest such service and currently has nearly $550 million in funds, according to tracker Defi Pulse. Other major players in this game -- also called liquidity harvesting -- are Balancer, Synthetix, Curve and Ren. Synthetix pioneered the idea. Today, these services hold more than $1 billion in locked user funds, which are funds that are used in lending. Supposedly, the holders of coins like Comp can participate in the governance and improvement of these networks. But the vast majority of people using them currently are speculators, trying to earn fairy-tale-like returns.

6. What are the risks?

Theft, for one. The digital money you lend out is effectively held by software, and hackers seem to always be able to find ways to exploit vulnerabilities in code and make away with funds. Some coins that people are depositing for yield farming are also only a few years old at most, and could potentially lose their value, causing the entire system to crash. What’s more, early investors often hold large shares of reward tokens, and their moves to sell could have a huge impact on token prices. Lastly, regulators are yet to opine on whether reward tokens are or could become securities -- decisions that could have a big impact on the coins’ use and value.

7. What else could go wrong?

Story continues below advertisement

Many high-yield harvesting strategies also carry the risk of liquidation. To maximize returns, many users are adapting complex strategies. For example, some investors have been depositing DAI tokens into Compound, then borrowing DAI using initial tokens as collateral, then lending out the borrowed funds. The idea is to get a greater portion of the allocated rewards: Comp tokens. A move in the wrong direction in a token’s value could wipe out all gains and trigger liquidations.

8. What’s new about this?

People have been able to earn interest by lending their cryptocurrencies for several years through apps like BlockFi, as part of a trend of decentralized finance, or DeFi, in which middlemen like banks are replaced with the automated protocols of dapps. What’s different about new ventures like Compound are the tokens handed out to lenders and borrowers, often with implied future rights to cash flows. The idea was to give people who use these apps some “skin in the game,” by creating an incentive to participate in governing and improving the networks.

Story continues below advertisement

9. What about market manipulation?

When someone who has lent a cryptocurrency through a DeFi service like Compound then borrows it back, they’re creating artificial demand for the coins -- and thereby inflating the coins’ prices. That’s raised concerns that early adopters who have accumulated large holdings, often called whales, are manipulating price movements, a common accusation in a range of crypto markets. Small traders should beware that yield harvesting “has become a game for whales who are capturing the vast majority of rewards,” according to crypto research firm Messari.

10. Why did this get so hot right now?

A couple of reasons: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, all cryptocurrencies -- generally viewed as an uncorrelated asset in the long term -- have seen a surge of interest in light of high volatility in many traditional assets. What’s more, many of the yield-harvesting products only debuted this summer, offering highly attractive tokens as rewards and boasting of high-profile backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain.

From distribution platforms to Twitter and bitcoin, she helps break down what sex workers really need from digital tools.

Savannah Solo started her OnlyFans account in January 2020 and within a few months became one of the top earners on the platform in her category.

She’s never used bitcoin before because she relies on platforms like OnlyFans and Cash App for regular banking services. She said some performers have been temporarily deplatformed or lost access to their funds, but she’s been lucky so far. She often works a 16-hour day during these first few months of building her business.

“The market got super, super saturated during quarantine…they [OnlyFans performers] were having trouble getting any subscribers at all,” Solo said. “In my first month, in January, I only made $80.”

There’s a common misconception that sex workers are now making much more money than before the coronavirus crisis. Both Solo and fellow sex worker Honey Li agreed the brief flurry of new customers settled down in the spring and that summer has been a particularly slow season.

“Nobody is saying they are making more because of the pandemic,” Li said. “There’s a lot more new models….as for the blue collar guys that tip you, a lot of them have lost their jobs.”

Li prefers the camming site Chaturbate, instead of OnlyFans. Chaturbate charges performers nearly half of their earnings to use the site, much higher than the 20% charge from OnlyFans. But Chaturbate offers a feature that Li prefers; customers can pay in cryptocurrency and performers can cash out in bitcoin. The site still acts as a middleman, but at least Li can choose her currency.

“My customer base is mostly American, so there are instances where bitcoin is more useful for me, especially when I’m traveling,” said Li, who is based in Europe.

Bitcoin tippers

Li said some Chaturbate performers, like her, take a fraction of their earnings in bitcoin if they make extra that month. This is regardless of whether the customer paid in bitcoin, since the payment is to the platform anyway.

In addition to cashing out from the performance platform in bitcoin, Li also uses personal wallets to accept money directly from fans. Over the past year four clients tipped her in bitcoin. Yet that minority can have a large impact.

“Customers that give money directly tend to be regulars, really big fans…5% of my customers make up 90% of my income,” Li said. “There’s not a lot of people that accept bitcoin from clients directly, but I do know some findommes [financial dominatrix] who do. For a birthday gift, for example, I’ll be like cool here’s my wallet.”

Solo said she hasn’t been offered bitcoin yet. She’s still trying to manage some of the technical basics of running her own business.

“The platforms do extremely little work to help you out,” Solo said. “There is no [tech] support.”

Tech support

There are a variety of tech-savvy sex workers creating their own bitcoin-friendly platforms and teaching each other how to use various technologies.

For example, an escort booking consultant named Jo, who has been helping sex workers garner and screen clients for two years, said a few women paid her in 2019 to help them use bitcoin. The bitcoin advertising campaign lasted for a few months, on a website that only accepts bitcoin. This is generally uncommon. Jo said it was a hassle.

“I think a lot of girls in this industry want to protect their identity. However, it [bitcoin] is not the most user-friendly thing,” Jo said about the returns for time spent using bitcoin. “It was pretty dead for a while [bookings]. Business has come back, but it’s slower than usual.”

Solo also noticed the imbalance of supply and demand this summer across the sex industry. She said she usually turns to other performers for tech support and doesn’t know of other consulting options for sex workers. Performers like her generally rely on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, OnlyFans and Chaturbate to advertise their brands. Converting casual tippers into direct customers is the hardest part of the business. Until they do, performers like Solo struggle to deal with refund issues like chargebacks.

“That’s a huge issue,” Solo said about chargebacks. “People send sex workers money…then the person can call their bank, have it back-charged, and all of the money comes out of the sex worker’s account.”",2020-07-25 22:10:00+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/07/164516-new-yorks-crypto-friendly-signature-bank-reveals-8-billion-in-deposit-growth-this-quarter-with-2-5-of-them-from-blockchain-firms/,"New York-based Nasdaq: SBNY ), a cryptocurrency-friendly commercial bank with around $50 billion in total assets, has reported consistent and steady growth this quarter.

According to the bank’s recent earnings call, it has achieved around $8 billion in deposit growth. Approximately 2.5% of these deposits are associated with the institution’s blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT)-enabled payments network.

The banking of crypto-asset firms has become a significant part of Signature’s ongoing growth and development strategy, with about $1 billion coming from these customers.

Signet, which is Signature Bank’s DLT-powered payments network, accounted for around 20% of the deposit growth.

Joseph J. DePaolo, CEO at Signature Bank, said that Signet’s contribution or usefulness is measured in activity, instead of simply looking at account balances. DePaolo confirmed that the $1 billion in deposits came from digital asset customer deposits and not from crypto-asset custody. The Signet platform’s contribution to the quarterly deposits was valued at $200 million.

Available data reveals that Signature appears to be diversifying its operations, so it’s not simply facilitating deposits from digital asset clients. Signature has been helping with processing PPP (paycheck protection program) loans to crypto-asset businesses.

Firms are usually more comfortable with taking out loans with a provider they‘re currently banking with, which suggests that blockchain or crypto firms are increasingly working with the Signature team.

In June 2020, Signature, a US-based full-service commercial bank, launched and integrated the full functionality of its proprietary, blockchain-based digital payments platform, Signet, with Fireblocks, an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing and issuing digital assets.

In April 2020, Signature Bank reported a 30% decline in net income during Q1 2020 due to the Coronavirus outbreak. DePaolo had confirmed in April that it was the third consecutive quarter that the institution had secured more than $1 billion in deposits.

In April, Deposits had grown by $5.6 billion and average deposits had increased by $4.7 billion since the end of the first quarter of 2019. Loans during Q1 2020 grew 5% to $41 billion when compared to the same period last year, the bank had noted during its previous earnings call.

DePaolo stated during the call (in April 2020):

“The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where C&I [commercial and industrial] outpaced CRE [commercial real estate] growth furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating-rate assets and diversifying our credit portfolio.”

Last week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) posted a letter clarifying national banks’ and federal savings associations’ authority to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers. This clarification should buttress the ability of banks to facilitate businesses operating in the digital asset sector.",2020-07-16 00:00:00,https://www.redherring.com/top-story/a-bolivian-cryptocurrency-leader-comes-in-from-the-cold/,"For years, Mario Blacutt dared not reveal his name. He was a citizen of Bolivia, whose state pursued crypto traders with a religious zeal. Any mention of Blacutt’s true identity could land him in jail – or worse. So people knew him simply as ‘Berzeck.’

Until now. Last November Bolivia’s longtime President Evo Morales was ousted in a military coup. Under interim President Jeanine Áñez, Blacutt finally felt safe enough to announce his involvement in NULS, an open-source blockchain platform with roots in Asia. Latin America has many of the highest crypto adoption rates on earth, reflecting widespread mistrust in local currencies. And with COVID-19 set to supercharge a new global recession, Blacutt expects blockchain use to soar.

“Brazil, Colombia and Argentina are probably the countries in which blockchain development has been most developed,” admits Blacutt. “However, there is still no secure legal regulatory framework, so it did not reach mass adoption.

“Overall, companies and developers living in countries that have little confidence in their financial systems are accelerating their participation in crypto, and I believe the next global recession will certainly accelerate this process,” he adds. “Even if we are enduring a global catastrophe, at least some things will change for the better.”

Blacutt’s chance to champion decentralized currency has been a long time coming. Around 2014 he first bought Bitcoin with a friend. That year, Morales’ government became Latin America’s first to ban cryptocurrency, as it sought tighter control over the economy.

Morales, the first Bolivian leader to come from its indigenous population, was an early revelation on the continent, issuing swaths of socialist economic reforms that, among other things, halved poverty rates and boosted Bolivia’s GDP by 5%.

But Morales stifled opposition, and sought an unconstitutional fourth term in office. Cryptocurrency was a threat to his grip on the nation. So he banned it.

Tales of underground crypto kings and queens were commonplace in larger South American states like Venezuela, whose leader Nicolás Maduro clung to the ideals of deceased President Hugo Chávez. But diminutive Bolivia, a nation of 11.35 million people wedged between the Amazon Rainforest and Atacama Desert: not so much.

Still, the ban worried Blacutt, a software developer. He repurposed the name of a 1980s Atari video game called Berzerk, and bought Bitcoin by wiring cash to a bank in neighboring Peru – then onto an exchange. He always used a VPN. Bitcoin had been shrouded in anonymity since its very beginning: the identity of creator Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown.

Barcutt never faced jail time for his crypto activities. The law didn’t forbid owning Bitcoin – just paying with it. But banks made Barcutt’s life difficult, closing accounts and credit cards. “The legal reason banks used was an article in the contract where they reserve the right to close accounts for whatever reason they see fit,” he says. “They blatantly told people that it is for their ‘protection’ and on top of that, they charged a fee for this ‘protection.'”

Barcutt grew certain cryptocurrency could help people sidestep what he believed was a corrupt state, and devised a microservices solution. He presented ideas to a handful of projects but got little feedback. Then he learned about NULS, which features microservices, smart contracts, cross-chain interoperability, and instant chain-building.

“It was a perfect fit,” he says. “I developed my idea even more and presented it to the developers and founders. They recognized the potential in a few minutes.” So enamored were NULS’ leadership with Barcutt’s proposal, that they substituted it for their own NULS 2.0 rollout in September 2019.

Then, just days later, violence broke out across Bolivia. Thirty-three people died. Morales, facing heavy opposition from neighboring heads-of-state, trade unions and the military, fled to Mexico. Lawyer Áñez seized power, in a coup the White House praised. At last, Barcutt felt free enough to poke his head above the parapet.

“It was a very ugly time in my country,” he says. “As I am an optimist by nature, I choose to remember it with a small dose of melancholy…In the bear market you always have aggressive people trying to destroy things. You have to stand your ground and fight for what you believe in.”

The Morales years have set Bolivian crypto back, Barcutt admits. “Blockchain technology was not given the opportunity to evolve properly, so even acquiring crypto is difficult,” he says. “This, coupled with the fact that we are an underdeveloped country with relatively little and costly Internet access and bad general public education, makes things worse.

“Even though we currently have a transitional government, these laws are still in effect so it will take time.”

In the meantime, Barcutt will continue contributing to a tech industry that has performed surprisingly well of late. Bolivia has long been coveted for its mineral resources. But recently it has undergone a quiet digital revolution. More than 200 software development companies export around $30m. That figure doesn’t include independent workers, who could push the real figure up past $50m.

According to the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Bolivia is home to almost 11,000 developers. Almost 78% of the country is online, with over half having a Facebook account. One of America’s leading tech figures, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, is a Bolivian-American.

These are inspiring things for young Bolivian developers – not least Barcutt, delighted to do his work out in the open. Soon, he hopes, other Latin America cryptocurrency users can follow his move above ground.

“Countries like Venezuela have even more problems than Bolivia,” he says. “This will need to change because banning crypto is like trying to ban the Internet. In reality, you ban yourself from the Internet and not the other way around. The sooner the countries accept this fact, the more likely they will be able to compete in what will undoubtedly be the technological revolution of this decade.”",2020-07-25 14:00:00+00:00,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/very-much-altseasons-hard-learned-lessons-and-20-crypto-joke-7231.htm,"This week in crypto, bitcoin finally made a move, CZ said we’re very much in altseason now, mStable learned communication the hard way, LEND was up by 8,000% against bitcoin in 12 months, while research found that BTC hashrate could rise 120% in a year, but the price of the coin needs to follow.

Until a decade back, Estonia seemed to be struggling with its economic challenges. The Baltic nation was amongst the poorest countries in the Eurozone and the inhabitants were constantly grappling with models of economic development. The present looks different with one sole reason standing firm right next to the economy, and the reason is – cryptocurrency.

The country now puts forward an extremely favorable picture. There prevails a friendly environment for business, noticeably low taxes, and the pleasure of wireless internet across all streets and localities. Such conditions create a favorable ground for Estoania start-ups. What else adds to the cakewalk is the country’s business registration process that is not cumbersome and time-consuming, unlike most strong economies. In less than an hour, compliance with taxes and banking is established to make sure any establishment is all set and good to go.

Even while being reluctant in facing the revolutionary concept of cryptocurrencies until three years back in 2017, the government never imposed heavy taxes on start-ups. While Bitcoin remains away from VAT tax, there is only more goodness on the cards. As digital assets, these companies or start-ups are barely regulated and tampered with by the government.

What is favorable about the business environment in Estonia?

– In less than €5000 one can set up a limited liability company and start one’s journey.

– Investors across the globe are warmly welcome.

– Registration and Incorporation procedures are well-structured and managed and barely consume an hour.

– Limits have not been erected on cryptocurrency investments, making the market open for all with limitless potential to be tapped.

– Low taxes and cheap electricity costs.

All these factors together turn the nation into a favourable crypto market according to this article from crypto experts “osta bitcoineja”. The spilling promises of it soon turning into a booming and self-sustaining economy.

The laws for business

The legal framework of the country is invitingly structured to invite investments from all parts of the world. The most appealing feature shines through in the form of the e-residency program successfully calling out for investors and start-ups. With dipping incorporation and registration costs, small scale Blockchain start-ups can see a promising ground to let their ventures thrive. The country is also paying detailed attention to such start-ups, especially the ones with an ICO.

ICOs and Estonia: The tryst of the decade

Despite the risk it poses, the country does not seem to intervene in the regulation of this growth model. Back in 2017, some announcements predicted the establishment of state sponsored ICO joining Venezuela in its one of a kind initiatives.

The country planned on development and promotion through Dubbed Estcoin, its Estonian token. The country allows investors to get started without even setting foot in the country and this certainly creates unmatched opportunities for crypto growth. This is what has led to several such start-ups flourishing in the region.

The stance of legal authorities

When it comes to legal authorities, they seem to be nothing but cooperative. Unlike most economies where legal operators are quite the hassle for such start-ups, Estonia seems to be taking a different road. The regulators of the country are approachable and liberal. If the basic rules are not neglected setting up a business is quite a cakewalk. With most processes being taken care of online the trouble of getting started is further watered down. This helps investors achieve the much-needed peace of mind.

Costs of operation

Among all the other benefits, this seems to be the lucrative beacon to them all. Low costs of operation help Blockchain start-ups cleave their way in. As mentioned, the approximate cost remains €4500-€5000. Easy accessibility to the internet only widens the growth opportunities.

To add to it, reinvested profits are not taxed, and income tax does not cross the much-desired average of twenty-one percent. The average cost of energy and corporate tax seems to be quite a relief too.

These factors allow businesses a favourable room to kick start. In comparison to other countries, the exchanges and establishment of cryptocurrency start-ups are admirably smooth and easy.

With countless countries and their ever-wavering stance on cryptocurrencies, Estonia’s openness becomes exemplary in times of need and development. The government and the natives repetitively emphasize their ease of regulations and their welcoming incorporation.

The digital currency economy is steadily approaching a $300 billion market capitalization, as a great number of coins have been seeing decent gains. Bitcoin touched a high of $10,135 on July 26, during the early morning trading sessions, but ethereum is outpacing the top crypto measured by market valuation.

At the time of writing, the crypto economy is a force to be reckoned with as a number of digital assets have grown more valuable this week. Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering between $9,900 and $9,950 during the course of the late afternoon (ET) trading sessions.

BTC is up over 2.3% today and BTC’s overall market cap is just above the $182.6 billion mark. Despite the higher price, BTC’s dominance ratio is lower than it’s been since June 2019 at 61%.

BTC did touch five figures on Sunday, a price observers had not seen since the first week of June. Ethereum has been outperforming BTC by a longshot as the coin is now trading for $307 per coin.

ETH is up 3.6% today and 30% for the week compared to BTC’s 8% seven-day gain. ETH gained 35% during the last 30 days and around 58% over the course of the last 90-days. A number of speculators believe Ethereum’s defi and stablecoin boom is pushing the digital asset’s price to new 2020 levels.

Bitcoin cash (BCH) jumped to the $253 range on Sunday morning but the cryptocurrency is down 0.84% at press time. Bitcoin cash is up 7% for 30 days and 1.7% during the last 90 days. However, for the 12-month time span against the USD, BCH is still down 19% this weekend.

BCH has a market valuation of $4.5 billion from the 18 million BCH in circulation, which represents 1.53% of today’s overall $296 billion crypto market cap. At the time of publication, tether (USDT) captures 61% of today’s BCH trades. This is followed by BTC (17.50%), USD (5.53%), KRW (5.16%), and TWD (3.40%). BCH is getting lots of volume from the New Taiwan dollar (TWD) and ETH pairs represent 1.56%.

Sunday’s top gainers include coins like elysian (ELY 61.02%), datawallet (DXT 40.79%), egretia (EGT 31.50%), elrond (ERD 25.12%), and travala (AVA 25%). The biggest losers today include starbase (STAR -29.16%), zap (ZAP -27.47%) karatgoldcoin (KBC -23.09%), boscoin (BOS -21.54%), and yearnfinance (YFI -21.31%).

The top-performing Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens today include flexcoin (FLEX 8.4%) and brave sound token (BRST 7.1%) The tokens spice (SPICE -1.6%) and Sideshift.ai’s SLP-token (SAI -0.12%) are both down on Sunday. Overall, most crypto traders are bullish, as crypto assets are outshining gold too, which is above the $1900 zone per Troy ounce of .999 fine gold on Sunday.

ETH touched a high on Sunday not seen in well over a year. However, ETH the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, is still 78% down from the digital currency’s all-time high (ATH). That was three years ago from today, and three years for BTC as well, which is doing better considering BTC is only down 50.5% from its ATH.

From the barter system that dates back to 6,000 B.C. to the present-day use of fiat currency, the human race has been on a nonstop journey toward creating more efficient exchange methods. Factors such as convenience, availability, stability and sustainability have played crucial roles in the evolution of exchange methods.

What is fiat currency?

Fiat currency is essentially paper money backed solely by the government’s word and central bank regulations. It became the preferred method of exchange globally at the expense of other methods such as commodity-based currencies and barter. This was owing to its convenience, the relative stability of value and also because it is under government control. Fiat currencies gained prominence in the 20th century partly because governments sought to insulate their economies from the worst effects of the natural fluctuations of the business cycle.

A fiat currency is a legal tender that has value based on the issuing government rather than physical assets. Hence, its value is only as good as the issuing government. Corrupt politicians and irresponsible governments have been culpable of printing excess money to cover up for their lapses. This results in an endless cycle of inflation or, worse yet, a recession. In 2019, Zimbabwe struggled with hyperinflation of more than 300% after a long period of political unrest.

Cryptocurrency

As the world became increasingly digital moving into the 21st century, the need for a secured digitized means of payment became inevitable. Banks and other financial institutions continued to adopt various digital payment methods. The blockchain breakthrough finally arrived in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper on what would become Bitcoin (BTC) — the first and most popular modern cryptocurrency.

As a decentralized means of exchange, the elimination of third parties and central banks is undoubtedly the most significant advantage of cryptocurrency. Unlike fiat currencies, blockchain technology is a public ledger and is tightly regulated by a process called mining. This ensures that all money in circulation is accounted for, promoting transparency and accountability in the technology.

Replacing fiat currencies with cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency edges out fiat currency in processing fast, reliable, efficient means of exchange, especially in a digitized world. However, the technology has to overcome some significant hurdles if it is ever to become more popular than traditional fiat currencies. Here are a few reasons why the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies is complicated:

Governments

Governments and regulatory institutions are among the many barriers that cryptocurrency faces in its bid to emerge as a globally accepted means of exchange. Taxation on distributed ledger technology is complicated because it is independent of governments and traditional banking systems. Besides, politicians and governments can shape economies when they control money circulation. Consequently, by creating hostile policies and dissuading the use of cryptocurrencies, governments can keep a lid on their use and ultimately ensure the flow of fiat currency.

Public perception

Recently, Twitter suffered what could quite possibly be the worst hack since its inception. Celebrities, billionaires and multiple cryptocurrency exchanges were targeted and hacked. The hackers composed different messages asking people to send Bitcoin to a wallet address in order to receive double the amount back, and around $120,000 worth of BTC was lost to the scam.

While the involvement of Bitcoin in the scam doesn’t tell even a quarter of the story, its use in fraud, scams and some dark web activity has been a deterrent to blockchain’s popularity.

Bitcoin mining and energy consumed

As previously mentioned, Bitcoin transactions are verified by a unique process called mining. Transactions on the distributed ledger are confirmed and stored as “blocks of information” by Bitcoin miners. However, mining is a complex and energy-consuming process that requires a high amount of power and energy generation. The University of Cambridge estimates that Bitcoin consumes 0.21% of the electricity the world produces, an amount close to the total electrical consumption of countries such as Romania, Bangladesh and Israel.

As many mining farms all over the world seek to expand their operations to prepare for a future with cryptocurrencies, the big question remains — how sustainable is this energy-consuming process in the long term?

Bitcoin scalability

Originally designed to process seven transactions per second, blockchain technology now faces a huge scalability problem. While the intention of Bitcoin’s developers was solely to prevent hackers from manipulating the technology, the transaction capacity simply can’t accommodate the enormous use of the blockchain.

This would be complicated even further by an increase in industries and investors seeking to adopt the technology. While cryptocurrency experts have debated over the years whether to increase block size or use an exponential scaling-off approach, it remains to be seen whether and how the scalability problem can be put to bed.

While the blockchain technology market is expected to be worth over $39 billion by 2025, its mainstream adoption and eventual replacement of fiat currencies may still be a massive reach. Cryptocurrencies certainly have a long way to go, and investors can sit back and watch how the technology unfolds shortly.

Key Takeaways On-chain activity on Ethereum is growing as DeFi popularity grows

Ethereum is slow, and this is unlikely to change soon

Off-chain solutions are getting implemented to increase Ethereum’s scalability

Share this article

On-chain activity on the Ethereum network has been surging in 2020 to the levels previously seen amid the 2017-2018 bull run. Data suggests that it’s likely due to the rapid expansion of the DeFi sector.

While the growth of on-chain activity is beneficial for Ethereum, it’s low throughput can cause high transaction fees under heavy network load. Expensive transactions, in turn, are prohibitive for DeFi usage.

Etherum 2.0 could solve many of the network’s current scalability issues, but it’s unlikely to come anytime soon. In the meantime, there are several already available scalability solutions to accommodate the network’s rising activity.

The numbers of daily active addresses and daily transactions have been enjoying steady growth in 2020, suggesting that more people come to use the network. Importantly, people mostly move around ERC-20 tokens, while the number of ETH daily transactions has stayed around 2 million over several months.

Many of the platforms with the highest number of transactions, like 1inch.exchange, Synthetix, and Matcha, all belong to the DeFi sector, indicating the decentralized finance movement is responsible for the surge in on-chain activity.

As the on-chain activity increases, the network becomes congested. As a consequence, transactions become more expensive.

Miners fill blocks with transactions from a transaction pool. If the pool receives transactions too fast, users have to pay higher fees to push their transactions to the front of the queue. If a fee is set too low, a transaction may hang in the pool for a long time. This delay can be disastrous for traders on the hunt for ever-changing and lucrative yields.

The pool for pending transactions can get filled fast, given the low network’s throughput of 14 transactions per second (TPS). As the queue grows, the premium for pushing a transaction to the front increases as well. As a result, the network becomes inefficient and expensive under a substantial load. Examples of this dynamic include Crypto Kitties and FCoin, which have caused considerable congestion in the past.

To solve this bottleneck, developers in the Ethereum community are working to transition the network form a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. A PoS algorithm would offer users a cheaper and more efficient Ethereum experience.

Unfortunately, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been delayed time and again. And without these upgrades, the DeFi boom may be capped due to the low TPS barrier and, thus, high transaction costs.

Ethereum 2.0 Isn’t the Only Solution

The primary reason behind Ethereum 2.0’s delayed roll-out is risk. With so much on-chain value and activity, the stakes are high to get it right. Thus, to help cater to current bottlenecks, developers have launched an “Ethereum 1.x” initiative, which focuses on improving the existing network while building Ethereum 2.0 in parallel.

Several teams are working on various Ethereum 1.x-related proposals. The list includes Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-1108, EIP-1844, EIP-2028, and EIP-2200.

The improvements mentioned above were able to lower on-chain transaction fees and created advantages for implementing off-chain solutions.

The most sensible way to significantly scale Ethereum before version 2.0 becomes functional is moving some transactions off-chain. Although Layer 2 networks, like Lightning Network on Bitcoin, don’t enjoy the same level of security as the underlying layer, they are relatively safe and practical.

Ethereum developers have been experimenting with off-chain setups for a while. One use case for off-chain transactions includes state and payment channels. These allow several users to lock up ETH on Layer 1 and transact or change state on Layer 2 fast and without congesting the network.

The Plasma network, for instance, resembles state and payment channels, except that the Layer 2 chain serves users in general.

The major downside of state channels and Plasma is that they don’t have strong support for smart contracts, limiting their usage. Another popular alternative is optimistic rollups, which can provide a substantial increase of 1,000 TPS with smart-contract support.

I think we'll see stuff move to l2 very soon. USDT + OMG

DeFi + optimistic rollups — eric.eth (@econoar) July 23, 2020

Optimistic rollups offer a similar setup to PoS. There are off-chain aggregators acting like validators (nodes).

All the transactions that happen on Layer 2, including smart-contract interactions, are periodically summarized by nodes with stakes and submitted to Layer 1. These submissions are verifiable by anyone, so nodes risk to lose their stakes if they act maliciously.

Another way to put computation off-chain is by using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs enable a party performing computations to prove that they’ve actually done them without revealing how. Instead of providing the entire operation history, ZK proofs create mathematical proofs of this history. These proofs are much smaller in size and thus offer more efficient use of blockchain space while still guarding the data’s integrity.

Such an approach is useful for setups like decentralized exchanges (DEXes). These trading platforms can move order processing off-chain to preserve the Ethereum network’s bandwidth and make DEXes comfortable to use.

State channels, Plasma, Optimistic Rollup, and ZK proofs are the building blocks of Ethereum’s scalability.

Who’s Building?

Ethereum indisputably has the largest developer community in the blockchain space. Developers come because of the large user base, so they have to overcome the platform’s limitations to provide services under the current TPS restriction.

Raiden Network, Perun Network, State Channels, Celer Network, Machinomy, FunFair, and Liquidity Network are all building Ethereum state channels. The state channel niche is rather small and not widely popular. For example, Raiden Network was once making headlines but now occupies 300-400 rank on CoinMarketCap.

Plasma is more popular, given that some of the top-100 CoinMarketCap projects like Matic Network and OMG Network are using it. Importantly, Matic uses a modified version of Plasma along with PoS-based side chains, which enables it to host dApps. Such a solution has a potential value for DeFi projects.

Optimistic rollups have probably received the most attention from DeFi projects. The pilot implementation, Unipig, was jointly built by Plasma Group and Uniswap exchange, one of the top Ethereum DeFi dApps.

Optimistic Rollup is an incredibly exciting L2 solution that scales interoperable, fully general Solidity smart contracts on Ethereum. Unipig was built to demonstrate both the capabilities and huge UX benefits of Optimistic Rollup. DeFi can and will scale 2/ — Uniswap Protocol 🦄 (@UniswapProtocol) October 8, 2019

Following Unipig launch, Synthetix tapped into Optimistic rollups. The exchange is famous for tokenizing traditional financial instruments like commodities and Forex and making them available for trading against cryptocurrencies. Synthetix demoed an optimistic rollup implementation, which showed subsecond transaction confirmation times, putting user experience on par with centralized players like Binance.

ZK proofs in the form of ZK-STARKS have been lately adopted by DeFi projects as well. ZK-STARKS are developed by StarkWare, which received $4M with 6K ETH Performance-based bounties from the Ethereum Foundation.

ZK-STARKS enable ZK proofs in trustless setups. DeversiFi, a decentralized exchange formerly known as Ethfinex, became the first DEX to implement ZK-STARKS. The platform can now achieve over 9,000 TPS.

Besides scalability solutions, there is also Chi Gastoken introduced by 1inch, a highly-popular DEX aggregator. The token allows users to buy and store gas when prices are low. The major downside is that if the network is continuously congested, Gastokens minted earlier get used up, and there is no opportunity to mint the new tokens because gas is expensive. As a result, this solution doesn’t always work as expected.

Closing Thoughts on Ethereum Scaling

Although Ethereum is unlikely to shift to a fully functional PoS network anytime soon, DeFi and other dApps are far from doomed. The Layer 2 scalability workarounds have practical value given their adoption by popular DeFi projects. The blockchain space is still small, so an extra few thousand TPS and smart contract support should be enough for Ethereum to take advantage of the DeFi boom in the medium-term.

She asked: “Is crypto fintech?”

My instinctive answer was “no!” For me, fintech is technology applied to finance, while cryptocurrency is a technology unto itself. That technology is giving rise to a new type of finance.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

But something about that rationale felt a bit glib, so I wrestled with it some more. And then some more. And after way too long staring at the screen and wrinkling my forehead, I may be taking tentative steps into the “yes” camp, but with some heavy caveats.

What is 'fintech'?

To start, let’s look closer at what we mean by “fintech.”

The term is the portmanteau of “financial” and “technology,” and most definitions stress the latter’s influence on finance. “Finance” is usually defined as “the management of money.”

Does crypto help with the management of money? Although they may have money-like qualities, cryptocurrencies are not yet generally recognized as such* as they are not widely accepted as a medium of exchange. Yet, they can help move money around, allow it to express opinions in new forms and generate returns in creative ways.

Of all the definitions of fintech from official organizations that I’ve read, the Financial Stability Board’s choice of words is perhaps the most inclusive: “Technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services.”

New business models. Check. New applications and processes. Check. Associated material effect on financial markets and institutions. Double check.

The “technologically enabled financial innovation” part is perhaps problematic, as crypto is about so much more than “financial innovation,” but it’s not wrong.

What is 'crypto'?

We should probably define “crypto” as well. The term originates with cryptography, which has to do with the security of information, and is widely used in its abbreviated form to refer to all things blockchain, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, smart contracts, etc.

Most of these concepts are being adopted by the financial world to try to re-imagine how securities move, how companies can raise funds, and even how currencies function.

This past week Standard Chartered, about as “traditional finance” as you can get (its origins go back to 1853), announced the pending launch of a crypto custody service. More details are emerging on the plans of PayPal, long a darling of the fintech sector, to offer crypto services. MUFG, Japan’s largest banking firm, is developing its own crypto token for use in a smartphone payment app. In his timely report for crypto API provider Zabo called “Fintech Adoption of Cryptocurrency,” Alex Treece highlights how the rolling out of crypto-asset services boosted valuations of fintech firms Robinhood, Revolut and Square. Visa issued a statement this week in which it bragged that it was “reshaping how money moves across the globe,” and in the very next sentence talked about the “exciting avenue” of digital currencies.

So, fintech seems to be increasingly embracing crypto. But is crypto fintech? It does seem to be becoming part of the fintech set. It is a technology impacting how finance is handled. So, in some ways it is – but it’s also more than that.

Time for a refresh?

We should note that the term “fintech” is trying to put an edgy spin on an age-old concept. Financial innovation is not new, as material changes to how money is managed were triggered by the telegraph, telephone, centralized ticker service, complex derivatives and more.

Even in its modern application, it is becoming outdated because there are few traditional finance firms that don’t already heavily rely on new technologies to reach and grow client bases.

Given the impact of crypto-based innovation on our understanding and application of financial concepts, surely we can come up with something better. Using a tired catch-all for something so significant is like trying to put a formidable force into a tidy bucket.

So far, the technologies making the biggest waves in fintech are the internet and AI – they are game changing, for sure, but their innovation stems from the creation and treatment of radically new types of data.

Crypto is also a data innovation, but it goes much further – it’s an innovation of authority. And since the power of finance stems from the authority conferred to it and by it, the potential impact of crypto goes beyond what previous technologies have managed to achieve.

The technologies we apply to finance matter, as technology shapes what we do and how we do it. The internet, for instance, changed how we carry out age-old activities such as writing letters or grocery shopping. It also gave rise to entirely new activities such as video conferencing and fighting zombies (at least I think that’s new).

Fintech has been a transformative force; changing financial habits and attracting new audiences is no small feat. Crypto should be thrilled that it is being thought of as a tool that could join mainstream financial innovation. Yet it is not going to settle for just that.

The impact of new technologies on how we handle money should not be underestimated. But no technology until now has attempted to change our understanding of money.

(*As I’m writing this, it has just been revealed that bitcoin is now considered money in the context of money transmission licensing, only in Washington D.C.)

Anyone know what's going on yet?

This week in markets had both good news and bad.

On the good news, they say times of crisis bring people closer together. The European rescue package was seen as a step toward greater fiscal unity, and has boosted investor sentiment in European markets and in the euro.

And, at time of writing, S&P 500 year-to-date returns are now in positive territory, which is astonishing. Easy money is obviously a more powerful market driver than high unemployment, geopolitical tensions and uncertain growth.

The dollar, on the other hand, is trending weaker against most major currencies, and looks headed toward its worst month since early 2018. The COVID-19 case tally continues to go from bad to worse, China-U.S. relations have hit a new low and the likelihood that the global economy might not bounce back after all seems to finally be sinking in.

Source: CoinDesk Research, FactSet

Bitcoin seems to finally be moving out of its doldrums, rising over the weekend to reach a gain of almost 10% on the week. Could this be the reawakening of crypto animal spirits?

CHAIN LINKS

This news is potentially a very big deal: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said in a public letter that any national bank can now custody digital assets for its clients.

Until now, custody has been the province of specialist firms, which typically needed a state license, such as a trust charter, to offer the service to institutional investors. Now, large, regulated financial companies that already provide similar safekeeping services for stock certificates and the like could broaden their service.

Many institutional investors are probably more likely to use a custodian they are already familiar with and who has a line to federal dollars, a better-capitalized balance sheet and bankruptcy rules that protect customer assets.

Caitlin Long points out there is still legal uncertainty for banks transacting with crypto assets in the U.S., because commercial law treatment of many crypto assets is still unclear.

She also explains why a bank license totally trumps a trust charter and New York’s BitLicense when it comes to crypto custody, and that existing custodians are going to have to merge with banks to stay competitive.

Also, it is probably more efficient for banks to buy the technology and expertise than try to build it from scratch.

It is not clear whether banks will be allowed to extend their custody services to cover the rapidly growing demand for staking, in which digital assets are locked up in specific wallets for governance purposes, in exchange for a yield.

A significant component of banks’ custody services for traditional assets includes securities lending – will they also enter the crypto lending business?

Alex Mascioli, head of institutional services for digital asset prime broker Bequant, reminded us we should not expect a stampede of traditional banks into the crypto asset space – most don’t care.

My colleagues Nik De and Ian Allison spoke to Washington insiders who agree that banks are unlikely to move quickly here, and that larger financial institutions are likely to want more reassurance before they enter the space.

The OCC is currently headed up by Brian Brooks, a former executive at crypto exchange Coinbase. We expected him to attempt to push forward crypto-friendly reform, but to be honest I didn’t think he’d be able to get something this significant through so quickly. This leaves me optimistic that there may be more positive surprises in store.

Standard Chartered has revealed that its venture and innovation arm has been working on a crypto custody offering for the institutional market and the first pilot could launch later this year. TAKEAWAY: This is the most significant step from a large incumbent into the crypto markets so far – Standard Chartered is present in 70 countries, and is one of the 100 largest companies in terms of market cap listed on the London Stock Exchange. Apparently it was considering setting up a crypto marketplace, but realized that a significant barrier for its clients was the lack of big-balance-sheet custody services. So far, about 20 institutions have expressed interest, according to the company, which is not insignificant but nor is it a huge amount. It remains to be seen how this strategy fits in with its recent investment in Switzerland-based institutional crypto custodian Metaco.

Avanti, a crypto-focused financial company known as a Special Purpose Depositary Institution (SPDI) based in Wyoming and founded by long-time crypto advocate Caitlin Long, will launch in October. TAKEAWAY: Avanti aims to compete with traditional banks for crypto business, and has a head start, not just in terms of its crypto credibility (Caitlin Long has been instrumental in pushing forward blockchain-friendly legislation in Wyoming, which other states are starting to emulate). It also has the flexibility to innovate on how banking works, and has started with a token called the Avit. Details are still thin, but it seems like it will be a digital token for settlement purposes, not pegged to the U.S. dollar but issued by a bank under existing U.S. commercial laws, which confer transaction finality. I’m looking forward to learning more about this.

The price of ether, ethereum’s native token, has more than doubled so far this year, dwarfing bitcoin’s +34% rise. But its fees have risen by much more, signalling growing congestion on the network. ETH fees are now averaging well over $1 per transaction, up from just $0.04 at the beginning of the year. TAKEAWAY: Proposals are in the works to reform the fee structure, and the whole network is heading toward a profound technology change that should solve the scaling problem (we dive into the upcoming change in detail in our latest report “Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters”). These changes will take time, however, and escalating fees tend to eventually choke activity on a network. For now, though, the transaction count is showing no signs of abating. Worth watching.

yes, we're also wondering what the fee spikes were for... Source: Coin Metrics

The universe of listed crypto companies is still small (my colleague Matt Yamamoto has written reports on two of them: Ebang and Hut 8), but that could well change in the very near future. TAKEAWAY: With Ant Financial listing on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, and a rumored Coinbase listing in the offing, there could soon be high-market-cap opportunities for all types of investors. An argument can be made that this would be even better for the sector than a bitcoin ETF, as funds flowing into listed crypto companies would spread mainstream investment across a range of crypto assets and blockchain applications, rather than just bitcoin.

To get an idea of the potential impact of even a teensy portion of U.S. equity investment reaching the crypto sector, my colleague Shuai Hao prepared this scorching graphic:

And for any current or future token enthusiasts out there who have kids (or were once one themselves), you can now get a Dr. Seuss collectible non-fungible token (NFT) of your very own. TAKEAWAY: NFTs may sound like a quirky niche application now, but they could end up playing a significant role in markets through the creation of investment opportunities in art, for instance. Or, and here it could get even more interesting, in identity applications. An NFT basically enjoys all the same advantages of blockchain-based tokens (ease of transfer, traceability, sovereign control, etc.) – but there is a verifiably limited number. It could be one, it could be 10 or 100, but the scarcity and lack of fungibility are part of the value proposition.

One year ago, the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, ruled that crypto transactions data should be controllable, and ever since the question has been not if you know your customers (KYC) but how you do it.

But not all bitcoiners have surrendered to this norm. Hodl Hodl and Bisq don’t provide centralized custody and don’t check user identity. They also don’t employ the blockchain tracing tools to block the “tainted” coins (blacklisted as coming from illicit activities), which has become a must for major bitcoin exchanges these days.

What comes with this? A chance to buy and sell bitcoin without revealing your identity, as well as much more responsibility over how you buy and store your crypto. Max Keidun, the CEO of Hodl Hodl, and Steve Jain, contributor to Bisq, dig into why, in the times of crypto compliance, people still might need (or maybe just lawfully want) to keep their bitcoin deals to themselves.

During the last two weeks, I’ve been roaming around the virtual world Decentraland in order to get some perspective on the platform supported by the Ethereum Blockchain. The following is a review of my experience in Decentraland and observing all that has been built since it was invoked over four years ago.

Four years ago, the platform Decentraland stemmed from a proof-of-concept that assigned ownership of digital real estate in an infinite 2D grid. When the creators did this, it was originally dubbed the “Stone Age of the Decentralized.” The team behind Decentraland then finished crafting a 3D virtual world divided into plots called the “Bronze Age” at the end of 2016. Fast forward to 2020, and Decentraland, the metaverse built on Ethereum is massive.

Essentially, the world is a blockchain fueled virtual reality platform and users can explore, create, play games, collect wearables, monetize creation, leverage land plots, and 3D building techniques. After the “Bronze Age,” Decentraland moved into the “Iron Age” which involves the ability to interact with the virtual world in various ways and leverage the native cryptocurrency MANA to process payments.

I’ve known about Decentraland for a while now, and just recently decided to explore the metaverse during the last two weeks. I decided to write a review on the platform in order to give news.Bitcoin.com readers some perspective on this fascinating land and the best way to experience the platform. In order to leverage Decentraland, you need a wallet that interacts with ETH-based decentralized applications (dapps). I leveraged the Metamask wallet with the Chrome browser and fired up a new ETH account.

In addition to writing the review and exploring Decentraland, I also involved my two sons Joshua and Franklin. I wanted to get opinions from people who are much younger than me in order to see how they liked the platform. After creating a new Metamask-based ETH address, I simply went over to the website Decentraland.org.

The first thing my sons and I did was head over to the Avatar section and we created my Avatar or how I look when I am traveling the virtual world. Choosing the look is similar to a number of Avatar creators people are used to like Nintendo’s Miis and other programs.

After customizing your look, the program asks you if you want to grab your “Passport” to manage your digital identity. Meaning, anyone can pay 100 MANA (Decentraland’s ERC20 token) in order to obtain a custom name. Now after you customize your Avatar, you do not need to pay 100 MANA or register right away or at all.

You can also simply explore Decentraland as a guest. My sons decided that I should choose a name and I chose “Jamiecrypto” for my Decentraland Passport name. You can grab MANA by simply swapping ETH for Decentraland’s native currency using the Metamask wallet’s swapping feature.

The name “Jamiecrypto” was available, and I opened up a contract in order to obtain the name. However, because gas is so expensive right now I waited two solid days to finally get fed up, and pay $4.50 in gas to push the contract settlement. Ethereum’s fees are problematic right now and the issue will make Decentraland less fluid if the chain does not scale. Understanding this issue, I didn’t care too much and moved on, but this will definitely deter users from exploring Decentraland to its fullest extent.

After pressing “start exploring” at the Decentraland.org website it connected with my Metamask account and I entered the “Genesis Plaza” This area is like a introductory zone that has a number of cool buildings and a robot that gives you an explanation of Decentraland and what you can do.

After listening to the welcome robot, my sons told me to start roaming around and I did but I was leveraging a Macbook Pro with the built-in trackpad. Using a trackpad is slow and not the best accessory to use while you explore Decentraland.

My son Joshua who is used to playing virtual world games like Roblox, told me we should hook up a mouse in order to move around. After hooking up a mouse, it was much easier to move around Decentraland and users can also press “/help” in order to learn the control mechanisms.

We all decided that I should roam around the “Genesis Plaza” and my sons wanted to explore the big brown building that resembles a shoe. This building is like a history museum of Decentraland and artifacts explain how it was built, how the governance system (DAO) works, and some of the hosted activities that take place in the virtual world.

The three of us stopped for a minute to observe a poster of a John Perry Barlow’s “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace” and my oldest son Joshua read the paragraph which says:

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

Decentraland has all kinds of artwork, buildings, and unique things, and the “Genesis Plaza” is one small aspect of this world. While exploring the plaza, we saw mountainous terrain that looked like a volcano and the “NFT Hallway,” which displays a number of non-fungible tokens (collectibles, artwork, wearables.)

Lots of the NFT shops are all over Decentraland and some NFTs are for show, while others can be purchased by using MANA. For instance, the shop from the crew at Digitible offers a number of NFTs and Ross Ulbricht collectibles as well. The funds spent on Digitable-crafted Ross wearables go directly to the Ulbricht family.

Of course, my kids wanted to buy everything in the virtual world of Decentraland. But during the entire exploration period, the only thing I spent MANA on was my custom name and the fee to settle the contract. Users can purchase wearables at the Decentraland Marketplace as well which sells hats, hoodies, shoes, shirts, and land parcels as well.

I found that everything in the entire marketplace was extremely expensive and I just couldn’t fathom paying hundreds of dollars worth of MANA on a virtual hoodie. This is another criticism my kids and I had with Decentraland, and we all thought the game would be far more enjoyable if NFT goods were cheaper.

Decentraland is massive, and in order to warp to other places in the virtual world simply press “M” on the keyboard. This loads the map and my son’s and I visited places like the Scifi Plaza, the Asian Plaza, Metazone Tower, Battle Racers, Crypto Valley, and the Crypto Valley Art Museum, the Museum District, Pixelchain, Bartertown, Decentraland University, and many more areas.

Over the course of two weeks, my sons and I still have not explored every crevice and plot in Decentraland. Joshua and Franklin enjoyed all the things that you could ride like the Ferris Wheel, race tracks, and the many obstacles throughout the metaverse.

My favorite place was the Crypto Valley Art Museum and the donut shop with two police cruisers sitting in front of the shop. My oldest son Joshua explores Decentraland on his own now too, as he downloaded Metamask on his own laptop and fires up the virtual world to explore.

Yesterday, he added me as a friend by simply searching my name “Jamiecrypto” and we both explored Decentraland together on separate computers. During the last few months, Decentraland explorers hold small community events and gatherings. A few days ago, comic book illustrator Jose Delbo answered questions about his digital artwork in Decentraland during an exhibition.

Joshua is ten so he enjoyed the program a lot more than his seven-year-old brother Franklin. Overall, we all thought the experience is enjoyable and it’s very cool to see a virtual world built on top of the Ethereum network. My two sons also enjoyed the fact that they used a Metamask wallet for interaction and how the ETH chain powers the entire world.

The only issue I had with the entire Decentraland experience was the high ETH gas fees, which are a problem for every defi application right now and the expensive gear. I think that people marketing virtual wearables should come down on their prices, but I can see that happening if Decentraland gathers more users.

What do you think about the Decentraland experience? Let us know in the comments below.

It now has five million more users than it did last July.

It also noted the phenomenal growth of DeFi—but said the technology is still very young.

Coinbase now has over 35 million users in over 100 countries, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange said in a new report.

San Francisco-based Coinbase said in its Crypto H1 2020 institutional review that it now operates the largest regulated exchange in the world—and it is continuing to grow.

The 35 million users mark, which includes its retail and institutional clients, is up five million from last year.

Last July, Alistair Milne, the CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, the London-based crypto arm of the Altana Investments hedge fund, tweeted a spreadsheet showing Coinbase’s growth year-on-year.

It showed a growth of five million in 10 months. Coinbase did not say how many of these users are active users; some users may be dormant.

[ad-unit /]

The Coinbase report added that crypto is also continuing to be adopted by traditional finance. It noted that “many larger and more conservative institutional investors are allocating for the first time, using Coinbase to build direct positions and backing crypto fund managers as part of their alternatives strategy.”

This has always been Coinbase’s aim: the exchange has its Prime platform for financial institutions looking to trade with business funds, and Coinbase Custody, which provides financial institutions with a safe and secure means to store digital assets.

Coinbase’s review of the cryptocurrency landscape also noted the explosion of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which has in part been fueled by the exchange. Last month, it listed the top DeFi token Compound last month and in December gave their users the opportunity to earn DAI by opening a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) on the Maker platform.

The exchange said in the report that while it believes DeFi “will be extremely powerful long-term,” users should note that “the market is still in its infancy.” But Coinbase added that they will “continue to support the growth of DeFi protocols” through their own products and investments.",2020-07-26 14:26:13,,,

Bitcoin hit $10,964 on spot exchange Coinbase Monday, a price level not seen since August 2019. “The bitcoin breakout seemed to finally have happened as we lifted off from $9,800,” said Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative trading firm Kronos Research. “The trend is clear and we are headed higher.”

Bitcoin trading volume on Coinbase Monday was at $292 million. This was the highest since June 11, when volumes hit $255 million.

Traders have long discussed the $10,500 price range as a level to stay above to fuel a lengthy bull run, said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at Chicago-based crypto liquidity provider Blockfills. “We need to stay over $10,500, so I would probably want to see a sharp interest in demand above that and to stay over it for more than 24 hours to see if the bullishness has legs,” Van Huis said.

Despite the excitement Monday, bitcoin’s jump might compel selling in the alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoin, market, said Kronos’ Tan. “Unfortunately, this might actually suck the energy out of the altcoins and high-flying DeFi tokens.”

One dynamic to watch: The ETH/BTC pair Monday is down 4% on Coinbase as traders are selling ether for bitcoin on the spot market.

Regardless of the rebalancing, Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote, says DeFi is the main reason for the cryptocurrency markets’ move up overall. “It’s purely DeFi driven,” said Chris Thomas. “We will likely see a lot more of this, resulting in ether driving higher and pulling everything else with it.”

Ethereum fees jump 550% in 2020

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday trading around $323 and climbing 5.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

In January, the average fee on the Ethereum network was 0.000542 ETH. So far in July, average fees on Ethereum are at 0.003532 ETH, a 550% increase in the cost to conduct transactions on the second-largest blockchain by market cap, according to data aggregator Blockchair.

“The recent rise of ether’s price could be explained by the fact that large users and investors in the DeFi ecosystem are buying ETH now in order to pay less gas fees for each transaction,” said Jean-Baptiste Pavageau partner at Paris-based quant firm ExoAlpha.

Some traders may be taking advantage of this rise in fees, stockpiling ether as the situation may only exacerbate as 2020 continues. “Speculators are actively monitoring the DeFi ecosystem and are anticipating growth of the Ethereum network over the coming months, increasing the demand in ether to pay for the gas fee of each transaction,” added Pavageau.

Before being hit by the Coronavirus pandemic, BTC was trading at about $10,000. In March, however, its price nearly halved when it traded at prices as low as $5,678 for some weeks.

CBN Calls Cryptocurrency a ‘Gamble’

Since then, it has made a slow but gradual return towards the $10,000 benchmark. By the end of April, the cryptocurrency’s price had soared back to values above $9000. Making its way back is significant because it indicates that the BTC has made a full recovery from the plunge it suffered in March.

Not just BTC price increased within the second quarter

During the second quarter of the year, there was an increase in the number of addresses that held between 1 and 10 BTC. Within the quarter, the number of addresses increased to 667,000.

Addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC also increased during the period, growing by more than 3% since the end of April.

Since the crash on March 12, the Bitcoin market has been providing higher lows, showing that the BTC is still heading upward. With the flagship cryptocurrency crossing the $10,000 threshold again, analysts expect that if market lows beyond $9,300 are not exceeded, the price of BTC should head towards upper levels of $11,000 and $11,600.

This is still not close to its lifetime high of $20,000 which it traded at in December, 2017. However, reaching the next targets of $11,000 and $11,500 will result in a further surge of the whole cryptocurrency markets.

There are predictions that the BTC will cross new heights before the end of 2021. PlanB expects the BTC to hit the $100,000 mark by the end of 2021.

“Somewhere between and year and a year-and-a-half after the [May 2020] halving, so say before Christmas 2021, bitcoin should be, or should have been above $100,000,” PlanB told Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal.

Bitcoin trader, Peter Brandt, however expects the cryptocurrency to hit new heights of $50,000, although he did not give a timeframe.

XRP Purchases?

Payburner is a new, non-custodial payments platform based on XRP that will work on the Chrome and Brave web browsers. Built as a labor of love by Ripple executive Craig DeWitt, the platform leverages Xpring, a Ripple project that provides tools and funding for developers and startups working with XRP. Released in beta, Payburner can be used to purchase goods online using the XRP cryptocurrency.

Twitch Hitches With

Twitch is giving subscribers a 10% discount if they pay in bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash or litecoin. The Amazon-owned company, with around 3.8 million broadcasters in Q1 2020 and around 1.44 million concurrent users as of March 2020, announced the deal on Saturday. Twitch first introduced a cryptocurrency payment option in 2014, removed it in early 2019 and brought it back a few months later. The company uses the U.S.-based BitPay to process its crypto payments.

Decentralized Derivatives

FTX will launch an exchange for the growing DeFi space on top of the Solana blockchain. Called Serum, the decentralized exchange will be geared towards derivatives, and aims to solve some of the structural vulnerabilities and limitations in the existing DeFi space. Solana claims it can process 50,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum’s 15. The new dex will be fully interoperable with Ethereum so it can tap into the existing DeFi space, which saw its market cap break the $4 billion boundary over the weekend.

Bitcoin Is Money

Bitcoin is a form of “money” in Washington, D.C., a federal court said Friday. The ruling came as part of the United States v. Harmon, where Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that money “commonly means a medium of exchange, method of payment, or store of value… Bitcoin is these things.” The court’s decision to define bitcoin as money was in the context of a case alleging money laundering under federal law. Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Coin Center, said the court’s comments mean that bitcoin “is treated as money in the context of money transmission licensing in D.C., nothing more.”

At stake

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space crossed a milestone: MakerDAO’s total value locked-in is now over $1 billion. $1.1 billion, to be exact.

Built primarily on the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi has become crypto’s most vibrant sector. Nearly $3.6 billion is currently flowing through its interlinked protocols and applications, up from $1 billion in early February, according to DeFi Pulse.

It’s the latest emergent industry that the “world’s computer” has unlocked. In just five years, Ethereum has given rise to crypto’s most promising use cases – and some of its biggest regrets.

From ICOs to stablecoins, and dapps to DAOs, Ethereum’s programmable, decentralized network has grown into a platform for real financial and technological experimentation. Plus, as CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen reporters, Ethereans know how to have fun while disrupting everything.

The Golden Context

Bitcoin finally passed the $10,000 mark over the weekend. First Mover asks why this hadn’t happened sooner. In the past month, fears of stagflation have settled in due to the greenback’s devaluation and an underutilized labor market in the U.S. This has pushed gold’s prices – seen as a hedge against inflation – to all-time highs of $1,940 (passing the previous ceiling of $1,921 an ounce in 2011). Bitcoin, meanwhile, has been stuck in a narrow trading range since April and only recently passed the $10,000 threshold, approximately half of its 2017 all-time-high of $20,000. “Bitcoin has its own microeconomics very unique to crypto, including mining difficulty cycles, the changing regulatory environment and other factors that have little to do with inflation,” Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR, said.

Mining Profits

Ethereum miners’ daily income has soared over 60% in a month, according to Sparkpool. The profitability is tied to soaring transaction fees and relatively slow growth in competition from other miners. Daily income was around $1.85 per 100 megahashes second (MH/s) on the network on June 27, rising as high as $3.27 on July 25. This surge has outpaced ether’s (ETH) price jump of 40% over the same period.

Opinion

Crypto’s Outthinking Fintech’s Box

Crypto is so much more than fintech. In the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter, CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, argues fintech is a tired word to describe financial innovation. While crypto creates new pathways for moving money around and generating returns, it’s also a data innovation and an innovation of authority, leading to new and revised ideas of what money is and can be. “Given the impact of crypto-based innovation on our understanding and application of financial concepts, surely we can come up with something better. Using a tired catch-all for something so significant is like trying to put a formidable force into a tidy bucket.

Earlier this year, digital-asset investors were aflutter over the trillions of dollars of central bank money injections in response to the coronavirus-induced global recession. The bet was the flood of liquidity would eventually lead to inflation, in turn driving up prices for both gold, historically seen as a hedge against currency debasement, and bitcoin, sometimes referred to as “digital gold” or “Gold 2.0” due to its scarce supply.

Yet, since the end of April, when the coronavirus-related market gyrations subsided, bitcoin has lagged behind gold, frustrating the cryptocurrency’s investment narrative.

Gold prices have surged during the period, last week topping the all-time closing high of $1,891.90 an ounce reached in 2011, and are now trading at a record intraday high of $1,940 per ounce. The previous lifetime high of $1,921 was reached in September 2011.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, has been stuck in a narrow trading range since April and only just last night clambered to $10,200, a level not far off half of its all-time-high of $20,000 reached in 2017.

According to a handful of investors and analysts interviewed by CoinDesk, bitcoin is far less mature than gold and thus may lack a credible history as an inflation hedge. So it’s struggled to draw hedging bids despite a recent uptick in inflation expectations.

“Bitcoin’s inflation sensitivity hasn’t been tested in the last 10 years as there hasn’t been a sustained rise in price pressures.” Charlie Morris, founder of the investment firm ByteTree Asset Management, said in an audio interview via WhatsApp.

It’s a shift in tone from a few months ago, when the bullish hype over bitcoin was so ubiquitous it crowded out any reservations about bitcoin’s limited trading history or market size. Suddenly, there’s no shortage of caveats to explain why bitcoin hasn’t reflected the inflation expectations that seem to be buoying gold.

To add insult to injury, other corners of cryptocurrency markets are white-hot: ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has gained some 150% this year. Bitcoin is up 42% in 2020.

“Bitcoin has its own microeconomics very unique to crypto, including mining difficulty cycles, the changing regulatory environment and other factors that have little to do with inflation,” Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR, told First Mover in a Telegram chat.

U.S. inflation expectations, as implied in the market for the U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, have risen to 1.51%, the highest since February. They’ve climbed from 0.5% on March 19, as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded by more than $3 trillion.

Bitcoin initially rose alongside the uptick in inflation expectations. The move from $3,867 to $10,000 seen in the two months to mid-May was likely fueled by the bullish narrative surrounding the May 12 halving. Since then, the cryptocurrency was locked in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 up until July 26, while inflation expectations continued to rise.

Gold, however, has drawn a consistent bid over the past four months, given its long history of serving as an inflation hedge, according to Joseph Trevisani, an analyst at FXStreet and former proprietary trader at Credit Suisse.

The yellow metal rose by an average 15% in real or inflation adjusted terms in the eight years between 1974 to 2008 when annual U.S. inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was above 5%, according to the Journal of Wealth Management. Gold more than doubled to about $1,920 from $850 in the three years following the mid-2008 crash, as the Fed’s emergency liquidity injections pushed inflation expectations higher.

“Gold’s history as an inflation hedge is well known,” Trevisani told First Mover in a Slack chat. “Gold is a long-standing hedge against catastrophe. Bitcoin is not, or at least it is unproven.”

Indeed, bitcoin’s entire existence, since it was launched in early 2009, has taken place in a low inflation environment. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell from 1.6% to -0.62% in the two years through 2013, and it remained stuck in a range between 0% and 0.8% from 2014 to January 2020. That’s well below the Fed’s 2% target for annual inflation.

The gold market, at around $10 trillion, has sufficient depth and liquidity to absorb large hedging-related or haven inflows. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is comparatively paltry, at $189 billion.

“Gold is like a tanker, while bitcoin is much more like a speedboat,” Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, told First Mover in a telephone interview. “However, looking out three to five years, you’ll see the trajectory of both, and you’ll say both were an inflation play.”

Another factor stopping institutions and other traditional investors from making big portfolio allocations to bitcoin is a belief that its price action and network fundamentals aren’t as intimately connected as gold to the fate of the global economy.

“Bitcoin is interesting but I think that it tells us little about anything in the real world,” Marc Chandler, a former chief currency strategist for the giant British bank HSBC, told First Mover in a LinkedIn chat.

Central banks, which don’t invest in bitcoin, often buy gold in times of stress, and they were net buyers during the virus-stricken first quarter, according to the data source Gold Hub.

“Nothing is up quite as much as gold,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Friday in an email to subscribers. “The absence of a major bitcoin rally is also a bit puzzling, especially as one of the leading narratives for the current action in gold is the lack of confidence in central banks. Possibly it will join in later on. I guess we’ll see.”

After bitcoin’s rise on Sunday, only time will tell if that process has just started.

Trend: Bitcoin may be on the cusp of major bull run, having cleared a major resistance at the weekend, according to one analyst.

The cryptocurrency jumped over 8% in the seven days to July 26, violating a trendline connecting the December 2017 and July 2019 highs. “This could be the real deal, we could be on the first serious step towards a bull run of epic magnitude,” popular analyst Lark Davis tweeted early on Monday.

Some traders are now betting on a move to $20,000 over the next four months. Indeed, the breakout above the 2.5-year-long falling trendline is a major bullish development. However, BTC is yet to cross above resistance at $10,400 – a horizontal resistance line drawn linking the February and June highs.

The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to keep gains above $10,000 over the last 12 months. As such, the bulls would be better off observing caution as long as prices are held below $10,400.

A break above that level, if confirmed, would open the doors to $11,000. On the other hand, a failure to establish a strong foothold above $10,000 could invite stronger selling pressure.

The digital currency was trading at $10,196.27 at around 12:31 p.m. Singapore time, 2.55% higher than 24 hours previously, according to data from Coindesk.

Bitcoin last crossed $10,000 on June 3 and has since seen a steady decline. But over the last 7 days, Bitcoin has risen nearly 11%.

Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC that large players were debating whether to sell off their bitcoin to smaller entrants in the market which could push the price lower and make it more attractive for the bigger traders to buy more of the digital asset.

""This doesn't seem to have happened,"" Ayyar said. ""What we have unfolding is potentially re-accumulation by big players, joined by smaller traders in an attempt to push BTC higher past 10K and more past 10.5K, which is the big resistance level, where BTC last put in a high.""

""We still haven't broken the 10.5K level, if that happens, BTC is probably running to 15K. All signs point to that at this point,"" he added.

While bitcoin was higher last week, major Wall Street indices including the S&P 500 were lower. Gold, however, continued to rise and hit a record high on Monday. Gold is seen as a so-called safe-haven asset that investors buy in times of uncertainty.

Once we have hundreds of our 10s of thousands of shareholders keeping their wallets open, the blockchain becomes exceptionally secure.

Bots, Inc. and First Bitcoin Capital are working closely together to ensure a seamless transition of this major asset consisting of billions of BITs. Once the name of BIT is changed to Basic Income Token, Bots Inc. intends to distribute 1 BIT for each share of Bots Inc. to be held on a record date to be set for distribution as soon as August 30, 2020.

This asset is only one cryptocurrency of a larger inventory of more than 100 unique digital cryptocurrencies acquired from and previously owned by First Bitcoin Capital Corp. The most significant of the transferences of these cryptocurrencies to Bots Inc., included, but was not limited to, the majority ownership of First Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency based on a unique blockchain similar to an improved version of Litecoin.

Additionally BOTS, Inc. in conjunction with First Bitcoin Capital has generated managed units of a newly minted cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin’s blockchain utilizing the Omni protocols also used by Tether (COIN:USDT) in an effort to alternatively fulfill Yang’s vision, defined as follows:

“Universal Basic Income commemorates the presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s plan for distributing $1000 per month per citizen so that each world citizen is entitled to 1000 UBI per month upon request from Bots, Inc.”

“Those whom request this monthly UBI distribution will be required to cover Bots’ nominal Bitcoin transference costs and both Bots and First Bitcoin Capital will share in a 1% transference fee to be earned in kind. We will develop unique bots that will handle the inclusion of each requesting world- citizen wishing to use our automation in order to handle the sign ups and transfers” stated newly elected Company Chairman, Simon Rubin.

That's Silvergate Bank CEO Alan Lane, who believes the future is bright amid a strong second quarter he spoke to during an earnings call on Monday.

Indeed, the crypto banking scene has revved up considerably in the span of a few months, with major acquisitions and raises tied to the race to build out crypto's first full prime broker. While some announcements could have had the potential to take a piece out of Silvergate's pie, it seems growth in the industry has translated to continued growth for the bank.

For example, the digital asset-focused bank saw a 35% increase in digital currency industry customers from last year, to now more than 880 clients. On June 30, 2020, Silvergate had over 200 prospective digital currency customer leads in various stages of the customer onboarding process and pipeline.

Digital currency-related fee income also reached $2.4 million, a 40% jump since last quarter. It's also a 120% increase from this time last year.

The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the bank's 24/7 transfer network for digital currency firms, also processed 30% more dollar-value transactions compared to last quarter, reaching $22.4 billion. That's a 160% increase from the previous year.

Lane said the bank is ""bullish"" on its payments platform, particularly with the release of its loan funding and repayment processing product SEN Leverage.

""The response to our newest product offering SEN leverage has been very positive and we will continue to grow our Bitcoin collateralized loans through the second half of the year,"" said Lane. ""We also see many opportunities to further enhance the value of our global payments platform and we'll continue to invest in new product development to drive innovation.""

The company reported that SEN Leverage saw bitcoin collateralized loans grow to $22.5 million in approved credit in the quarter, almost double the size in the first quarter.

Lane has headed Silvergate for two decades. In that time, he said, the firm has shared views with regulators on the legal permissibility for a bank to provide custody of digital assets.

Now, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has formalized that view, allowing federal savings associations and national savings banks to custody crypto. Lane said the timing of the announcement was more surprising than the announcement itself.

""In fact, if a bank was not permitted to provide custody services that would really call into question our ability to provide lending services to begin with because one of the things that we've touched on for the last couple of years is that in order for us to safely land against this asset we absolutely have to have the ability to custody it, whether we're custodying the asset ourselves or doing that through a third party service provider such as we are with SEN Leverage,"" said Lane.

In Silvergate's home state of California, Lane said regulators have been on board with the concept for ""quite some time as it relates to our ability to custody the digital assets for purposes of securing the collateral for lending,"" specifically pointing to California's Department of Business Oversight and the San Francisco Federal Reserve.

The OCC's announcement opens the door for traditional banks that have been dipping their toes into the digital asset space to further expand their reach. JPMorgan Chase has dabbled in blockchain and crypto projects, and now the OCC has given the giant the green light to custody. However, Silvergate isn't worried about getting edged out by bigger players.

In fact, Lane said the bank views JPMorgan's steps as ""a huge positive for the space."" Silvergate didn't take any hits in its second quarter in the wake of the OCC announcement, and is taking J Morgan's steps into crypto as a sign of maturity of the ecosystem. Furthermore, Lane said he's finding exchange clients are looking to develop multiple banking relationships, meaning it's unlikely Silvergate would lose its seat at the table.



Still, as JPMorgan becomes a service point for crypto exchange Gemini, Silvergate is assessing where it hopes to expand in the space as well.

Prime brokerage has become an attractive opportunity for many in the crypto industry, but Lane said that, in contrast to the traditional finance world, the digital asset space is still determining what a true prime broker looks like — thus leaving room for experimentation and growth.

""Our approach to the prime brokerage solution, if you will, has been to focus on that key component of providing leverage,"" said Lane.

In terms of finding the best fit for customers, the bank is considering a ""development of the products, strategic partnerships, and potential acquisitions of existing infrastructure providers,"" according to the call.",,,,

“Bitcoin has pushed decisively through not only psychological resistance of $10,000 but also a key level near $10,055,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairlead Strategies. However, she is skeptical the price can stay over $11,000.

“There are some signs of upside exhaustion on this push higher, so we would be sure to await confirmation of the breakout before adding exposure to bitcoin. This would occur on consecutive weekly closes above $10,055,” she added.

“The Fear and Greed Index is in the ‘extreme greed’ zone, moving towards the overbought level,” noted Konstatine Kogan of cryptocurrency fund of funds BitBull Capital. “The first support is located at the level of $10,000. If bitcoin falls below this mark, then there is a possibility of a subsequent decline,” he added.

Not all stakeholders are suspicious of the bitcoin market’s price run-up. One positive for traders is that volatility is making a comeback, according to data from aggregator CryptoCompare.

“Historical bitcoin volatility has bounced from its lowest point since March 2019,” said James Li, research analyst for CryptoCompare. “The question is whether this is just a temporary bounce or are we heading back to a historical, more volatile BTC market,” he added.

Ethereum dominance hits 2020 high

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Tuesday, trading around $318 after slipping 1.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The dominance of ether in the cryptocurrency market crossed 12% Monday, its highest point in 2020, according to data calculated by real-time charting firm TradingView. Dominance, or the market cap as a percentage of the entire cryptosphere, is a measure traders use to quickly get a sense of a cryptocurrency’s importance relative to the broader digital currency market. Although ether’s dominance has dipped below 12% Tuesday, it’s still higher than it has been all year; the last time ether hit 12% dominance was back in May 2019.

“DeFi users can access that market using stablecoins. But clearly the main core asset fueling the DeFi run is still ether, hence its recent dominance,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for Tellurian Capital, which has been investing in crypto projects since 2014.“The recent development and ramping up of new and better DeFi applications such as Compound, Aave and Balancer is clearly generating more traction for Ethereum,” he added.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, started the week close to $240 and steadily moved up to its current $330 price tag, breaking a longstanding resistance at the $250 mark to hit a 13-month high.3

Year-to-date bitcoin has been outperforming gold, even though the precious metal is now close to a new all-time high. In the last 30 days, BTC went up 11%, while Ethereum is up 40%.

This week headlines have been pointing to a potential cryptocurrency service PayPal is set to soon announce. According to CoinDesk, people familiar with PayPal’s upcoming crypto offering have revealed the fintech giant partnered with Paxos Crypto Brokerage to start letting some of its over 300 million users buy and sell crypto through both PayPal and Venmo.

Which cryptocurrencies PayPal will let its users buy and sell is not clear. Paxos holds a New York state trust charter and is a qualified custodian, legally allowing it to hold gold and cryptoassets such as bitcoin and ether on behalf of institutional clients. It handles regulatory compliance while letting clients offer cryptos to their users.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has this week started letting nationally chartered banks in the U.S. provide custody services for cryptocurrencies, according to a letter from Senior Deputy Comptroller and Senior Counsel Jonathan Gould.

The letter details any national bank can hold the private keys of a cryptocurrency wallet, which means banks can now hold cryptoassets on behalf of clients. It also notes these may offer “more secure storage services compared to existing options,” and could be a solution for investment advisors and consumers.

The document also reaffirmed banks may “provide permissible banking services to any lawful business they choose, including cryptocurrency businesses.” Banks that are to enter the crypto space, it adds, should develop and implement their custody services “with sound risk management practices.”

The price of bitcoin moving past the $10,000 mark came alongside another major milestone in the cryptocurrency space. Tether’s USDt stablecoin, the most prominent cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has seen its market cap surpass $10 billion. Its growth has cemented its position as the third-largest crypto by market cap, behind only BTC and ETH.

Web browser Opera has also revealed it expanded cryptocurrency wallet top-ups to the UK, allowing users to buy crypto directly from its built-in wallet without using an exchange. The browser has over 350 million monthly active users, but only 170,000 use its crypto wallet.

Fight Against Cryptocurrency Scams Intensifies

The hackers that managed to access Twitter’s internal tools and systems and used them to hijack dozens of high-profile accounts to promote a fake bitcoin giveaway have once again put cryptocurrency scams in the limelight.

The hackers made a total of $120,000 worth of bitcoin, but Coinbase revealed over the week it prevented users from sending $300,000 worth of BTC to the hackers by acting quickly and blacklisted the address they were asked the funds to be sent to. The hackers have been trying to launder the funds, and have already moved them to gambling and peer-to-peer platforms, but blockchain analytics firms are tracing the funds.

Google-owned video-sharing platform YouTube has been hit with a lawsuit from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who argued the platform has been failing to stop scammers from using his name and image in bitcoin giveaways similar to those promoted on Twitter.

The lawsuit argues, however, that while Twitter reacted quickly YouTube has been “unresponsive” to Wozniak’s repeated requests to take down fraudulent videos and promotions. It adds

YouTube has been unapologetically hosting, promoting, and directly profiting from similar scams.

YouTube has denied liability for the cryptocurrency scams, responding to another lawsuit filed by Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, on the grounds of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which serves to protect platform publishers from being liable for third parties.

The video-sharing giant argued that scam and impersonation channels represent content created by third parties, regardless of the platform’s “unwitting verification.”",2020-07-28 08:00:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-traders-discuss-bitcoin-price-direction-after-114k-btc-rally,"The price of Bitcoin officially surpassed $10,400 on July 27, breaking out of a multiyear range as a result. Traders are now mixed on where Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will go next, as many indicators and data points show conflicting trends.

The general sentiment around Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has been positive since April. The United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted banks permission to operate crypto custody services, institutional investors have continuously invested in Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies through Grayscale, and most recently, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin saw its largest inflow in eight months.

A confluence of strong fundamental factors related to regulation and infrastructure has seemingly improved the perception of Bitcoin by the mainstream. That has coincided with an increase in liquidity triggered by high Tether inflow and the recovery of futures market open interest. A rising inflow of Tether is an important metric due to it being the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. The numbers suggest that the demand for the stablecoin is increasing, indicating a growing appetite for crypto assets.

Some macro factors could have fueled the demand for Bitcoin in recent months. Since April, the U.S. dollar has been in decline relative to other major reserve currencies. Investors such as billionaire Ray Dalio have pointed at the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and China as the biggest factor. As the U.S. dollar has dropped, the price of gold has gone up. Historically, a weak dollar has caused the stock market to underperform, which would, in theory, boost gold. Given the recent price correlation between gold and Bitcoin, there is a chance that a weakening dollar will indirectly benefit BTC.

Based on market structure, traders expect the price of Bitcoin to range in the near term. BTC has broken out of a critical resistance level at $10,500. After such a powerful upward price movement, some stability would cool down the market. Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and a Cointelegraph contributor, said that Bitcoin could soon see a new range. Considering that $12,000 has acted as strong resistance in the past, van de Poppe suggested a $9,700–$12,000 range could materialize.

As Bitcoin saw an explosive upward price movement, trading volumes surged in tandem. According to Skew, July 27 was the second-highest volume day in the history of Bitcoin. As BTC comes off a record-setting rally, below is an overview of bullish and bearish scenarios that could impact price in the near term.

Bullish scenarios for Bitcoin in the short to medium term

Some traders and investors foresee a continuation of the ongoing Bitcoin rally. According to the cryptocurrency trader known as Ethereum Jack, BTC recently saw a clean breakout. It marked the fifth upsurge to a resistance level that has held up since September 2019. The trader emphasized that the price trend of Bitcoin could become overextended if the rally resumes, but he noted that it has all the characteristics of a prolonged uptrend:

“$BTC giving the cleanest breakout-retest setup I have seen in a very long time whilst each corrective wave since 4K has been vertical re-accumulation. This has all characteristics for a strongly extended fifth — aside from BTC generally loving extended fifths.”

Cryptocurrency trader Koroush AK said that Bitcoin currently has three bullish arguments. First, the 0.618 Fibonacci level measured in between $9,300 and $11,421 has to hold. The 0.618 level marks an important level in the Fibonacci retracement system, and it typically leads to a trend reversal when breached. Second, the $10,400 level acts as robust horizontal support. Third, as long as the $10,170 level is kept, the argument for a higher low is intact.

In simple terms, Koroush AK believes that if the price of Bitcoin stays above $10,170, $10,400 and $10,622, the price trend will remain bullish. The $10,170 level, or a higher low, is particularly critical in technical analysis, as it suggests a strong uptrend. A higher-low pattern forms when the most recent low point of an asset is higher than the previous low points.

Similarly, the Bitcoin trader known as Satoshi Flipper suggested that there is little resistance between $10,886 and $11,400. As BTC comes fresh off of a breakout above $11,000 for the first time since August 2019, traders seemingly anticipate volatility in the newfound range.

Apart from fundamentals, technology researcher Kevin Rook emphasized that the “HODLing” level of Bitcoin is at a record high. That metric indicates that many long-term holders of BTC are reluctant to sell the top cryptocurrency. It could show that BTC is currently in an accumulation phase, with Rook stating: “62% of Bitcoin supply (11,400,000 BTC) has not moved in at least a year. The speculators are gone, HODLing is at an all-time high.” The first major breakout in nearly 11 months, an increase in long-term BTC holders and a favorable market structure strengthen the bullish outlook on Bitcoin.

Bearish cases for BTC in the near term

In the near term, however, some traders expect a cool-off in the cryptocurrency market. Following a large Bitcoin price upsurge, various metrics suggest that the rally is overextended. The most prominent metric of all is likely the funding rate.

Bitcoin futures contracts without expiration dates are called perpetual swaps. They are the most utilized futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market, as they are less complex to trade. But the lack of expiration dates is balanced with a mechanism called funding, which forces long or short contract holders to pay their counterpart a fee once every eight hours, depending on market sentiment.

When the funding rate of Bitcoin perpetual swaps turns positive, it means the majority of the market is long on BTC’s price. For instance, BitMEX has shown a funding rate of around 0.077% for Bitcoin perpetual swaps in the last two days. That shows that the overwhelming majority of the market is longing BTC, leaving the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a potential long squeeze.

Some traders state that the funding rates of perpetual swaps are simply too high to be sustained. Referring to the funding rates, the cryptocurrency trader known as Byzantine General said, “This needs to cool off for a bit.”

In terms of market structure, Bitcoin technical analyst Crypto Capo said BTC could confirm its uptrend if it stays above $10,500 and establishes it as a clear level of support. But if BTC rejects in the short term and drops below the level, he said there is a chance of a UTAD forming. A UTAD, meaning “upthrust after distribution,” is a pattern that is a part of the Wyckoff Method. It forms when an asset demonstrates a fakeout and proceeds to pull back. Several traders believe that there is still a small chance that the entire uptrend of BTC is a fake rally. StockCharts describes a UTAD as:

“A UT or UTAD allows large interests to mislead the public about the future trend direction and, subsequently, sell additional shares at elevated prices to such break-out traders and investors before the markdown begins.”

Another well-known cryptocurrency trader known as CryptoWhale said that the sentiment around the Bitcoin market is too fearful. The trader noted that the BTC rally follows “months of red” and that the cryptocurrency will probably see a correction.

Overall, the market is seemingly divided between traders who believe the rally is overextended and those who see a continuation. There are viable reasons to support both arguments, as funding rates signal an overheated market and BTC’s stability above $10,500 indicates strong momentum.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-latest-rally-may-have-staying-power-exchange-flows-suggest,"Bitcoin is currently trading above $10,000, but is the latest move into five figures here to stay? Data suggests this rally might have legs.

The leading cryptocurrency has failed a number of times during the last 12 months to keep gains above the $10,000 mark. But this time may be different. Consider the flow of bitcoins and stablecoins in and out of cryptocurrency exchanges observed on Monday, suggesting the latest price breakout may persist.

The inflow of bitcoins into exchanges increased by 68,970 BTC to 130,039 BTC on Monday – the largest single-day rise in 134 days – as the cryptocurrency jumped over 10% to $11,315 to reach its highest level in nearly 12 months, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence firm.

In other words, as the cryptocurrency rallied to multi-month highs, some investors moved their coins to exchanges. Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when they lack confidence in the rally or resources to hold coins for long-term and want to liquidate their investments.

As such, one may argue that additional supply has poured into exchanges. While that seems to be the case, the buying pressure, as represented by the inflow of the largest stablecoin tether (USDT) into exchanges, has also strengthened.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg their market value to some external reference, usually the U.S. dollar. Tether and other major stablecoins are widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases and their market capitalization has grown enormously this year. Tether, the largest dollar-backed stablecoin, crossed a $10 billion market cap earlier this month.

Tether (USDT) exchange inflows Source: Chainalysis

Tether inflows surged by over 440 million USDT to 726 million USDT on Monday, as per Chainalysis. “There was $726 million worth of demand for bitcoin entering into exchanges yesterday to balance the $1.3 billion worth of bitcoin looking to sell,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Tuesday.

And while the inflow of tether was less than that of bitcoin, there are other means to buy cryptocurrencies. “There will also be demand from fiat,” Gradwell noted.

Thus flows suggests the buying pressure may be strong enough to absorb the extra supply that has come onto exchanges and bitcoin may finally succeed in establishing a strong foothold above $10,000.",2020-07-28 18:13:15+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-bites-bitcoins-new-etp-ethereums-woodstock-moment-and-silvergates-sen-zen,"A crypto hedge fund is folding, Silvergate Bank’s bitcoin-collateralized loans surged this quarter and bitcoin futures markets record triple-digit growth.

De-Funded

Cryptocurrency hedge fund Tetras Capital is shutting down and returning investors’ money after quarters of low returns, an anonymous source told CoinDesk. The New York-based fund, founded in 2017, recorded a 75% loss life-to-date. At its height, Tetras managed upwards of $33 million, according to financial filings, with an investment thesis centered around shorting ether and investing in alt-coins. At least 68 crypto hedge funds closed last year internationally, almost double the number – 35 – in 2018, according to a Crypto Fund Research report.

SEN’s Zen

Silvergate Bank continued to book new cryptocurrency customers in the second quarter while its portfolio of bitcoin-collateralized loans nearly doubled. According to its latest earnings report, the bank’s $1.1 billion traditional loans increased only 0.1% from the first quarter. Bitcoin-collateralized loans through the bank’s SEN Leverage product surged 88% in the same period, to $22.5 million.

Tracing Tools

LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer crypto exchange, has added two Elliptic blockchain-tracing tools, as it continues to become regulatory compliant. The Helsinki-based platform announced Tuesday it will use Elliptic’s Navigator risk analysis tool and Lens wallet screener to crack down on illicit crypto. The platform has been bolstering its anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards in response to the European Union’s AMLD5 and new Finnish business regulations. Recently, LocalBitcoins has suspended cash-for-crypto trading and added mandatory identity verification.

Sustainable Investments

Fasset, a fintech company headquartered in the U.K., has launched an Ethereum-based operating system dedicated to the ethical financing of sustainable infrastructure. The system tokenizes investments made in sustainable infrastructure – like solar power plants, wind farms and fiber optic – and makes them tradable among global investors. By moving the entire financing process to the blockchain, the firm intends to improve liquidity in the sustainable infrastructure sector and lower barriers to entry that will enable asset owners to avoid costly middlemen and directly list their assets on exchanges.

At stake

CoinDesk’s Ian Allison recounts memories from the first Devcon, a gathering of Ethereans and other tech developers plotting the future of everything from finance to the internet. This excerpt is part of a series of stories, live-streamed conferences and a limited-run pop-up newsletter CoinDesk has created to celebrate Ethereum’s five year anniversary this week.

Ethereum’s Devcon 1, held in London in November 2015, was like Woodstock, except perhaps with less nudity.

Bankers and Big 4 consultants disguised in hoodies shared space with dreadlocked Ethereum coders, sitting cross-legged in the corners, their laptops open in front of them.

Packed into a Victorian banking hall in the heart of the City of London, the audience listened as ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin predicted a new future for firms; cryptographer Nick Szabo talked about decentralization in the context of Francis Drake and the Aztecs; and chief scientist Vitalik Buterin assembled shards of the path that lay ahead.

“The internet kind of sucks,” said Ethereum wallet designer Alex Van de Sande during his opening keynote. “It’s centralized, and it’s broken – but we can fix it this week.”

Such was the optimism in the room.

Keeping with the Woodstock motif, this moment in time possessed a kind of prelapsarian innocence: The DAO debacle and hard fork decision that followed was at least six months away, and further off still was the ICO gold rush.

An earlier confab, Berlin’s Devcon 0, preceded Ethereum’s launch. In London, things were starting to get real.

Bitcoin’s Bounce

Bitcoin’s futures trading volume recorded triple-digit growth Monday, as institutions and investors raced into a market primed for a bull run. Aggregate daily futures volume on major exchanges reached $43 billion, the highest single-day volume since March 13, according to data source Skew. Daily trading volume on institutional exchange CME rose 570% to a yearly high of $1.32 billion, Bakkt registered a record volume of $132 million and total open interest for all exchanges rose to $5 billion – the highest since February.

Yearly Highs: Bitcoin & Gold

Bitcoin’s 13% price jump to 2020 highs of $11,180 on Monday came as the dollar’s value slides. This move was in tandem with gold’s newly set all-time high, both of which are referred to as inflation hedges. Bitcoin is up 57% year to date, more than double the 28% gain this year for gold, while the S&P is flat for the year. “Given gold has just set a new all-time high, and with bitcoin’s correlation to stocks breaking down while being replaced by a strong correlation to gold, we envisage further tests to the upside this coming week,” Diginex wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index, a gauge of the greenback’s value versus other major currencies, has fallen for seven straight sessions. A weakening dollar “mechanically pushes up the prices of the commodities invoiced in greenbacks,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Launchpad Before Launch

Ethereum developers have released a “validator launchpad” on the Medalla testnet to educate and prepare future validators as part of a multi-stage roll out of Ethereum 2.0. The transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the core component of Eth 2, is designed to improve the system’s scalability. According to an announcement, three phases of the roll out are planned, with the first, phase 0, focusing on the underlying tech behind staking by tracking validators and their balances. The launchpad, which comes before phase 0, will enable validators to track and deposit test stakes on the upcoming Medalla multi-client testnet.

Millennial Moves

Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis, thinks millennials are shaping the future of money. From fashion to tech, a millennial “desire for autonomy and granular choice” is now extending to finance. “For most of the past hundred years, retail finance was dominated by a small number of regional, and later national, institutions. No more: 71% of millennials would change banks based on the quality of an app, and a full third of us say we won’t need a bank at all in the future,” he writes.

That includes bitcoin, which shot up some 13% on Monday for its biggest gain in almost three months. Prices soared past levels reached in February, prior to the pandemic-induced sell-off, reaching a new 2020 high of $11,180.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, told First Mover in an email that the latest move up appeared “in sync” with gold’s climb in recent days to a new record. Bitcoin is seen by many digital-asset analysts as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, similar to the way investors in traditional markets have historically used gold.

“Bitcoin sprung into action,” DiPasquale said.

It’s a remarkable development in the bitcoin market, where investors, as recently as last week, were despairing that the oldest and largest cryptocurrency had been stuck in a range between $9,000 and $10,000 for the past two months.

So for bitcoin bulls, the jolt out of the doldrums was welcome, especially when the price went up, not down. The day’s gain came on strong trading volume, with levels not seen since early June.

“The trend is clear and we are headed higher,” said Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative trading firm Kronos Research.

Bitcoin is now up 57% year to date, more than double the 28% gain this year for gold, which climbed in recent days to a record. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, meanwhile, is roughly flat for the year.

“Given gold has just set a new all-time high, and with bitcoin’s correlation to stocks breaking down while being replaced by a strong correlation to gold, we envisage further tests to the upside this coming week,” the cryptocurrency-trading firm Diginex wrote in a daily market report.

The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, a gauge of the greenback’s value versus other major currencies like the euro and yen, has fallen for seven straight sessions; the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs predicts the dollar could lose another 5% over the next 12 months.

“The U.S. dollar is eroding quickly, and people are starting to notice,” wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange research firm Quantum Economics, in his daily email. “It’s plain to see that people are ditching the buck as fast as they can.”

That’s good for bitcoin and gold: As the Wall Street Journal put it Monday, a weakening dollar “mechanically pushes up the prices of the commodities invoiced in greenbacks.”

Investors appear worried the global economic recovery is faltering, with cases on the rise and a death toll globally that just passed 650,000. In the U.S. Congress, Senate Republicans proposed a $1 trillion relief package following negotiations with President Donald Trump, but that amount falls far short of a Democrat-led plan for $3.5 trillion in stimulus.

Jim Reid, strategist for the German lender Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report that the Federal Reserve, which has already expanded its balance sheet this year by about $3 trillion to about $7 trillion, might need to pump another $12 trillion over the next few years.

The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet this week in closed-door discussions, with a statement due late Wednesday. With interest rates already close to zero, no major policy changes are expected, but the cryptocurrency investment fund Arca noted Monday that a sell-off in the U.S. stock market might provoke the U.S. central bank to respond.

A report on Thursday is expected to show that U.S. gross domestic product declined during the second quarter by a staggering 35% on an annualized basis.

With so much fragility in the economy, and things not improving quickly, “the moral hazard is now so high that the stock market barely even has to blink,” Arca wrote.

For bitcoin, according to Arca, “the breakout was just a matter of time.”

Bitcoin watch

BTC: Price: $10,773 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,395 | 24-Hr Low: $10,215

Trend: Bitcoin is witnessing a low-volume technical pullback on Tuesday.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $10,850 – down over 4% from the 11-month high of $11,394 reached on Monday.

The drop in price suggests bitcoin may be overvalued. The 14-day relative strength index jumped to 82 as prices surged 11% on Monday. An above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions – meaning excessive demand has pushed prices unjustifiably high.

The pullback may be extended further, as the 14-day RSI is still hovering above 70. In addition, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped into bearish territory below 50. That said, the bullish bias might be invalidated if prices finish below $10,500 (the February high) at the UTC market close.

That looks unlikely, as the decline from multi-month highs observed so far today is accompanied by a slide in trading volumes (above right). A low-volume pullback is often short-lived.

Besides, some analysts are convinced that Monday’s bullish move has put bitcoin on the path toward record highs. “[Monday’s] daily close is amazing and could very well resemble April 2019’s $1k candle that ended the bear market and fueled a rally to $13,000. Only this time, the rally should lead to new all-time-high for BTC,” popular analyst Josh Rager tweeted early Tuesday.",2020-07-28 11:27:27+00:00,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-rally-market-action-crypto-bulls-want-oppenheimer-analyst-2020-7,"Reuters

Bitcoin's latest upswing suggests the cryptocurrency on the verge of a new uptrend, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said Monday.

The digital token rallied to its highest level in nearly a year in late Monday trading and held the $11,000 level into Tuesday morning.

While gold is likely the most popular hedge bet for those expecting inflation to rise, bitcoin ""isn't as extended,"" Wald said on CNBC.

The coin is slowly reversing a years-long downtrend and is displaying ""the type of action"" a crypto bull would like to see, the analyst added.

Bitcoin's long-term trendline suggests it has plenty of room to run, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said Monday.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency soared to its highest level in nearly a year late Monday evening and stayed above $11,000 per coin into Tuesday morning as investors continued rotations to hedge plays.

Gold, another alternative asset to soar through recent sessions, is a good way to position for the Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary easing, Wald said. Yet major cryptocurrencies could serve as a more tactical bet against inflation and low yields, he noted.

""I think it's worthwhile to highlight bitcoin instead, which isn't as extended,"" Wald said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" adding that the token's volatility makes it ""tough"" to shrink trading losses and maintain flexibility for long-term strategies.

Getting in early could benefit bitcoin bulls for years to come, Wald noted. The coin's price is steadily reversing a downtrend that began after reaching its peak in 2017, and bitcoin's latest swings point to plenty of upside to come, he added.

""If you are a long-term holder, this is the type of action you'd like to see,"" the analyst said.

Bitcoin traded at $10,992.30 per coin as of 4:15 p.m. ET, up 52% year-to-date.

NOW WATCH: Why YETI coolers are so expensive",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cellebrite-launches-crypto-tracer-solution-to-track-illicit-transactions,"Digital intelligence firm Cellebrite has launched its “Cellebrite Crypto Tracer” solution.

The new offering is powered by CipherTrace and aims to trace illicit cryptocurrencies involved in money laundering, terrorism, drugs, human trafficking, weapon sales and ransomware schemes.

The suite of tools will be available to investigators, analysts and non-technical agents who want to lawfully obtain evidence and trace criminals who use cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) through the darknet.

Citing figures from an Oxford University study, Cellebrite states that an estimated $76 billion worth of illegal activities involve Bitcoin.

Curating millions of information references to trace transactions

The Cellebrite Crypto Tracer Solution allows investigators to aggregate and curate millions of open-source and private references, deception data, and human intelligence, resulting in a dataset of over 522 million attributable points.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Leeor Ben-Peretz, chief strategy officer of Cellebrite, states that Cellebrite Crypto Tracer is able to attribute millions of data points, such as account type, account holders, contract types, contract owners and other metadata. It can also pinpoint where the illicit funds were headed, whether that be a wallet or an exchange.

Ben-Peretz said, “Some of the major features of the solution include the ability to conduct risk scoring and profile hundreds of global exchanges, ATMs, mixers, money laundering systems, gambling services, and known criminal addresses and assign risk levels to transactions.""

The ongoing fight against illicit crypto transactions

John Jefferies, chief financial analyst of CipherTrace, predicts that, as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream and accepted by traditional financial institutions, criminals will also adopt them more widely, making for a ""continued and escalating game of cat and mouse.""

""As the market capitalization of crypto grows, larger financial crimes and nation-state scale. Regulatory reform, driven by the updated FATF guidelines, will force jurisdiction arbitrage as new laws are enacted, globally on unsynchronized timelines,” he added.

Jefferies addressed to the recent Twitter hack incident, stating that he believes the situation could have been “much worse and shows that the blockchain community is wising up to the scammers.”

“When cryptocurrencies first emerged, law enforcement agencies had very little understanding about how cryptocurrencies work and that the transactions can be traced on the public ledgers. The situation is much different today. We are working closely with law enforcement agencies on the recent Twitter hacking bitcoin scam, for example,” he concluded.",,,,

People are depositing BTC into the exchanges and withdrawing ETH, indicating an increased demand for buying ETH.

Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance has been weakening ever since the halving.

Alt season, where smaller coins are on the rise, is among us once again—even if somewhat contained.

Since July, 20, crypto exchange CEX.IO has reported a spike in pairings for Ethereum (ETH). Back in June, ETH pairings amounted to just under half of the volume, with the Bitcoin/US dollar pairing making up the lion’s share of the transactions, or 40% of the exchange’s entire volume.

But after the rise of DeFi, or decentralized finance—non-custodial financial products—which this month added $2 million to its market cap in about two weeks, Bitcoin is no longer top dog. In the past few days, Bitcoin amounted to just 20% of transactions on CEX.IO, meaning it’s decreased by 50%.

Trading for other pairings, on the other hand, boomed, forming 80% of transactions in the past week. ETH pairings alone increased by three times on the exchange. “It is safe to say that ETH is now the driver of the cryptocurrency market growth,” said Dmytro Volkov, CTO of CEX.IO.

Ethereum has received a boost in attention, and to its price, as a result of the DeFi boom of 2020. The top DeFi protocols, Compound, Maker and Aave, live on Ethereum. And their associated Ethereum-based tokens have taken off in recent months ever since the introduction of ""yield farming,"" where lending protocols use platform-specific incentives to ratchet up profits.

On CEX, Volkov said that the “balance of BTC and ETH deposits and withdrawals [...] has been preserved."" He's noticed, however, that people are plugging BTC into the exchange and withdrawing ETH. “This indicates either an increased demand for buying ETH or active crypto arbitrage strategies of traders,” he said.

CEX is just a small exchange. According to CoinGecko, it trades around $30 million each day. By comparison, the market leader by volume, Binance, trades about $5 billion. It’s worth noting, however, that CEX is just one of 13 crypto exchanges that analytics firm Coin Metrics included just yesterday in its list of trustworthy trading platforms in terms of volume data.

And the same story is playing out elsewhere. According to data from metrics site CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance has been dwindling ever since May, about the time of the halving, when the block reward cut in two.

Back then, Bitcoin accounted for around 67% of the entire crypto market cap while Ethereum accounted for 8.67%. Now, Bitcoin makes up about 61-62% of crypto’s market cap, while Ethereum accounts for 11%.

The ETH spike has whacked an additional $60 billion onto the crypto market cap since the start of the month. The entire crypto market cap is now $328 billion, far higher than it was in February, the month prior to the COVID-inspired crash.

Still, the crypto market cap is a fraction of what it was at the 2017 boom, around $830 billion.

Just one week ago, bitcoin’s price hit an intraday high of $9,568 in a low-volume environment. This week’s action, fueled by increased exchange volumes, has traders excited at the thought a long-term bull market may be back. As much as $446 million in trades were done on Coinbase Monday.

Some analysts say the move to $11,000 is just the start of the world’s oldest currency continuing on a price tear upward. “We do not see the move to $11,000 as significant and we are anticipating far higher valuations,” said George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital.

Clayton noted the European Union passed a €570 billion stimulus measure, and a U.S. package in the works that could provide $1 trillion in new spending should an agreement between President Trump and Congress be reached. “These actions amount to rampant fiat currency debasement. The move in crypto is just beginning,” he added.

The crypto derivatives market is heating up again too, Shah added. “What’s most interesting to me is that CME volumes have been very strong the last two days.” Indeed, CME options volume has picked up significantly during a July that had previously been bereft of action; open interest is now well over $250 million.

At the start of July, the total user count on the Balancer exchange was 7,184, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics. The number has swelled 140%, to 17,438 since then for the Ethereum-based DeFi project. “Balancer made an excellent product that allows you to create your own ETF and not pay a rebalancing commission and actually receive commissions for trading,” said Azamat Malaev, co-founder of HodlTree, a new DeFi protocol for interest-yielding tokens.

Malaev also noted Balancer’s BAL token distribution and staking returns as another factor contributing to July’s growth, even though the token’s performance slipped 25% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko. “Balancer uses the Compound model in distributing their tokens. Now the percentages are lower, about 30% per annum, but also very attractive.”

Five years ago, Bitcoin, the seminal cryptocurrency, was valued at approximately $275.00 (a staggering 2,749,900% return on investment for those who obtained it for less than a penny in 2010), but very few accepted it as a method of payment. In fact, the first person to buy a pizza with Bitcoin, a Florida programmer, had to route his transaction through England.

Bitcoin (BTC) captured the public’s attention when its value neared $20,000.00 in December 2017, taking other crypto-currencies along for the ride up . . . and then down as Bitcoin sunk below $3,500.00 one year later. The high valuations encouraged the creation of speculative “altcoins” (alternatives to Bitcoin) sold to investors in “ICOs” (initial coin offerings) until the Securities Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission took an increased interest, thus tamping down the euphoria. Today, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies; but the top 10 represent approximately 85% of the crypto market, and Bitcoin aka “crypto gold” dominates the field. Bitcoin’s market cap of $175+ billion is more than double that of all other cryptocurrencies combined.

Franchise Unit and System owners can therefore appreciate the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as an investment, even if the Chairman of the SEC famously refused to call it a “security” in 2018. But what about the value of Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, a medium of exchange?

For many, Bitcoin’s volatility precludes its use as a means of payment. (Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin, has stayed relatively stable since May, hovering between $9,000 and $10,000.) “Stablecoins”, cryptocurrencies backed by a reserve asset or basket of assets, have risen as an answer to the stability issue. The most used stablecoin is currently Tether (USDT), a stablecoin tied to the U.S. Dollar, which now exceeds Bitcoin in daily volume.

Tether is a centralized cryptocurrency (not an oxymoron) run by a private company, Tether Limited. While there are different Tether coins, the chief one is USDT, tied to the U.S. Dollar. Tether maintains that every USDT is backed by the equivalent of $1 in reserves of traditional currency or other cash equivalents. Perhaps Tether cannot be trusted to maintain the ratio any more than a bank, but it is the chief way to exchange digital “dollars” until the U.S. adopts a digital dollar . . .

Which may be coming very soon. Committees in Congress (e.g. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy and the House Financial Services Committee ) have begun talking seriously in hearings about the benefits of digitizing the U.S. Dollar. Perhaps buzz has been spurred by the nascent Digital Dollar Project, a think tank, which released a white paper earlier this year.

Meanwhile, in a major development this week the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency wrote in a public letter that nationally chartered banks in the U.S. could provide “cryptocurrency custody services, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency,” which may extend beyond passively holding cryptocurrency keys. This provides an alternative from existing ways to “hold” cryptocurrency; you can now entrust a nationally chartered bank to “hold” your cryptocurrency as opposed to holding it on a cold (offline) or hot (online) wallet.

The future will likely see increased adoption of currencies secured by cryptography, with one or a select few of them going mainstream. Savvy business owners should begin learning about this topic now, if they haven’t already.

Data analytics firms recalibrated their exchange ranking metrics, and some assumed it was just a matter of time before wash trading was curtailed if not eliminated.

But wash trading was back in the news last week when the CEO, president and chief operating officer of Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare were all forced to step down after Ontario securities regulators accused the company of inflating trading volume to the tune of $5.5 billion.

Wash trading involves transactions in which no funds or financial interests are actually exchanged. They are sometimes referred to as “false trades” and are used to bolster an exchange’s reported trade volume. This, in turn, gives the appearance of liquidity and market activity, attracting new users to the exchange. In traditional finance where exchanges are regulated, trade volume is a good proxy for liquidity — but not in the crypto world.

A serious problem

Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto ratings platform CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph: “This problem is still prevalent. We still see non-regulated exchanges conducting wash trading, and we don’t have a good measure to tell whether it is getting better or worse over time.”

Meanwhile, John Jefferies, chief financial analyst at crypto forensics firm CipherTrace, informed Cointelegraph: “The Bitwise letter to the SEC was a turning point because it informed investors and regulators on how pervasive wash trading was at that time.” But it didn’t stamp out the practice. “This form of market manipulation is still a serious problem, especially in the 800 exchanges that are not in the Top 40.”

Bitwise’s chief technology officer, Hong Kim, told Cointelegraph that he has seen no uptick in wash trading lately, and since Bitwise made its presentation to the SEC in an attempt to win approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, “enormous progress has been sustained” in dealing with the problem of fake trading numbers — but more work still needs to be done.

Wash trading has even been reported recently on decentralized exchanges, which seems like an anomaly because each trade is recorded on a public ledger and fake trading may be easily detected. It seems that the practice may sometimes take place on Binance DEX and Loopring, showcasing that DEXs can also be affected.

It’s difficult to determine the exact amount of fake volume that exists because data aggregators receive data from the same exchange APIs where wash trades and legitimate trading volumes are indistinguishable, Gerald Chee, head of research at CoinMarketCap, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Simply put, there is no easy way to tell if an exchange is inflating volumes or not by merely looking at the volumes they report. The only way to truly detect ’wash trades’ would require access to ’account-ID’ data — the actual accounts that performed the trade — and this data is extremely sensitive; only exchanges have access to this.”

Users suffer from false reporting

Wash trading is sometimes characterized as a victimless crime, but the practice can mislead investors. Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, told Cointelegraph: “Ultimately it is the consumer who is harmed by it as it is a false representation of depth in the market.”

Investors often feel more comfortable trading on a larger exchange, and the trading volume on a platform “is a factor that a reasonable investor would consider relevant in deciding whether to enter into or maintain a trading relationship,” noted the Ontario Securities Commission in its “statement of allegations” against Coinsquare.

Trading in these markets is a zero-sum game, added Jefferies. “Some unlucky speculator is going to lose the money that the market manipulators gain.” Moreover, Jefferies believes that “the industry as a whole suffers from lack of trust,” which impedes crypto’s growth into a major asset class, given concerns about market manipulation. No crypto-based ETF application has won SEC approval, and wash trading may be partly to blame for that, he suggested.

Wash trading is most prevalent among smaller, newer exchanges looking for a way “to trick new users who may not know who are the most reputable exchanges into opening an account with them,” said Ong, but often at unfavorable rates with high slippage. These exchanges are more likely to be hacked, too, because they often lack the resources to invest in the best cybersecurity practices.

Fake volume is generally created in two ways, explained Kim. Exchanges can be directly involved, just printing numbers or paying someone to trade. But perhaps more common, an exchange can create incentives for users to trade with themselves. The exchange could create a “no fee” top tier for users who trade more than $1 million in a year, for instance. Traders who want to maintain their no-fee top-tier status can do this simply by trading with themselves — at no cost. “The exchange doesn’t have to intentionally create fake volume,” said Kim.

Progress made since 2019

Still, some headway has been made since “Bitwise’s herculean study into trading volume manipulation helped pierce the veil on legitimate vs. spoofed order books,” wrote Messari CEO Ryan Selkis in a May blog. For example, the Bitwise report further encouraged Messari to develop a new set of trading volume metrics — its “Real 10 Volumes” — based on 10 exchanges it believed to have reported “legitimate” crypto trading volumes via their APIs.

Other ratings firms made adjustments in their exchange rankings, including CoinMarketCap, which Bitwise called out specifically by name in its 2019 report, stating: ""Despite its widespread use, the CoinMarketCap.com data is wrong [...] giving a fundamentally mistaken impression of the true size and nature of the bitcoin Market.”

Chee told Cointelegraph that “we do not disagree with the findings of Bitwise. We still think a large proportion of volumes are not organic in nature,” although he was reluctant to put an actual figure on false reporting, given the lack of objective data. But when CoinMarkeCap unveiled a new exchange ranking methodology that shifted from volumes to a mixed system of web traffic, liquidity and volumes, it saw a more than 50% drop in the globally reported volumes of exchanges. In 10-plus exchanges, the reduction in reported trading volume exceeded 90%. “This is indicative of prior wash trading, as exchanges are no longer incentivized to inflate volumes,” explained Chee.

When CryptoCompare revamped its crypto exchange benchmark, it gave considerable weight to jurisdiction — i.e., if the exchange is domiciled in a regulated environment. A regulated jurisdiction suggests the exchange is going to do things by the book, Hayter told Cointelegraph. Other factors such as website traffic — used by CoinMarketCap and others — are less useful in determining the authenticity of trading volume, according to Hayter, who went on to add:

“Website traffic, although sometimes useful for gauging popularity, is not really accurate — as lots of exchanges trade via API which will not be accurately represented. Coupled with that exchanges with high web traffic tend to be using populist promotions which in the long run tend to be empty promises.”

A regulatory divide?

Some view wash trading as a problem caused by having so many unregulated exchanges, as they “have a much higher instance of wash trading,” said Jefferies. “Until recently this included Canada, where Coinsquare was accused of wash trading 590,000 BTC, and the CEO, President, and the COO were forced out.” CoinGecko’s Ong told Cointelegraph:

“Unfortunately, many of the unregulated exchanges, especially those coming from China, are heavily wash trading and faking their volume. They have trading bots running to boost volume to appear larger and more liquid than what they actually are.”

This is apparent from situations where the bid-ask spreads are huge — more than 50% — but trades of more than $100 million are still reportedly taking place between the bid-ask spread, Ong added. “We have also seen exchange websites going down but API still spewing high trading volume data.” By contrast, exchanges in regulated jurisdictions are not facing these issues. Chee agreed: “Jurisdictions like the USA, Europe, Gibraltar, Japan, among others, generally have licensed exchanges that are more compliant to laws against market malpractice,” including wash trading.

Asked if having a regulated jurisdiction matters when it comes to eliminating false volume reporting, Kim answered that it matters 100%. In an unregulated jurisdiction, there is no penalty for claiming to have $1 trillion in trading volume when, in fact, there is only $1 million.

What about exchanges with “some” inflated volume?

Ratings firms have been reluctant to eliminate all non-regulated exchanges from their rankings, however. When Messari went with only the top 10 “clean” exchanges, it found that it eliminated a large part of the market. Specifically, it removed exchanges with some inflated volume but also legitimate trading volume — companies such as Bithumb, Upbit and Coinone in South Korea; Liquid in Japan; and Huobi, OKEx, OKCoin and Gate.io in China, said Selkis.

Messari eventually added 10 more exchanges to its ""real volume” metric, but it applied a 50% “haircut” to those gray-volume Korean and Chinese exchanges to better approximate their true volumes. According to Selkis, “We believe this better reflects the magnitude of adjustment necessary vs. simple web traffic comparisons, which usually discount these volumes by approximately 90%.”

Bitwise’s Kim, however, is wary about discounting — i.e., applying “haircuts” to — exchanges with inflated trading volume. In an unregulated jurisdiction, an exchange can report anything it wants with impunity. It can create a trading volume number out of thin air. Applying a 50% haircut to this number could still leave the exchange with $1 trillion in reported trading. So, the exchange’s “big lie” strategy remains alive and well.

On the other hand, if exchanges offered proof of reserves, “Wash trading would go away altogether,” said Kim. Kraken and a few others have done something like this. “It’s a doable thing, but the community isn’t demanding it.”

Marketing surveillance tools can help

Global regulation may be the long-term answer, but in the medium term, market surveillance and virtual asset service providers giving transparency can help curtail wash trading, said Jefferies. Kim agreed that exchanges, even in non-regulated jurisdictions, can make use of market surveillance tools if they are serious about curbing wash trading.

In the interim, rating firms and others will have to continue to look beyond trading volumes as the sole metric in determining an exchange’s quality. “We will need to look at more metrics to get a more holistic view of the exchange,” said Ong, whose firm has added factors such as order-book depth, bid-ask spread, web traffic estimates, API quality and cybersecurity practices to its “Trust Score” rating algorithm.

In sum, the problem of wash trading is not likely to be remedied overnight. This market malpractice is a “regulatory problem and not a data-related problem,” as Chee told Cointelegraph, but the market is decentralized and most exchanges exist outside a regulator’s reach, so moral suasion and community pressure can only work up to a point. In the end, a regulator’s stick — as recently seen in Canada — may be the only way to totally eliminate wash trading. “If you fear your right to operate will be imperiled, you won’t lie about trading volume,” said Kim.",,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-stopping-cryptocurrency-from-reaching-the-retail-economy-2020-07-29,"By Josh Tate, CEO of ForumPay

One-third of traditional financial institutions have invested in digital assets or derivatives, according to a Fidelity survey. Yet cryptocurrency still hasn’t achieved mainstream adoption. Volatility is often blamed as the primary culprit and is certainly a barrier, but the solution to that barrier might be easier than people think. In order for cryptocurrency to become stable and scale, it must first become an acceptable payment method across the board. Universality is one of cryptocurrency’s greatest attributes, but acceptability, ironically, is absent.

How can anything be considered a currency or some sort of exchange of value if it’s not universally accepted by vendors? At the heart of acceptability lie two problems: Fungibility and getting institutions and merchants to not just consider crypto payment adoption, but actually pull the trigger.

When referring to a budding currency powered by a novel technology outside the bounds of traditional, centralized principles of global finance, fungibility can be quite complex. In order to effectively be considered money, a currency must meet six defined characteristics. It must be durable, portable, recognizable, stable, have limited supply, and be fungible. To be fungible, a currency’s units must be indistinguishable and interchangeable from one another. The U.S. dollar is a prime example of a currency that is universally accepted and meets all six requirements, including fungibility. For example, one U.S. dollar, even if a celebrity like NBA legend Michael Jordan autographs it, is still worth one dollar as a means of currency. Cryptocurrency, however, often suffers from the absence of this type of quality.

Adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was initially centered around its characteristics of privacy and decentralization. But its reputation for privacy has recently been compromised with the advent of sophisticated analysis tools and chain firms that can identify Bitcoin users based on their transaction history. This means users can see who has owned the specific units of crypto crypto, ultimately changing the potential value of the coins. In other circumstances, the value of specific bitcoin units rose above market value because they didn't have transactional histories. Minted without transactional histories, these “virgin bitcoins” appeal to criminal organizations and investors seeking to evade taxes.

The solution to both problems must incorporate uniform price per unit for any cryptocurrency seeking to be accepted by merchants. The proposed model could be multi-tiered, wherein official local exchanges feed information into official online exchanges, enabling real-time price discovery. Legitimate demand as unscrupulous businesses will be voted out in the interests of the community as a whole. There would also need to be a system preventing the ability of creating premium coins worth a higher value.

In order to overcome the problem of coin traceability, which, as mentioned, can raise or lower the value of individual units, a process known as coin ""mixing,"" or ""tumbling""－typically applied to Bitcoin－can resolve this issue. The process involves using software that mixes multiple coins from different wallets and redistributes them back to the originator wallet. Essentially, tumblers combine different sets of coins and proceed to return this combination with differing transaction histories, thus negating the traceability issue. Tumbling doesn’t totally anonymize the transaction, but it does make it tougher to trace. Considering existing alternatives, Bitcoin tumbling has proven to be the most fool-proof way of maintaining transaction privacy.

In addition to the issues of fungibility, there is another question: Who takes the first step? The problem remains not just a matter of fungible units of exchange, but also a matter of who will adopt this medium of payment first. Will merchants adopt first or will users? Without shops offering crypto payment options, non-crypto enthusiasts, who are a majority of the consuming population, won't use it. On the other side of the coin, if not enough consumers own and use crypto on a regular basis, then merchants won't be incentivized to offer crypto payment options.

We can harken back to the credit card story of the 1940s to better understand how cryptocurrency can enter the wallets of the people, and not remain sidelined. As legend holds, in 1946, a Brooklyn banker named John Biggins created the first modern credit card consumers could spend in local shops, and his bank acted as the transactional intermediary. Shortly after, Diner's Club followed suit, and a new age was born of cashless payments.

The value of the credit card was convenience, and it became apparent when the founder of Diner's Club Frank McNamara, as the story goes, forgot his wallet while attending a business dinner. He allegedly returned months later with his business partner to pitch the idea to the restaurant of a charge card. Likewise for crypto, the ""Eureka!"" moment has yet to pass.

Economic recession was not enough in 2008 to motivate consumers to adopt crypto in the same way they did credit cards. Despite the clear business opportunity, like a market size of 50 million users spending €3.4 trillion annually; blockchain wallet adoption rising 425 percent between Q3 of 2016 and Q1 of 2020; cheaper transaction feeds for merchants; and drastically reduced user data attack potential, merchants still don't quite understand it. A Dutch study on virtual currency adoption found that ""unfamiliarity with cryptos is the most cited reason for non-acceptance,"" at 58 percent. The same study also concluded that not enough consumer demand for crypto is the reason merchants are unwilling to offer crypto payment options.

Just as McNamara accomplished in 1950 and paved the way for the credit card era, cryptocurrency companies must be able to replicate the same value propositions. In essence, stronger awareness campaigns are required to foster the demand among, not just consumers, but retailers, too. Most importantly, cryptocurrency campaigns must focus not on supplanting fiat currency and credit cards, but coexistence. Fiat currency will likely never disappear, but cryptocurrency has a unique place in our world as an alternative payment method with its own applications and benefits.

Widespread acceptability among merchants is one of the final few hurdles before crypto achieves price stability and, as a result, mainstream adoption as a relevant form of currency, rather than remains a fad that will eventually fizzle out. A wider awareness campaign alongside intra-crypto regulatory changes provides for a roadmap that will ensure the further advancement in the acceptability of crypto, thereby removing the hurdles in its long-term adoption alongside credit card and fiat currency as viable payment options.

Bitcoin functions as both a currency and an investment. You can use bitcoin to buy items online or send it to other people as a payment or gift. People also invest in bitcoin and hold it as a digital asset.

Since bitcoin operates on a decentralized system, you can send or receive the currency from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is not subject to government controls like fiat currency. Currently, hundreds of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrencies exist. They all seek to make monetary transactions easy and cheap through a decentralized financial system.

How to buy bitcoin

You can obtain bitcoin in three main ways. The first is mining bitcoins, which we’ll get more into later. The second way is accepting bitcoin as a payment for the goods or services you offer. Then the third option is to buy bitcoin.

First, you will need a bitcoin wallet app to hold the bitcoins you buy. Choose a wallet app carefully to ensure the security of your bitcoins. Some marketplaces offer both exchange service and wallet features for users to store their cryptocurrencies. To protect your digital bitcoin wallet, avoid accessing the wallet through unsecured internet connections, like a public WiFi, because that can make your wallet more susceptible to hacking.

Second, some bitcoin exchanges and wallet apps will require you to verify your identity, so have your identification documents ready.

Once your bitcoin wallet is set up, make sure the exchange you choose supports your payment method. Most crypto exchanges and marketplaces support conventional payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and bank transfer. Exchanges may charge a percentage of the purchase price as a transaction fee. You can also buy bitcoin with cash from Bitcoin ATMs. These are like regular cash ATMs, except they are built purposely for buying and selling bitcoin.

Bitcoin currently costs several thousand dollars. But bitcoin exchanges allow you to purchase fractions of bitcoin as you can afford. Depending on the exchange, you can buy bitcoin with fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. The bitcoins you purchase will be transferred to the wallet and store there. From the wallet, you can spend the bitcoins on online purchases, send to your contracts, or hold them as an investment and sell when the price appreciates.",2020-07-29 17:44:25.580000+00:00

Ethereum paved the way for a whole new use case for blockchain technology untethered from Bitcoin’s original vision as electronic cash.

CoinDesk marked the milestone with a special series of stories, live-streamed conversations and even a pop-up newsletter. These charts first appeared in the newsletter, one for each day.

Here are five charts for understanding Ethereum’s evolution.

Part 1: A Bloodless Secession

Source: CoinDesk Research

Not one year after the launch of Ethereum, a seminal event split the community in two.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

So acute was the disagreement between these two subcommunities that the row resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called “ethereum classic,” cloned from the original Ethereum codebase.

Ethereum classic was created July 20, 2016, after $60 million worth of ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, was stolen from users of a dapp known as The DAO. At the time, The DAO was the only dapp of its kind where users could pool funds and vote on which projects the money would be invested in. The DAO’s vision (before it was hacked and drained of a significant chunk of its finances) was to be an investor-guided venture capital fund.

After weeks of deliberation, Ethereum developers reached a consensus that they should turn back the clock – reverse The DAO hack transactions and restore users’ lost ETH. The changes could only be implemented through a network-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork. Those who opposed the change argued in favor of retaining the integrity of the original blockchain’s history of transactions and balances – hacked funds and all.

So, on July 20, 2016, when the upgrade to restore user funds was executed, the Ethereum blockchain split in two. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack and did not upgrade the software created a parallel network, Ethereum Classic.

Since the split, the Ethereum network has hard forked seven additional times, though none of these subsequent upgrades have reached the same level of controversy as “The DAO Fork” of 2016.

Part 2: Those Darned Cats

Source: CoinDesk Research

The first dapp on Ethereum to gain real user traction was a collectibles game known as CryptoKitties. Launched in November 2017, the “digital cats” became so popular they were covered by news outlets around the world including The Financial Post, BBC and The New York Times.

At the height of their popularity, tokenized cats were trading on Ethereum for upwards of $200,000. However, the influx of users and a high volume of transactions from this one viral dapp clogged the Ethereum blockchain to unprecedented levels. A backlog of 30,000 transactions had piled up by December 2017, meaning that users would have to wait days for their transfers of ETH to be confirmed.

The developers behind CryptoKitties hastened to help stem the tide of new users by increasing game fees. Shortly after CryptoKitties’ launch, Ethereum saw the highest total for daily transaction fees in its history, on Jan. 10, 2018. Over $4.5 million was collected in fees by Ethereum miners that day. The same month, CryptoKitties reached 250,000 registered users.

In many respects, the CryptoKitties craze was the rude awakening that reminded Ethereum developers of the platform’s technical limitations. How could Ethereum become the world computer when one viral dapp was enough to overwhelm it? If the developers wanted to be serious about onboarding not thousands but millions of dapp users, they would need to come up with a concrete plan to increase throughput.

Part 3: Testing the Limits

Source: CoinDesk Research

The need for Ethereum 2.0 and its expected benefits to network efficiency as well as scalability has only grown stronger since the CryptoKitties craze of 2017. The popularity of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – a way to crowdfund early stages of a cryptocurrency project – by dollar amount raised reached its peak in 2018. A total of $7.8 billion was raised for over 1,000 projects that year. According to ICObench, over 80% of all ICOs rely on the Ethereum blockchain to create their tokens and issue them to investors.

Trends like the ICO boom of 2018 are indicative of the ways blockchain technology can be leveraged in more ways than simply peer-to-peer electronic cash. Ethereum, as the world’s first general-purpose blockchain platform, has become the central hub where dapp developers congregate to build any and all types of use cases for blockchain, be it gaming- or finance-related.

As a result, despite the technical limitations of the platform, dapp developer activity on Ethereum continues to thrive. The latest trend dominating user traffic and transaction volume on Ethereum is decentralized finance (DeFi). The DeFi movement currently sweeping Ethereum is made up of dapps modeled after traditional financial players such as lending services, exchanges and derivatives markets. As of July 29, 2020, $3.68 billion worth of crypto assets are locked by users into various DeFi protocols.

Part 4: Dapp Dominance

Source: CoinDesk Research

Ethereum’s vision since its inception has always been to be “the world computer” on top of which decentralized applications (dapps) and assets of any kind can be freely created and deployed.

To this end, Ethereum developers pioneered new technology in the emerging space of blockchain called “smart contracts.” A new programming language called Solidity was invented to help code dapps on Ethereum. In order to ensure interoperability between different dapps on the network, common frameworks were developed – like the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards.

These innovations have blazed the trail for other general-purpose blockchain platforms to emerge since Ethereum’s birth in 2015. EOS, Stellar, Tezos and Tron are four cryptocurrencies in the top 15 by market share that also feature dapp creation and deployment. Despite the growth in the number of alternative dapp platforms, Ethereum remains the most popular general-purpose blockchain both in terms of number of users and dapps, as shown in the chart above.

Ethereum hasn’t fulfilled its vision yet, however. Developers are convinced that the current blockchain infrastructure is wholly inadequate to handle an influx of millions, if not billions of users around the world. This was always the suspicion of the early founders of Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin. Five years after releasing their creation into the wild, Buterin and others have worked out a roadmap called “Eth 2.0” to bring Ethereum’s development to completion. Eth 2.0’s first step is expected to launch sometime this year or early next.

Ethereum hasn’t fulfilled its vision yet.

Developers are convinced that the current blockchain infrastructure is wholly inadequate to handle an influx of millions, if not, billions of users around the world. This was always the suspicion of the early founders of Ethereum such as Vitalik Buterin. Five years after releasing their creation into the wild, Buterin and others have worked out a roadmap called “Ethereum 2.0” to bring Ethereum’s development to completion and it is anticipated to launch sometime this year or early next.

The Ethereum 2.0 roadmap is almost as ambitious as the original one which brought the first dapps into existence. While the launch of this technology is forthcoming, an important part of understanding Ethereum’s five-year history lies in studying the many iterations that Ethereum 2.0 underwent in its years of planning.

Originally, Ethereum 2.0 in 2015 was thought of as the final development phase for the project and dubbed “Serenity.” Serenity was tentatively expected to be rolled out 16 months after initial mainnet launch (which would have been November 2016). The upgrade would transition Ethereum from its reliance on a computationally intensive process for block production inherited from Bitcoin, known as “mining,” to a more energy-efficient process of validating.

To this end, developers created what is called the “difficulty bomb” to slowly but surely encourage this transition away from mining. The bomb, which was activated on March 14, 2016, increases the difficulty levels for miners to find an Ethereum block over time. This schedule at which this bomb slows block production has been delayed three times over the course of the last five years as developers re-worked plans for launching Ethereum 2.0.

The most recent delay to the difficulty bomb occurred on Jan. 2, 2020. This may be the last time the difficulty bomb is pushed back as tentative estimations by some developers suggest the transition to Ethereum 2.0 could begin officially sometime this year and replace the existing network by late next year.",2020-07-31 03:00:05+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/police-arrest-27-alleged-masterminds-behind-5-7b-plus-token-crypto-scam,"Disclosure

Crypto startup Diginex has launched a cryptocurrency exchange ahead of its Nasdaq listing which has already been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new exchange is based in Singapore where Diginex has applied for a license.

Diginex Set to List on Nasdaq

A cryptocurrency exchange operator, Diginex, is set to list on the Nasdaq exchange in September, Diginex CEO Richard Byworth confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday. The listing is expected to be made through a $300 million reverse merger with the acquisition of 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., a Nasdaq-listed company. Citing Byworth, the publication conveyed:

The deal has already received SEC approval … the effective listing date should be in mid- to late September.

Diginex said on Thursday that it has launched a cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore where it has applied for a license, even though much of its business is in Hong Kong. The new platform, Equos.io, offers cryptocurrency spot trading and complex derivatives products.

Singapore has recently tightened its oversight of the crypto industry. The country’s new payments rules require cryptocurrency companies to be licensed. Reuters detailed that over 150 cryptocurrency companies that were previously operating in Singapore, including Diginex, have had to apply for licenses by July 28. The strict regulation aims to comply with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This week, Japanese crypto exchange Liquid delisted 29 cryptocurrencies in order to comply with Singapore’s new crypto requirements, as news.Bitcoin.com recently reported.

Hong Kong has an opt-in licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges but does not allow the trading of derivatives products. Its top markets regulator said cryptocurrency futures contracts may be illegal, Byworth explained, adding that “Singapore was a bit more flexible in the way that they were thinking about things.”

However, now there’s a smarter way to invest in cryptocurrencies. Thanks to an innovative crypto startup called BlockFi, you can actually put your crypto holdings to work earning compound interest, significantly increasing your Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, USD Coin, and Gemini Dollar balances over time.

Of course, as you probably know, Investing in cryptocurrencies is inherently risky thanks to the volatility and unpredictability of crypto prices. Nevertheless, because cryptocurrencies have so much raw potential, and because they are relatively insulated from the ups and downs of the stock market, some experts say younger investors should allocate anywhere from 1 to 5 percent of their portfolios to crypto if they can afford the risk.

Understandably, a lot of investors have been nervous to dip their toes into crypto because it is different from the traditional asset classes. However, companies like BlockFi are creating innovative wealth management products that bridge the worlds of traditional finance and crypto. As a result, crypto investing has never been more accessible.

Compound interest is when the interest earned over a specified period is added to the principle. In this way the principle grows over time, the amount of interest paid each period increases, and the initial investment grows at an increasing rate. This type of interest has been available in traditional finance for centuries. However, it hasn’t been available for crypto investors until now.

A BlockFi Interest Account lets you earn compound interest on any cryptocurrency you keep in your account. So instead of just sitting there collecting virtual dust while you wait for the right time to sell, your cryptocurrency actually makes you more cryptocurrency. And the current rates are pretty impressive.

Right now you can earn:

6% in annual interest on Bitcoin deposits up to 5 BTC 3.2% in annual interest on Bitcoin deposits over 5 BTC 4.5% in annual interest on all Etherium deposits 3.8% in annual interest on all Litecoint deposits 8.6% in annual interest on all Gemeni Dollar deposits 8.6% in annual interest on all USDC Dollar deposits



That 8.6% rate for Gemeni Dollars and USCD Dollars is particularly important. Both Gemeni Dollars and USDC Dollars are “stablecoins,” which means they are permanently pegged to the US dollar. The high-interest rate and stable value offers a built-in way to mitigate some of the risks that come with trading in other cryptocurrencies.

Earning compound interest on your crypto might be the number one reason you should sign up for BlockFi. But it isn’t the only reason. BlockFi is a comprehensive platform that lets you seamlessly manage your crypto assets and optimize portfolio allocation. Users can add funds to their account with their local fiat currency, and as soon as it shows up in their dashboard, begin trading with zero hidden fees.

BlockFi also offers crypto-backed loans. Using your crypto holdings as collateral, you can get loans worth up to 50 percent of the value of your assets at a highly competitive 4.5 percent interest rate. BlockFi clients take advantage of this unique feature to do everything from paying off credit card debts and buying homes, to starting and expanding small businesses.

Anyone thinking about investing in cryptocurrencies should ALWAYS consult a licensed financial advisor to make sure it’s right for them. And if you’re interested in BlockFi, you should contact your advisor as soon as possible, because right now they’re offering a bonus of up to $1,000 in Bitcoin when you sign up and trade.

That’s a deal you don’t want to miss out on.

The teen, whose name and photo CNBC is not publishing because the teen is a minor, was arrested and charged, the office of Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren announced on Friday.

Warren's office described the teen as the ""mastermind"" behind the attack.

""These crimes were perpetrated using the names of famous people and celebrities, but they're not the primary victims here,"" Warren said in a statement. ""This 'Bit-Con' was designed to steal money from regular Americans from all over the country, including here in Florida. This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that.""

Warren's office has filed 30 felony charges against the 17-year-old. The charges include organized fraud, communications fraud, fraudulent use of personal information and access of computer or electronic device without authority.

Two adults were also charged, the Department of Justice said Friday.

Mason Sheppard, aka ""Chaewon,"" 19, of Bognor Regis, in the United Kingdom, was charged in a criminal complaint in the Northern District of California with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and the intentional access of a protected computer.

Nima Fazeli, aka ""Rolex,"" 22, of Orlando, Florida, was charged in a criminal complaint in the Northern District of California with aiding and abetting the intentional access of a protected computer.

The teen's scam reaped more than $100,000 worth of bitcoin on July 15, according to Warren's office.

Twitter provided its most recent update into the attack on Thursday evening.

""The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack,"" Twitter said in a blog post. ""A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to both our internal network as well as specific employee credentials that granted them access to our internal support tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain information about our processes.""

Twitter acknowledged the charges and arrest on Friday.

""We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses,"" Twitter said in a tweet. ""For our part, we are focused on being transparent and providing updates regularly.""

The new feature will allow users to automate purchases of Bitcoin on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis; purchases can be made for as low as USD $50. The company also says that users will have the ability to add this feature to a wider variety of coins in the coming weeks.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

The new feature was added just one day after Bitcoin’s long period of stagnancy seems to have ended. For nearly two months, Bitcoin floated in between roughly $8,800 and $9,800, occasionally popping over $10,000, but never for any meaningful length of time.

BTC bulls may be looking to stock up on coins before a predicted price runt to $50k

However, at press time, Bitcoin had maintained levels over $11,000 for several days. The coin originally surpassed $11,000 or Tuesday and appeared to be holding strong at the same level on Friday.

Some analysts believe that the pass and hold over $11,000 may be the first move on a long bull run towards a $50,000 price level.

For example, Brian Kelly, hedge fund manager and CNBC contributor, recently said on the network’s Fast Money program that “when I look at the Bitcoin cycles, the bull markets tend to cluster around the halvenings…[which] would imply that sometime in Q2 2021, you’re looking at a Bitcoin price of $50,000.”

$50k also seems to be the new favorite number of a number of crypto Twitter insiders.

Therefore, this could be a time when a heightened number of Bitcoin bulls may want to stock up on coins at a perceived “discount”–that is, before the price rally continues (if, indeed, it does). In other words, Crypto.com’s new feature may be coming at the perfect time.

Then again, the fact that Bitcoin has hit over $10,000 so many times before (and even sustained levels over $10,000 for several weeks) could mean that this time won’t be any different. BTC could see a dip back below $10k, or even lower.

New users appear to be entering the cryptocurrency space

In any case, Bitcoin–and cryptocurrencies more generally–do seem to be growing in popularity. Along with BTC’s recent bull run, a number of altcoins have performed very well in recent weeks.

This could be due to an influx of new users into the crypto space: people who seem to be searching for new streams of income in the face of growing economic uncertainty around the globe.

Indeed, a number of cryptocurrency platforms have reported massive numbers of new users over the past several months. Crypto.com is among them–in early July, Crypto.com chief executive Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk that the company had boosted its total number of users by at least 50 percent in the preceding two months to 3 million.",2020-07-31 07:01:28+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-pushes-to-11450-defi-value-locked-now-at-4b,"Bitcoin and ether continue to make gains Friday and stakeholders are increasingly investing their crypto into DeFi.

“The U.S. Q2 GDP results were rough and traditional markets are seeing a bit of risk off – a sharp move lower in yields and weakness in stocks,” Dan Koehler, liquidity manager for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, told CoinDesk. “It’s a crucial time for bitcoin, in my view.”

Indeed, stocks are taking a beating Friday, with major global indexes down or flat.

Bitcoin beat major equity indexes for July, up over 20% for the month. “It will be interesting to see how bitcoin behaves in a risk-off environment this time around, having broken and thus far held above $10,400,” added OKCoin’s Koehler.

Michael Rabkin, head of institutional sales at crypto trading firm DV Chain, said a positive news cycle on the crypto front is helping the market. “We’ve been seeing more buying over the last few days, specifically since the past week’s announcement which would allow banks to hold custody,” he said.

“There’s definitely a more bullish sentiment since that announcement came out and as we’ve seen, has resulted in upward momentum,” Rabkin added

Mostafa Al-Mashita of Global Digital Assets, a digital assets-focused merchant bank, said alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, is where he expects traders to take profits near-term. “The market is consolidating as altcoins catch up to the recent bitcoin pump,” he said. “I would expect altcoins to lead for a few days before bitcoin rising again.”

DeFi locked at $4B

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $344 and climbing 3.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Since June 1, the total value locked in Ethereum-powered decentralized finance, or DeFi, has risen 300% from $1 billion to $4 billion, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.

In just two months, total bitcoin locked in DeFi more than quadrupled from 4,975 to 20,610 BTC. Total ether locked in DeFi has grown 60%, from 2.6 million to 4.2 million ETH. Stablecoin dai locked is up 19%, from 365 million to 435 million.

Azamat Malaev, co-founder of HodlTree, a new DeFi protocol for interest-yielding tokens, said the catalyst for this growth was investors locking crypto with a particular big DeFi lender to achieve “yield” or profit. ”It started with the launch of the Compound token distribution on June 15,” he said. “And, of course, with a time delay information began to spread.”

Both companies made strong statements in support of the use of cryptocurrencies in July by announcing respective projects and collaborations that are driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The positive attitude toward cryptocurrency exchanges and payment platforms from the world’s largest traditional payment processors signals a shift in perception from the traditional financial space. Mastercard has been actively encouraging exchanges and payment service providers to enlist in its recently expanded cryptocurrency card program, becoming partners in just a few weeks as part of its Accelerate program. Meanwhile, Visa outlined its vision of the cryptocurrency space with an overarching theme of positivity toward the market and the role it will play.

The payment service provider noted digital currencies as an exciting avenue to expand existing network-of-networks to support the latest technology powering global commerce. These two global giants are not just offering lip service, either; their payment cards and technology are already powering a number of platforms and service providers within the crypto space. The likes of Coinbase and Binance crypto exchanges use either Visa or Mastercard to power their crypto debit card services.

Visa’s and Mastercard’s relationship with crypto is growing

Visa’s public affirmation of its positive stance toward cryptocurrency payment services reflects its drive to remain a leading player in the global payment network. As highlighted in its “outlook on new digital currency payment flows,” the company admits that a growing body of players in the traditional financial sphere has been looking to plug into the crypto space: “It’s a concept that is gaining traction beyond fintechs.”

The company has already established a working relationship with some leading cryptocurrency-based firms in 2020, including Coinbase and Fold. This is in addition to more than 25 cryptocurrency wallets that are connected to Visa’s systems. Visa also has its fintech-focused accelerator program called FastTrack, which allows tech firms including cryptocurrency and blockchain-based companies to access its systems and network.

The company has also been developing its own cryptocurrency projects that include an investment into tech firm Anchorage, which builds security infrastructure for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its research team has also been working in the blockchain space for a number of years, culminating in the creation of the white papers for the Zether and FlyClient projects.

Furthermore, Visa has been involved in helping shape regulations and policies toward cryptocurrencies around the world. It has worked with the World Economic Forum to develop recommendations for central banks looking into the use cases of central bank digital currencies. Cointelegraph reached out to Visa for additional insights, but the company declined to provide any further information other than its blog post.

Mastercard has been actively encouraging crypto exchanges and payment service providers to sign up to their Accelerate platform in an effort to expedite the process to become partners by fast-tracking the onboarding of new crypto debit and credit card providers while providing added assistance for market entry and expansion in different countries. Nevertheless, prospective partners need to meet stringent requirements set by Mastercard. This includes high levels of consumer protection and compliance with AML/KYC regulations.

This move to collaborate with the crypto industry comes off the back of the news that Wirex became the first cryptocurrency platform granted a Mastercard principal membership. Part of the functionality allows users the ability to instantly convert cryptocurrencies into conventional fiat currency. An added benefit is a rewards program that gives users 1.5% of purchases made with these cards in Bitcoin.

Bridging the divide

Recently, Binance confirmed that a limited run of its Binance Cards is being shipped to Europe. The move adds real substance to the statements made by Visa and Mastercard, as users are beginning to have access to these card services through some of the biggest players in the cryptocurrency exchange space.

According to Josh Goodbody, the director of European and Latin American growth and institutional business at Binance, traditional banking cards are a “bridge between the crypto and traditional finance,” adding: “Crypto debit cards provide a tangible and frictionless way to spend your crypto, and it provides users with the ability to incorporate crypto into their day-to-day lives.”

Goodbody declined to go into detail about the direct working relationship with Visa but stated that the acquisition of cryptocurrency payment platform Swipe would allow Binance to tap into an established network of regional service providers where the company hopes to bring new users into the cryptocurrency space. Goodbody believes that mainstream financial firms will have a key role to play in this:

“Visa and other networks’ willingness to work with the blockchain industry is a very positive vote of confidence for the further adoption of cryptocurrencies. Not only are traditional technology providers facilitating adoption, they are actively participating in the development of the ecosystem — we see this as an opportunity to further the adoption and accessibility of cryptocurrencies.”

Crypto analyst Mati Greenspan also complimented the move by Mastercard and Visa in the Quantum Economics email newsletter from late July, saying: “As far as fundamentals are concerned, this is about as bullish as it gets for Bitcoin and the gang.”

Netanel Kabala, the chief analytics officer and co-founder of payment platform Simplex, told Cointelegraph that his company has been working alongside Visa and Mastercard for seven years. The relationship has allowed the company to open up cryptocurrency offerings to new users exploring alternative investment methods: “Crypto adoption is growing globally as people seek out alternative investment avenues.” Kabala identified a lag time for new users being introduced into crypto, but the integration of mainstream financial institutions like Mastercard and Visa is a strong signal:

“From an analytics standpoint, we’re seeing many new users enter the crypto world. With every new technology or advancement, it often does take some time before the general public incorporates it into the mainstream. While we definitely believed this mainstream adoption would have come earlier, it seems to be starting now.”

Simplex CEO Nimrod Lehavi believes that there is a more receptive perception to the potential benefits of cryptocurrency, mainly driven by people who want to wrestle back control of their assets and ability to transact independently: “Anything that lowers friction and helps people gain full control of their assets will spread adoption, and crypto-connected debit and credit cards are a key component in that regard.”

Financial industry leaders like Mastercard and Visa vocally supporting and actively working with cryptocurrency and blockchain firms add more credence to the value and utility of these services. Lehavi believes that this will open the door to more users that have not been exposed to digital assets: “The support of major players removes a great deal of the uncertainty people might have regarding cryptocurrencies and will enable them to discover digital assets for what they are.”",,https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-arrests-over-100-people-suspected-of-involvement-in-plustoken-cryptocurrency-scam/,"Network of fake QR code generators will steal your Bitcoin Watch Now

China has arrested 109 individuals suspected of involvement in the PlusToken cryptocurrency fraud ring.

South Korea-based PlusToken was marketed as a high-yield investment opportunity for traders interested in cryptocurrencies. 9% to 18% in monthly returns were dangled in front of investors mainly based in China and South Korea, who then stored Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS on the platform.

Members were encouraged to bring others to the fold in exchange for a commission, creating what is thought to be a Ponzi scheme of massive proportions.

Last year, the operators of PlusToken performed a suspected exit scam, in which roughly $3 billion in deposits was taken from up to four million users who suddenly found themselves unable to access their funds.

Local media outlet Chain News now suggests this figure could be closer to $6 billion.

PlusToken's dissolution led to an international hunt for those responsible. In 2019, Chinese law enforcement arrested six suspects -- while many others fled abroad -- and now, a further 27 individuals are in custody.

CNET: Twitter says massive hack was result of spear phishing attack

The Ministry of Public Security and Chinese police have apprehended 27 ""major criminal suspects"" and a further 82 ""key"" members of PlusToken, described as a ""network pyramid scheme.""

Law enforcement added that 3,000 ""hierarchical relationships"" have since been traced throughout the PlusToken network.

The suspects may have been cornered, but investor funds are still on the move. Over 6,000 separate wallet addresses have been used to divide up and move the cryptocurrencies around in what is likely to be an effort at obfuscation, but researchers have still managed to keep a close eye on where the cryptocurrencies are going -- at least, for now.

In the UK, authorities forcefully closed down a cryptocurrency scam platform, GPay Ltd, earlier this month. The UK High Court ordered the windup of GPay following the ""loss"" of £1.5 million ($1.8m) in investor funds.

GPay is also accused of fraudulently using celebrity images to endorse its business.

Key Takeaways Coinbase has plans to list 19 new DeFi tokens on its exchange

Many of those tokens are related to Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem

Not every token will necessarily be listed, but it seems likely that some will be added to the exchange

Share this article

Coinbase could add several major DeFi cryptocurrencies to its exchange listings, including AMPL, BAL, BAND, CRV, and KAVA, according to the company’s latest blog post.

Tokens Under Consideration

Many of these assets are related to Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem, including the tokens associated with:

Ampleforth (AMPL), a cryptocurrency with a dynamically adjusted supply, using economics similar to stablecoins

Band Protocol (BAND), an oracle platform for multiple blockchains that connects real-world data to smart contracts

Balancer (BAL), a decentralized exchange and automated market maker for ERC-20 token trading

Curve Finance (CRV), a decentralized exchange and liquidity pool

Kava (KAVA), a DeFi lending platform that allows users to mint stablecoins by staking their crypto holdings

Wrapped BTC (WBTC), a Bitcoin-Ethereum bridge token

Some of these platforms are used by yield farmers, who invest their cryptocurrency in the service to earn interest over time.

Coinbase is also considering 13 other tokens: Blockstack (STX), Fetch.ai (FET), Flexacoin (FXC), Helium (HNT, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Melon (MLN), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), Paxos Gold (PAXG), Reserve Rights (RSR), tBTC (tBTC), The Graph, THETA (THETA), and UMA (UMA).

These listings have the potential to pump token prices, based on the market’s historical reaction to listings.

When Will These Tokens Be Listed?

There is no guarantee that Coinbase will list all of these tokens. Before listing any token, the company must review each token’s security, compliance, and mission statement. “We … cannot guarantee whether or when any above-listed asset will be listed on a Coinbase product in any jurisdiction,” says Coinbase.

However, Coinbase has listed tokens quite quickly in the past. In June, Coinbase revealed plans to list 18 other cryptocurrencies, including Aave, Bancor, Compound, and Synthetix. At least six of the tokens in that announcement have been listed just one month later.

Despite Coinbase’s openness to new projects, the company is extremely selective. It currently lists 23 different cryptocurrencies, while Coinbase Pro lists 28 different cryptocurrencies.

The project’s market capitalization, now the 12th highest among all digital assets at $2.7 billion, according to CoinGecko, reflects investor perceptions of Chainlink as the leading crypto “oracle” provider. That means it supplies prices and data streams to semi-automated lending and trading systems built atop blockchains.

The function is crucial in the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which has generated such a speculative fervor in recent months that supposed money-of-the-future bitcoin has almost started to look passé.

But now Chainlink’s early lead as the dominant DeFi oracle is starting to attract competitors, and cryptocurrency investors are wondering if the niche industry might be due for a shakeup. Given the key role played by oracles in DeFi, users of the decentralized systems also stand to benefit.

Potential rivals could include dedicated oracle upstarts like Tellor as well as leading DeFi projects like MakerDAO that are developing their own solutions. Another data oracle, Band Protocol, launched a new version of its network on the Cosmos blockchain last month, to avoid congestion on the more popular Ethereum network, on which Chainlink runs. Others in the space include Augur and Nest, according to the industry-tracking website DeFi Pulse.

“I think it’s good that there are different projects that are offering this, obviously,” Niklas Kunkel, head of backend services for MakerDAO, said in a phone interview.

Chainlink has taken a commanding lead among DeFi oracles, a perch that’s been strengthened with frequent announcements of new partnerships and node operators. Just last week, Deutsche Telekom’s IT subsidiary, T-Systems, announced plans to join Chainlink as a node operator. This past Friday, Korean banks IBK Bank, Shinhan Bank, KEB Bank, NH Bank and CenterPrime announced they plan to provide oracle data for Chainlink.

The project even has galvanized a community around it, and its most ardent supporters are known as Chainlink Marines on social media.

DeFi applications are built using “smart contracts” – strings of computer programming that are embedded into blockchain networks and designed to automate specific functions like lending or cryptocurrency swaps, based on incoming data inputs. There’s no human middlemen as in the case of centralized banks and Wall Street trading firms to monitor pricing, so the smart contracts rely on distributed input sources, known as oracles.

Under Chainlink’s protocol, data is aggregated from third parties and then batched into oracle feeds that are streamed out to DeFi systems. Various information providers, mostly from the cryptocurrency ecosystem, provide the data as “node operators” and are rewarded with payments in LINK. Many of Chainlink’s oracles have over a dozen participants.

Chainlink’s most popular product is pricing for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin; the platform lists 36 trading pairs on its website.

“If you don’t have data on-chain, you can’t build a contract for a certain market,” Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, told First Mover in a phone interview. “We don’t make contracts. We don’t secure blocks. We don’t secure transactions. We just feed data into various systems.”

But in the fast-moving DeFi industry, where anything resembling an establishment could be years or even decades in the making, few competitors are ready to concede.

MakerDAO, the decentralized-lending project behind the dollar-linked stablecoin dai, has provided its own distributed oracles since 2017 and now lists seven price feeds on its website.

DeFi projects including 0x, Gnosis and Kyber Network are using MakerDAO’s oracle feeds as well as contributing to them as third-party data sources, according to Kunkel. Node operators in MakerDAO oracles are chosen and paid in the project’s cryptocurrency, dai.

“When we started building dai, there weren’t any existing oracles that we could utilize,” Niklas Kunkel, head of backend services for MakerDAO, told First Mover in a phone interview.

A newer entrant is Tellor, which uses a complex algorithm, based on the SHA-256 hash function that’s used in bitcoin mining, to assure the integrity of its data.

“Miners compete for the right to submit the data,” Tellor CSO Michael Zemrose said in a Telegram chat.

The rewards for providing data are paid out in Tellor’s native token, TRB. Its price has nearly quadrupled this year, but off of a smaller base: The token’s market capitalization stands at just $16 million according to CoinGecko, a tiny fraction of LINK’s.

At this point, the DeFi oracle market is Chainlink’s to lose.

BTC: Price: $11,196 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,214 | 24-Hr Low: $10,847

Trend: Bitcoin has been struggling to maintain momentum since a quick rush of volatility and a price surge to multi-month highs above $11,300 on Monday.

Since then, the price action has been largely centered around $11,000, with both lower highs and higher lows setting up a contracting triangle on the hourly chart. Such a pattern atop a prior bullish run ($9,000 to $11,300) is known as a bull pennant.

Chart analysts consider a bull pennant as a continuation pattern – one that recharges the bulls’ engines for an extension of the preceding rally. As such, we may see a bullish breakout and a rally toward the resistance at $12,000. A move above the upper end of the pennant, currently at $11,317, is needed to confirm the breakout.

That said, the possibility of the breakout failing to accelerate the uptrend cannot be ruled out, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print. In addition, Thursday’s doji candle is signaling buyer exhaustion.

If prices drop below the pennant support, currently at $10,920, a deeper decline toward the former hurdle-turned-support at $10,500 (February 2018 high) may be seen.

Muneeb Ali, co-founder and CEO of Blockstack open-source platform, believes that the best way to bring about a user-owned internet ""is to anchor applications and smart contracts to the Bitcoin network in a way that uses Bitcoin as a reserve currency and its powerful blockchain as a security mechanism.""

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Ali stated that Bitcoin has been the king of blockchains for more than a decade, as most people have come to recognize that the Bitcoin network is “unparalleled” when it comes to security:

“We believe that the new Stacks 2.0 blockchain, currently in testnet, holds one solution for making Bitcoin the foundation for smart contracts in Web 3.0. With the Clarity smart contract programming language and the Proof of Transfer mechanism, developers can build smart contracts in a much more secure language that is predictable, decidable.”

Ethereum as a frontrunner for smart contracts

Traditionally, Bitcoin has been recognized as a secure network, whereas Ethereum has been a “frontrunner” when it comes to smart contracts, according to Ali. Blockstack’s founder elaborated further on the discussion:

“Bitcoin’s limited scripting language has been seen as a dealbreaker to developers looking to build dapps or deploy smart contracts. As a result, many developers end up building their own blockchains, hoping to bootstrap native proof-of-work protocols or proof-of-stake, but these tend to be much less secure. One of the results is developers assume Ethereum is better suited for launching smart contracts, but I believe this is premature.”

Ali also pointed out that the future of the internet will not be a “tradeoff of convenience for security,” but will instead be tying that security to web applications in a way that uses Bitcoin as a reserve currency along with its blockchain as a security mechanism.

Regarding the web 3.0 era, Ali thinks that of particular note is the recent “rise in conversation about the possibilities of ‘DeFi on the Bitcoin’.” For the Blockstack’s founder, this means more people are looking to anchor in the security of Bitcoin when it comes to financial products:",,https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2020/08/01/twitter-teen-makes-first-court-appearance-in-tampa/,"TAMPA — The teen accused of masterminding the Twitter hack of the accounts of celebrities and major companies in an illicit attempt to obtain Bitcoin had his bail set on Saturday:

It is $725,000.

But the attorney for 17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark said his client has more than $3 million worth of Bitcoin.

His bail is six times what he’s accused of stealing last month through an elaborate scheme that authorities say unfolded online on July 15. It involved manipulating Twitter employees, taking control of celebrity and company Twitter accounts and reaping $117,000 in the hard-to-track cryptocurrency within a matter of hours.

Authorities say the Tampa teen is the “mastermind” of the plot, in which he used prominent Twitter accounts including former Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian to solicit for Bitcoin. When he made his first court appearance Saturday, authorities described in greater detail how they say he pulled it off.

Clark was in the county jail, but appeared on a video screen in a small courtroom in front of County Judge Joelle Ann Ober inside the Hillsborough County Courthouse Annex building.

He faces state charges because he is a juvenile, federal authorities say, and was held without bail when he was arrested Friday. Two others involved in the scheme face federal charges in California.

Under Florida law, it would take 10 percent of the bail set Saturday — $72,500 — to free Clark pending trial.

Both sides argued over what would be an appropriate amount of bail for a 17-year-old facing 30 criminal charges.

Hillsborough Assistant State Attorney Darrell Dirks called Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent Corey Monaghan to testify.

The agent said Clark hired 22-year-old Nima Fazeli of Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard of the United Kingdom “as proxies” to “manipulate” Twitter employees into giving up access to the company’s system. He declined to specify how Fazeli and Sheppard, who face federal charges in the Northern District of California, manipulated employees.

Twitter on Thursday updated a blog post it published after the scheme played out, calling the hack of its systems “social engineering” that targeted “a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack” to obtain their credentials and access to Twitter’s systems.

“This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,” the company wrote.

The New York Times reported in July that the hacker accessed Twitter’s internal Slack messaging system and gained control of special tools that could be used to take over any Twitter account.

Prosecutors sought bail at $1 million per charge for each of Clark’s 30 counts and argued Florida case law says he must prove the money used to post his bail was legitimately obtained.

“Because, based upon the conduct of this defendant, I believe it’s appropriate to assume that every single penny that this defendant has access to is by ill-gotten gains,” the prosecutor said. “And we’re talking about millions of dollars.”

Defense attorney David Weisbrod denied that his client’s assets were illegally obtained. He explained to the judge that Clark was the subject of a criminal investigation last year conducted by prosecutors in Hillsborough and Santa Clara, Calif. They obtained a search warrant and seized about $15,000 in cash from Clark, plus 400 Bitcoin, Weisbrod said.

When prosecutors declined to charge Clark in April, his defense attorney said, they returned to him the cash and 300 Bitcoin, which is worth more than $3 million. Weisbrod argued that legitimizes those assets.

“I can think of no greater indication of legitimacy than law enforcement giving the money back,” said Weisbrod. He asked the judge to set bail at $20,000.

The judge decided to set bail at $25,000 per 29 counts. For the 30th charge, the judge ordered that if Clark posts bail he must wear an electronic monitor and be confined to his home, except for visits to the doctor or his attorney. The judge barred him from accessing the internet on any device and ordered the 17-year-old to surrender his passport if he has one.

Some of the celebrities who authorities say were hacked by Clark included presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Mike Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Wiz Khalifa, Floyd Mayweather, Elon Musk and Kanye West. A handful of companies had their accounts hacked, too, including Apple and Uber. Twitter said the hackers had access to 130 Twitter accounts and tweeted from 45.

Clark faces 17 counts of communications fraud, 11 counts of fraudulent use of personal information and one count each of organized fraud for more than $5,000 and accessing a computer or electronic device without authority.",2020-08-01 00:00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/08/01/analyst-obscure-crypto-asset-set-to-skyrocket-traders-should-have-bitcoin-ethereum-and-five-altcoins-on-their-radar/,"Full-time cryptocurrency trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe says one enterprise blockchain platform is on track to skyrocket within the month.

So far, the strategist says Ontology (ONT) is following his script, which predicts the coin will ultimately surge to $1.07, which would effectively double its value from when he first made the call back in June. At the time, ONT was trading at $0.53.

Van de Poppe believes Bitcoin bulls are in control after turning $10,900 resistance into support. According to the crypto strategist, the bullish signal indicates that Bitcoin is likely to climb to $11,500.

As for Ethereum, the analyst says he’s eager to buy the dip. Should bulls continue to rampage, he sees the second-largest cryptocurrency ascending as high as $405 in the near term. Otherwise, he’s predicting a drop to $280.

The trader is also bullish on the XRP/BTC pair in the short term. He says as long as it is above 2,100 satoshis, it will likely head to 2,500 satoshis this month.

Van de Poppe is also looking at three altcoins that he believes have a lot of upside potential. He says while the ZIL/BTC (Zilliqa) pair has been on a downtrend, he thinks it is ripe to bottom out, which would offer the opportunity for a quick and simple trade.

It’s the same case for VET/BTC (VeChain). The crypto pair may also be on the verge of bottoming out but he admits that VET/BTC is still on a downtrend.

He’s also looking at LINK/BTC (ChainLink), which is currently in the midst of a deep retracement. He is still waiting for the crypto token to drop even more before placing long positions.

“It is even more likely that we’ll get that retest of previous resistance [turned into] support, which is the 55,000 [satoshis] level as this structure does not seem we’re going to have further momentum upwards.”

Three years ago at approximately 2:14 p.m. ET, the first Bitcoin Cash blocks were mined. That day, block 478,558 was the last common block found, and six hours later Viabtc mined the first Bitcoin Cash block (nr 478,559). The course of history was changed ever since this point, as the scaling debate took the dispute to a whole new level.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) proponents are celebrating the third anniversary of the chain split that took place three years ago on August 1st. The peer-to-peer electronic cash system has come a long way since then and many proponents have appreciated the project’s accomplishments.

Moreover, a free market currency like BCH is needed more than ever because governments and central banks worldwide have wreaked havoc on the world’s monetary system.

On August 1, 2017, cryptocurrency advocates everywhere were glued to their monitors when the first BCH block (nr 478,559) was mined by the mining pool Viabtc. The China-based mining pool also found the next block 478,560 shortly after.

When the chain split that afternoon on August 1, the BCH chain was equipped with 8MB blocks. In fact, the first BCH block was 1915175 Bytes or 1.9 MB in size, holding 6,985 transactions. Viabtc also left a message in the block’s coinbase parameter which said:

Welcome to the world, Shuya Yang!

By August 2, the BCH market was the third-largest by capitalization and for both blockchains, the transition was smooth. Since then there’s been a number of development improvements over the years.

Bitcoin Cash now has Schnorr signature capabilities, a 32MB block capacity, faster re-spending of unconfirmed transactions, re-enabled old Satoshi opcodes, and more.

The digital currency is supported by nearly every major wallet, a myriad of crypto exchanges, and there are thousands of merchants who accept BCH worldwide. Bitcoin Cash also has a robust mixing technology called Cashfusion, which just completed its security audit.

Moreover, BCH also has a resilient and easy to use tokenization system called the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). And to top it all off, for the last three years, Bitcoin Cash proponents have been a boisterous bunch of peer-to-peer electronic cash enthusiasts.

This anniversary a number of BCH developers, enthusiasts, business executives, and miners will be celebrating the momentous occasion. At 7 a.m. ET, an online conference being held called “BCH Scaling for the Globe: Bitcoin Cash 2020 ForkDay Celebration” will be streaming with a variety of Bitcoin Cash influencers.

The BCH Meetup group in Bangkok will be hosting a special celebration, and BCH proponent, Hayden Otto, is hosting the first slot of the Bitcoin Cash third anniversary live stream organized by @Bitcoincashcity and @Satoshiangels.

C. Edward Kelso (@Cryptokelso) will be having a “post-Pomp interview” with Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver, Edge Wallet’s Paul Puey, and software engineer Josh Ellithorpe (@zquestz). The Bitcoin Cash Games casino platform launched a $3k leaderboard tournament to celebrate the third BCH anniversary as well.

Additionally, on the BCH-fueled blogging platform read.cash, a number of supporters have been sharing their perspectives on the BCH fork, and people have been discussing the anniversary on the Reddit forum r/btc as well. Overall it should be a lively day of celebrations and memories as BCH fans are always a vibrant flock.

Chaturbate COO Shirley Lara, one of the most experienced platform executives in the adult content industry, has been keen on bitcoin’s potential since 2018.

“We accept 20 different cryptocurrencies for token purchases. The most popular ones are bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin,” Lara said.

Experts, including Lara, estimate there “thousands and thousands” of cam girls working across platforms like OnlyFan and Chaturbate at any given time. That dwarfs the incumbent porn industry. Today, OnlyFans alone is estimated to have 60,000 content creator accounts and millions of registered viewers, despite some criticism from sex workers on Twitter.

Many of the leading sex industry corporations, like OnlyFans, Chaturbate and MindGeek, appear to be owned by (relatively secretive) men, who are far removed from the public performers. Lara, who joined Chaturbate in 2011, is one of the rare examples of a woman who worked her way up to the executive level without first creating a personal porn star brand. Her work is primarily technical and operational.

“I don’t think crypto is a trend. I think it’s definitely here to stay,” Lara said, noting the steady incline of bitcoin usage among performers in Colombia and Romania. “They’ll use cryptocurrency as a way to jump on [Chaturbate] and get started while they figure out the banking stuff.”

Meanwhile, her global operations allow performers like Honey Li, in Europe, to stack sats through Chaturbate. Li said a little bit of her earnings, in addition to whatever she needs to pay bills, is set aside as bitcoin savings. For Lara, having this choice was crucial to the platform’s crypto integrations.

“You asked if we hold on to bitcoin? We don’t. We cash out. But our broadcasters do (hodl), and I think that is so smart,” Lara said.

With porn production stalled or canceled in hubs like Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the entire sex industry is shifting geographies.

More performers are relying on social media to broadcast from home. Bitcoin may now offer a different use case for platform performers versus high-end escorts, for example. The sex industry is hardly a monolith.

Tech tools

While social porn platforms inspire more mainstream content creators to dabble in adult themes, this further divides in-person service providers and filmmakers.

One such provider, Nina Mona, has been using bitcoin in the sex industry for two years. For her, she emphasizes bitcoin privacy tech, which would be irrelevant for users who already submit know-your-customer information to a central platform. She uses bitcoin to accept payments and also to pay advertisers without sharing her credit card information.

“I noticed a wave of OnlyFans signups when in-person work became less viable. I considered it, but don’t think the return is worth the workload or risk of exposure for me,” Mona said. “It seems safer to limit myself to a small set of screened clients than to share compromising material with a broader and less invested audience. Every set of eyeballs is an additional threat.”

In the United States, Mona said most clients who booked sessions with bitcoin resided in the Bay Area, Los Angeles or New York. Now that COVID-19 sparked some domestic migration, it’s unclear how this will impact sex workers who focused on urban hubs. For some, this means more travel and extremely selective bookings.

Performers and escorts may both operate their own wallets, even if they use platforms like OnlyFans or Chaturbate, especially to receive gifts and tributes from afar. Plus, Lara said the teledildonics trend, where internet-connected sex toys can be set to vibrate when their accounts receive payments, create new opportunities for clients to incorporate money into their fantasies.

“There’s this whole teledildonics spectrum that is growing in popularity,” she said. Li agreed with Lara, especially because there are toys for both genders that can be used in synchronized ways.

“I use teledildonic toys for work, basically every shift!” Li said. “They’re tip-activated when I work. … You can also sync the vibrations up to a Spotify account or a voice note sent by your partner.”

Slow growth

Mainstream platforms like Chaturbate and competitor FanCentro already accept cryptocurrency and have been working with it for years. Usage is niche, yet steady.

Many sex workers say a direct transaction and relationship is more profitable than payment facilitated by a platform. Chaturbate, for example, charges nearly half of the performer’s earnings. It provides a valuable service, but clients will need to be willing to pay in bitcoin if the performer aims to graduate to her own independent site.

“If we’re headed that way, it’s going to be a long time before we hit that milestone, because of the different governance in each country,” Lara said.

One FanCentro user and crypto owner, who goes by the alias WesMan83, said he would be happy to pay a sex worker directly in crypto if she preferred. He finds erotic service-providers that suit him using mainstream platforms like Twitter and OnlyFans, as well as personal recommendations from other clients and providers.",2020-08-01 14:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-classic-undergoes-likely-51-attack-with-3693-block-chain-reorganization,"Ethereum Classic suffered a 3,693-blockchain reorganization early Saturday morning, an event first thought to be a possible 51% attack, after a miner used old software after having been offline, according to Terry Culver, CEO of Ethereum Classic Labs.

Russia’s bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. The new law gives legal status to cryptocurrency but prohibits its use as a means of payment.

Russian Crypto Bill Signed Into Law

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law Friday the bill that regulates digital financial asset (DFA) transactions, Russian media RIA Novosti reported. It was approved by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on July 22 and by the Federation Council on July 24. The law will come into force on Jan. 1, 2021.

The law gives a definition to digital currency, stating that it “is recognized as an aggregate of electronic data capable of being accepted as the payment means, not being the monetary unit of the Russian Federation or a foreign state, and as investments,” Russian news agency TASS described. “The digital currency cannot be used at the same time to pay for any goods and services.”

Meanwhile, the law sets forth that digital financial assets “are digital rights comprising money claims, ability to exercise rights under negotiable securities, rights to participate in equity of a non-public stock company and right to claim transfer of negotiable securities set in a resolution on the DFA issue,” TASS noted. These assets can be sold, purchased, exchanged, and pledged. However, they cannot be used as a means of payment.

Russian banks and exchanges can become exchange operators of digital financial assets provided that they register with the central bank, the Bank of Russia. The publication elaborated:

The central bank is vested with the authority to maintain the register of information systems and the register of operators of digital financial assets exchange and supervise the business of information system operators.

Individuals and legal entities in Russia will only be able to challenge cryptocurrency transactions in court if they have declared these transactions and their possession of cryptocurrency, RIA Novosti detailed.

A number of cryptocurrency-related terms were excluded in the final bill after the second reading, such as “token” and “mining.” Anatoly Aksakov, head of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, told the news outlet that more detailed cryptocurrency regulation will be in another bill, which may be adopted in the autumn session. The bill that Putin signed into law is posted on the Russian government’s official internet-portal of legal information and can be found here.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin failed to perform well as a hedge during the crash in March 2020.

Stablecoins and DeFi are expanding and may become a better proxy for attracting new users to the blockchain space.

While printing USD in March 2020 was dictated by the global market’s demand, data suggests that printing stablecoins was not.

Share this article

The blockchain space originated amid the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The genesis block of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, contained the message: “Chancellor on the Brink of the Second Bailout for Banks,” highlighting the broken state of the global financial system.

Bitcoin’s promise has been to provide a decentralized means for storing and transferring value with predictable issuance rules. On paper, it looked like a perfect hedge for the next recession and hyperinflation, a new “digital gold.”

However, this value proposition didn’t hold up well in practice.

Bitcoin is slow and expensive. It’s quasi-decentralized, given that just a handful of mining pools control hashrates. It doesn’t offer smart contracts. The project’s proponents often cite the stock-to-flow (S2F) model and the halving events in attempts to justify BTC’s upside potential. Still, a limited supply is only one half of price growth. The other half is sustained demand.

With Bitcoin losing its ground as a macroeconomic hedge, it may struggle to generate organic demand down the road. Meanwhile, the blockchain space evolves, and other narratives may overshadow its place as “digital gold.”

The global risk-off environment led to countries rushing to reserve currencies. Outside of governments, people are hoarding cash⁠—even as the money printers continue to go “brrrr” in both the traditional and cryptocurrency sectors.

Stablecoins had a jump in issuance, from an aggregate market cap from around $5 billion to over $12 billion in just a few months. A surge in stablecoins suggests that people find them a better “safe haven” than Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) has been on the rise. DeFi platforms provide more attractive yields than their traditional counterparts, which are bound by near-zero interest rates.

The combination of stablecoins and DeFi instruments doesn’t leave many use cases for Bitcoin amid the global recession, especially given the scale of their recent expansion. However, data suggests that the increase in external demand didn’t trigger this expansion.

Bitcoin’s Unfulfilled Expectations

Bitcoin’s ability to act as a macroeconomic hedge has been evaluated using various approaches throughout its lifetime. The major shortcoming of these thought experiments is that there was no global recession since Bitcoin’s inception. Until now.

Klaus Grobys conducted one of the most recent studies of Bitcoin’s ability to act as gold. It uses a statistical technique called difference in differences. In its classic form, the method determines whether a drug works by observing two groups of people: those who took the drug and those who didn’t.

Grobys’s approach was to substitute the two groups of patients with the realized dynamic in BTC and S&P 500 correlation and the realized dynamic in gold and S&P 500 correlation.

The observations were divided by two timeframes: before the first patient announcement and after the global emergency announcement. In other words, Grobys wanted to see whether the recession “pill” affected Bitcoin’s performance.

Comparing BTC/S&P 500 and gold/S&P 500 realized correlations during the two periods, Grobys came to a disappointing conclusion. First, only gold had a statistically significant negative correlation with equities before the recession kicked in. Second, Bitcoin had a statistically higher correlation with S&P 500 after Mar. 11, when the global emergency was announced.

To put it simply, when stocks went south, gold’s correlation to them didn’t change much. Meanwhile, Bitcoin wasn’t performing well as a hedge in the first place and became more connected to equities as the downturn kicked in.

Bitcoin’s poor hedging performance carries implications for its core investment thesis. If it tanks during the global market’s decline, is it a good store of value? If not, BTC is worth little because its marginal utility is questionable.

Where Does Money Run When Things Go South?

The United States Dollar (USD) is a primary global reserve currency. It’s an essential link between all of the world’s economies, which is why banks outside of the U.S. have to hold a substantial amount of USD-denominated assets.

However, even these holdings turned out to be insufficient, mainly because this time, the banks weren’t at the epicenter of the rush for liquidity. In one of its latest bulletins, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) outlines how the situation around Money Market Funds (MMFs) contributed to the global dollar shortage.

MMF is a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term debt. They issue shares that can typically be redeemed for $1. For many market participants, it’s a good place to park money short-term.

Crucial to the recent spike in the global shortage of dollars are prime and government MMFs.

Prime MMFs invest in debt like Commercial Paper (CP) and Certificate of Deposits (CD), which are important vehicles for non-US banks to receive USD funding. Government MMFs invest in more liquid instruments, like cash and U.S. government securities, which makes their shares safer than those issued by prime MMFs.

An MMF’s shares can be redeemed for USD every day at the fund’s daily-close net asset value (NAV). To meet the redemption, the MMF has to have some free liquidity. While this would cause no problems under normal conditions, increased market uncertainty in March led to a liquidity squeeze.

As investors started to rush to the most liquid instruments, they prioritized the government MMFs over the prime ones because of what assets they kept on their balance sheets. Then they allocated redeemed assets to prime MMFs.

Massive redemptions forced prime MMFs to quickly liquidate their assets by offloading them to dealers, often at a discount. Consequently, there was a bank run-like situation where shareholders rushed to take their money out before a fund’s NAV dropped too low.

Meanwhile, dealers weren’t able or didn’t want to overextend their balance sheets, so CP and CDs started to pile up. As a result, prime MMFs couldn’t act like marginal lenders to banks and corporations by buying new debt.

The liquidity squeeze in MMFs caused longer-term interest to skyrocket. Even creditworthy banks had to agree to high-interest rates to get liquidity. LIBOR/OIS and TED spreads illustrate how much interest rates for 3-months USD loans diverged from overnight loans and T-bills in March 2020.

On Mar. 18, Fed’s Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility was announced to provide dealers with more USD to buy more assets from prime MMFs, which helped prime MMFs to rebalance their assets and ease the strain.

The key takeaway from the recent surge in USD shortage is that injecting more dollars into the system was necessary to keep it from breaking. There was such a strong demand for dollars that the U.S. Dollar index peaked despite a massive expansion of the U.S. Monetary Base.

The money printer went “brrrr,” but it was necessary because the global economic operations depended on USD. The global economy is a large interconnected organism. When many parties rush to liquidity, then the system may need interventions.

The Rise of Stablecoins

The crypto sector’s money printer was also busy. Starting in March, the total supply of stablecoins doubled.

What caused such an expansion? Flight-to-safety by market participants, interest from people outside the space, or the growth of DeFi?

In theory, stablecoins may be a better alternative for Bitcoin at times of the global market turmoil. They are liquid, stable, and cheap to move around. As a consequence, stablecoins may attract more new market participants than Bitcoin, which can’t be used as a hedge and features expensive and slow transactions.

Another point in favor of stablecoins is that they can be used for earning high annual percentage yields (APY). As people stay home and cut their expenses, the volume of personal savings increases, but the interest rates remain low. The newly emerged DeFi instruments have more attractive APYs, which may increase demand for stablecoins.

On paper, stablecoins can make Bitcoin an afterthought.

However, is there evidence of substantial demand for stablecoins? And, if there is, where does the demand come from? In other words, does the surge in the total supply of stablecoins signify that new users are joining the blockchain space?

The total trading volume aggregated from the top crypto spot markets shows that while there was some demand from the market’s retail participants, it wasn’t enough to justify printing billions of new USDT.

The USD/USDT volumes topped at $250 billion in April and have been declining ever since.

Google trends support that while there were some spikes in retail interest towards stablecoins, the search volumes were minuscule compared to those for “Bitcoin.”

Moreover, queries involving countries with volatile national currencies didn’t have much search volume, either.

A closer examination of on-chain USDT flows on Ethereum blockchain confirms the lack of retail demand. From Mar. 11, 2020, the majority of USDT went to one of Binance’s addresses. The exchange received over 26 billion USDT from only 177 thousand addresses and sent the same amount to only 216 thousand addresses.

Indeed these figures would suggest that instead of an uptick in retail USDT holders, the space is merely witnessing the back and forth exchange of various USDT whales.

The number of total addresses with non-zero USDT balance on Ethereum peaked at 1.81 million, which is too small to signify substantial demand for over 6 billion printed tokens. Daily active and new addresses tell the same story.

Finally, over 3 billion USDT (roughly 50% of the total supply printed on Ethereum) has been parked for at least a month, which points to a lack of activity, such as DeFi usage.

The total value locked on DeFi is $4.08 billion, and Maker dominance is 30.04%, which leaves only $2.85 billion TVL that can be accounted for stablecoins.

But as many know, there are far more assets locked in DeFi than just Tether’s stablecoin. This analysis would suggest that DeFi, despite becoming a hotspot for stablecoins, could never absorb the amount of USDT being printed.

Data from platforms like Compound shows that stablecoins are actively used there, given the fact that the most actively used markets generate the most COMP. However, the absolute values locked are too low to justify a multi-billion token issuance.

Overall, the data suggests that the blockchain space didn’t experience an influx of new users during the traditional market’s downturn. If that’s the case, what was the reason for issuing more stablecoins?

A plausible explanation was proposed in the recently released report by Bitstamp and CoinMetrics.

The report analyzed how stablecoins fluctuated in price and indicated that there was a brief moment in Spring this year, where stablecoins traded at a premium. This assumption is partially supported by the spike of USD/USDT trading volumes mentioned above.

The assumption made by the Bitstamp and CoinMetrics teams may also apply to some OTC trading. It made sense for stablecoin issuers to print and sell them at a premium, making free money.

It wouldn’t be the first time Tether issued USDT without a clearly established demand.

In their article titled “Is Bitcoin Really Untethered?,“ John Griffin and Amin Shams perform in-depth on-chain analysis to explore how USDT printed before the 2017-2018 bull run were moved around and allegedly used for market manipulation.

The major takeaway from Griffin’s and Shams’ work is that Bitcoin may have been pushed up by freshly minted USDT. With access to liquidity, Bitfinex and Tether could absorb the selling pressure from retail investors and move the prices higher.

This time, the motivation may be different, but the context of lacking organic demand is similar.

Is Bitcoin in Trouble?

In 2020, Bitcoin is pressed by several threats to its core value propositions. There’s a body of evidence that it’s not a good hedge, it’s inferior to expanding stablecoins as a payment rail, and it doesn’t have smart contracts to accommodate the DeFi hype.

On the other hand, Bitcoin still boasts a relatively high search volume, which showcases that its brand is still popular. Meanwhile, stablecoins and DeFi are yet to prove themselves as good proxies for bringing in new users.

Whether the world needs Bitcoin just because of its scarcity is an open question.

However, one thing is sure: the freshly minted stablecoins will, at some point, flow back into other digital assets and likely trigger a new large scale bull run.

On the latest episode of DataDash, Merten says a broad correction in the altcoin markets is offering investors a chance to hop in before the next big rally explodes. He says traders should keep an eye on the relative crypto newcomers Cardano (ADA) and Tezos (XTZ) in preparation for the next bullish breakout.

“Now that we have had this pullback here, [it] does provide an opportunity for some bulls who have missed out on a lot of this kind of exponential portion of the rally to get back in…

The major thing to focus on, as I think really a lot of the large caps and a lot of the established protocols, so some of the new emerging protocols, I know some of you are going to be excited for me to say this. Plays like Cardano, plays like Tezos, some of the other ones alongside some of the large caps like Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, this is going to be our major focus here.”

As for Litecoin, Merten says bulls will spark a new rally if they can capture a key level.

“Just like Bitcoin, just like Ethereum, building up long-term technical formations, Litecoin has very clear points of resistance and support. It looks like here, if you really take a look at the log chart, we just need to basically get above $70, we could really start to see this take off.”

Meanwhile, the crypto analyst is also long-term bullish on Ethereum. He believes the second-largest cryptocurrency will continue its hot streak en route to a new all-time high as long as the coin properly scales.

“It’s already built up support on previous resistance and broken out here… I think it’s going to continue to go up, eventually to set all-time highs and accelerate towards even higher levels.”

Key Takeaways Chainlink took a 21% nosedive, but managed to quickly recover.

Data shows that investors continue to accumulate LINK despite the recent price action.

If the buying pressure continues increasing, the decentralized oracles token may rise towards $11.

Chainlink’s uptrend has not been interrupted by the recent crypto market crash. Sidelined LINK investors appear to have bought the dip, which may lead to a further advance.

LINK Investors Buy the Dip

The past ten hours have been dramatic for LINK holders.

This cryptocurrency rose to a high of $8.5 on Aug. 1, but a few hours after the daily close, the crypto market crashed, taking Chainlink down with it. The decentralized oracles token took a 21% nosedive within 30 minutes, dropping to a low of $6.6.

Regardless of the erratic price action, investors appear to have taken advantage of it to accumulate more tokens.

Santiment’s holder distribution chart shows that as prices dropped, the buying pressure behind Chainlink surged substantially. The behavioral analytics firm registered a spike in the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10 million LINK.

As sidelined investors entered the market, prices were able to recover quickly. Consequently, LINK rebounded, soaring over 33% to make a higher high of $8.8.

Chainlink Aims for New Yearly Highs

When looking at LINK’s 1-day chart, it seems like its price bounced off the x-axis of a descending triangle. This technical formation is part of a bull flag that has been developing within this time frame since early July.

Although the new levels of volatility around Chainlink could have flushed out weak hands, it might be preparing to continue its uptrend. A further spike in demand for this altcoin may see it rise towards $11.

This target is determined by measuring the height of the flagpole and adding it to the breakout point.



IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model reveals that there isn’t any supply barrier ahead of this cryptocurrency that will prevent it from reaching its upside potential. Conversely, this on-chain metric suggests that several areas of interest may hold in the event of a correction.

Based on the IOMAP cohorts, the $7.7 support level might be able to absorb any downward pressure. Approximately 9,600 million addresses had previously purchased 9.5 million LINK around this level.

Holders within this price range would likely try to remain profitable in their long positions and buy more tokens to allow prices to rise as they did recently.

Given the recent levels of volatility, it is imperative to implement a robust risk management strategy when trading Chainlink or any other cryptocurrency. Now that the market seems to have entered a new bullish cycle, having cash ready to deploy is a must.

Early this morning, crypto markets almost universally experienced a price drop at around 5 am UTC. Yesterday’s crypto market rally was broken after the flash sale and markets have somewhat recovered and are now relatively stabilized.

Crypto Twitter is still catching on, with only a few users experiencing confusion about the situation.

How can the entire crypto market crash like that? — Sports Guy (@Jimbeamclassic) August 2, 2020

The markets crashing universally at the same time could be translated to trading bots reacting to arbitrage trading opportunities across exchanges. The uniform drop across most popular trading pairs (apart from stablecoins) leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

Let me know what you think by commenting on the following tweet.

There’s yet to be a real explanation, but looking at the charts, only stablecoins experienced gains at the same time, a signal that a whale pumped the markets, before promptly heading for the exit door. So, let’s look at the anomaly, i.e. stablecoins.

A quick look at WhaleAlert, a twitter account that reports on large crypto movements, we notice a strange phenomenon. Hours prior to the dump, approximately $52 mil USDT were transferred from Tether Treasury to Binance, and another $55 mil USDT was transferred from the treasury to Huobi.

This was followed by an issuance of a new batch of $250 mil USDT, at the treasury.

Find the rest of the WhaleAlert tweets at the end of the article.

Conveniently both Binance and Huobi are the exchanges that experienced the highest levels of USDT-related volume in the past 24 hours, showcasing them as the main price driver behind the action.

Was there foul play and market manipulation behind the rally and subsequent dump, or was this just an opportunity taken by a profit-hungry whale?

While there are hints pointing at an unholy partnership between iFinex (Tether), Binance, and Huobi in an effort to extract profits, there is no substantial proof on which we can make this claim.

On July 30, 2020, CoolBitX revealed that it has teamed up with BitPay, the leading provider of cryptocurrency payment services.

As mentioned in a release shared with CI:

“This partnership enables CoolBitX’s hardware wallet, CoolWallet S, to become the first hardware wallet in the market to fully integrate with the open source JSON Payment Protocol as an ongoing effort to facilitate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency.”

CoolWallet S users will now have the option of spending Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies at various retail outlets and to pay for products offered by corporations that currently support payments via BitPay – which includes AT&T, Twitch, Microsoft, Newegg, and many other businesses.

Michael Ou, CEO at CoolBitX, stated:

“This partnership with BitPay is not only a crucial landmark for CoolBitX, but for the wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as CoolWallet S users are now able to spend their cryptocurrencies on everyday items.”

Introduced in 2018, CoolWallet S combines hot (online) and cold (offline) digital asset storage solutions. The hardware wallet aims to take advantage of the convenience offered by hot cryptocurrency wallets and the high level of security features that should come with cold or offline digital wallets.

As noted in the announcement:

“With all its security features pared down to the size of a credit card, CoolWallet S is the world’s first hardware wallet that allows for Bluetooth-enabled pairing with users’ mobile phones.”

CoolWallet S integrates with Simplex and BANXA, which allows for credit card or direct fiat to cryptocurrency purchases via the CoolWallet S app. The wallet supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Horizen (ZEN), Binance Coin (BNB), and ERC-20 compliant tokens.

PlusToken, based in South Korea, was a ""high-yield"" investment program which offers traders high rates of returns when they store their digital funds on the platform.

China has been cracking down on illegal transactions related to virtual currency trading and has in recent years rolled out a string of regulation measures to guard against financial risks in this respect.

Last year, the country passed a national law on cryptography to regulate cryptography business and ensure the security of cyberspace and information.

These bad actors stole over 1.183 million Euros ($1.39M) from the service’s investment accounts in a cyberattack on July 31.

Ramon Ferraz Estrada, CEO of the crypto firm, revealed in a series of Twitter posts that the hack affected crypto investment accounts and exposed user passwords, though he noted that Euro accounts and wallets “are safe.”

To compensate for the stolen funds, 2gether has offered customers its native 2GT token at a price equivalent to 5 cents each. The 2gether team will also attempt to allocate additional funds to cover any remaining losses.

The crypto trading platform also stated that its app will be reestablished as soon as possible, “with all the security measures available.” The company will also hold an Ask Me Anything, or AMA, session on Reddit to clarify any doubts customers may have regarding the attack.

The U.K.-based cryptocurrency exchange Cashaa recently reported that more than 336 Bitcoin (BTC) were similarly stolen by hackers. The company has since ceased all crypto-related transactions, though users were reportedly not affected by this hack.

According to a profile in The New York Times, in 2019, hackers remotely seized control of a phone belonging to Gregg Bennett, a Seattle-based tech investor. They managed to steal 164 Bitcoins, which were worth $856,000 at the time and would be worth $1.8 million today. Bennett received an extortion note signed by Scrim, allegedly one of Clark’s online aliases.

In April, the Secret Service seized 100 Bitcoins from Clark, NYT reports. Weeks later, Bennett received a letter explaining that the Secret Service had recovered 100 of his Bitcoins. The letter cited the same code assigned to the coins seized from Clark. A Secret Service agent told Bennett that the person with the stolen Bitcoins was not arrested because he was a minor.

According to the NYT, less than two weeks after the Secret Service seized the 100 Bitcoins from Clark, he began working on the Twitter heist.

It appears Clark got his start as a cybercriminal by duping fellow Minecraft players into buying names or digital capes that he never provided. His interests then expanded to Fortnite, cryptocurrency and online hacker forums. By the time Clark was arrested for last month’s Twitter hack, he was living in his own Tampa apartment, complete with an expensive gaming setup. Neighbors said he drove a white BMW 3 Series, and he appeared on Instagram with items like designer sneakers and a gem-encrusted Rolex.

The fund has lost half its money since launching in 2017 and is in the process of refunding leftover money to investors, according to three people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.

The sources said the fund’s crypto-assets were liquidated in December and some cash is still being held up in escrow, months longer than expected.

By 2019, Neural Capital managed over $13 million that drew investments of $250,000 on up from over 40 investors, including Greylock partner Joshua Elman and Expa partner Hooman Radfar, according to financial records.

The fund withdrew its registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December and stopped submitting obligatory filings to the state of California and the federal agency this year.

It joins a horde of funds to close in 2020, shy of the three-year mark, after forming around the time of the 2017 crypto boom — notably, Adaptive Capital, Prime Factor Capital and Tetras Capital.

The fund’s managers, Arij “Ari” Nazir and Christopher Keshian, were new to the hedge fund industry and involved in more than one fund when they started Neural Capital.

Nazir was a University of Virginia master’s student who interned for the White House in the spring of 2015 during Barack Obama’s second presidential term.

Keshian, who graduated from the University of Virginia’s business school with Nazir in 2015, was chief executive officer of Decentralized Capital Corporation, a Panamanian fiat-to-crypto money transmitter, until 2017.

While managing the fund, Nazir and Keshian were advisors of Protocol Ventures, an institutional investor in multiple cryptocurrency funds that included Neural Capital, whose logo has been removed from Protocol’s website.

Keshian also started Apex Capital, a Protocol-like crypto fund-of-funds, with Joseph M. Bradley, Neural Capital’s head of investor relations, as they were getting Neural Capital off the ground. Apex Capital failed to launch after unsuccessfully attempting to raise $100 million in assets through a digital token sale to meet minimum invested fund amount requirements.

Keshian left Neural Capital in July 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile, after what the sources described as a falling-out with Nazir.

Keshian told CoinDesk he has not kept in touch with Nazir since leaving Neural Capital. “Right now, I’m working on a project that is still very much under wraps,” said Keshian, declining to comment further.

Indeed, the reigning smart contract platform’s developers are making great headway on the coming rollout of the major “Ethereum 2.0” upgrade, multiple talented teams are on the verge of breakout Layer 2 scaling solutions, and users are increasingly rushing to use Ethereum dApps for a wide variety of promising, and even unprecedented, activities.

Between DeFi, DEXs, DAOs, and NFTs, 2020 thus far has easily been a de facto “Year of Ethereum” in the cryptoeconomy. That said, let’s explore some key dynamics already pointing the way to a possible “Decade of Ethereum” in the years ahead.

Ethereum Settling More Value Than Bitcoin

At the beginning of June 2020, daily transaction fees on Ethereum overtook daily transaction fees on Bitcoin. Ethereum’s held the lead on that metric ever since.

That reality clearly indicates that demand to use Ethereum is on the rise. But there’s another metric that’s even more telling regarding how Ethereum is gaining on Bitcoin, and it’s daily settlement value.

Indeed, earlier in July cryptoeconomy data firm Messari noted how Ethereum has recently overtaken Bitcoin when it comes to daily settlement value, i.e. the total daily USD value of facilitated transactions atop a given blockchain. Simply put, Ethereum is now handling significantly more value than Bitcoin is, and that could be a self-reinforcing dynamic going forward. Ethereum has the most action so that’s where the most action is poised to go, so to speak.

Daily Active Users Boom

With so many things going on around the Ethereum ecosystem this year, there’s been no shortage of interesting activities to participate in. The variety of promising possibilities has accordingly led to a surge in active Ethereum users lately.

For example, active Ethereum addresses — addresses that send or receive ETH or ERC20 tokens on a daily basis — have doubled year-to-date (YTD) as of July. The number of such addresses is currently just shy of 600,000. Yet at this point, 1 million and beyond seems all but inevitable.

Smart Contract Calls Booming, Too

Ethereum smart contract activity is starting to explode, and there’s no indication the bustle is going to slow down any time soon.

Last week, crypto data provider Coin Metrics highlighted how on July 25th there had been over 3.1 million Ethereum contract calls, a new record for organic activity the blockchain. There’s still plenty of room for growth, to be sure, but supporting billions of dollars’ worth of activity is a great and legitimizing start.

DEX Volume at Unprecedented Levels

Decentralized exchange projects like Uniswap, 1inch, and Balancer are some of Ethereum’s brightest early stars, and the proof is in the numbers.

That’s because in July 2020, Ethereum’s rising DEX projects collectively powered over $4 billion in trades — all done permissionlessly, non-custodially, and 24/7. That $4 billion mark is a new monthly record for DEX volume, but with these exchanges just starting to take flight, this undoubtedly won’t be the last time that record’s extended.

Ethereum-Based Assets Shining

Notably, as of July Ethereum-based assets are the best-performing asset class so far in 2020 per data from Messari.

According to the firm, right now the average YTD gain for the nearly 180 Ethereum-backed assets considered was 130%, while 10 of those assets had YTD gains surpassing 500%.

The influx of buy pressure in recent months comes as governance tokens in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) sector like COMP, LEND, and SNX have been exploding in popularity. These tokens give users a seat at the DeFi table, as it were, while DeFi has been blooming.

DeFi Hits $4 Billion TVL

Popularized by DeFi Pulse, total value locked (TVL) is a metric that tracks the total USD value of assets locked in DeFi protocols. For folks from traditional finance, we can think of TVL like an assets under management (AUM) measurement.

The good news for Ethereum, then? Its DeFi sector is having something of a breakout year, as the arena collectively just hit the $4 billion TVL milestone this summer. That’s still small, relatively speaking, but what’s been impressive is the rate of growth: the $1 billion TVL mark was first crossed back in January 2020, meaning the DeFi TVL has quadrupled YTD.

And things are only beginning, as there’s still much more room for growth. Messari researcher Ryan Watkins recently highlighted how the top DeFi projects combined are still worth less than either Bitcoin Cash and XRP alone. It’s not that BCH and XRP don’t have anything to offer, rather they don’t offer the range of productive use cases that DeFi projects do, and thus they lack a certain magnetism. Look for both the DeFi TVL and the market cap of DeFi projects to climb in the years ahead accordingly.

The entirety of what we call DeFi is worth less than both XRP and Bitcoin Cash alone. Despite its rerating over the past couple months, DeFi is still extremely small in perspective. 1/ pic.twitter.com/rd4LZbDeu6 — Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) July 28, 2020

The Non-Fat Protocol

The “Fat Protocol Thesis” has been around the cryptoeconomy for a few years. The thrust of it is that base layers like Ethereum would accrue more value, i.e. be “fat,” than the “thin” layer of applications built atop them.

The argument seemed apt for years, but it’s being challenged more than ever courtesy of the Ethereum ecosystem. That’s because this summer, the combined market cap of all Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens overtook the market cap of Ethereum’s currency, ETH, for the first time ever.

This reality drives home the fact that Ethereum is powering a teeming economy in the here and now and that the platform is an increasingly promising avenue for app builders.

Ethereum + Bitcoin = Crypto Tour de Force

Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are collectively on pace to facilitate around $1.3 trillion in transactions this year. Trillion.

To this end, these blockchains are already historic and proven success stories, but there’s more to be done, and they can go farther together — at least for the foreseeable future. Bitcoin is a tank when it comes to its core use case and name recognition, and tokenized bitcoin projects on Ethereum can extend BTC to make it that much more flexible and productive and raise Ethereum’s profile. This kind of mutualism could lead to Bitcoin + Ethereum’s first $10 trillion.

Ethereum the Kid

What the Ethereum blockchain and the project’s community have been able to achieve to date is nothing short of incredibly impressive. But it’s also just barely started.

Indeed, on July 30th, 2020, Ethereum turned five years old. And if this is how far the project’s ecosystem can progress in just five short years, then the next five may prove to be absolute rippers for the platform and its blooming app layer. At the rate things are going, Ethereum could be a household name in ten years’ time.

Conclusion

If you’re into the cryptoeconomy, ignore Ethereum going forward at your own peril.

It’s not that other interesting projects won’t rise and fall in this space; it’s just that Ethereum is becoming a major gravity well of DeFi activity and in this regard it’s vastly ahead of all other platforms in the space. They have a lot of catching up to do, while Ethereum is only picking up speed lately.

Things are still early, of course. Ethereum still has plenty of growing to do. Yet with each passing day, it seems more and more inevitable that Ethereum’s ecosystem will do more than just rise to the occasion.",2020-08-03 12:36:08+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/banana-fund-crypto-ponzi-scheme,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to return $6.5 million in allegedly scammed bitcoin to victims of the “Banana.Fund” crowdfunding project, which the government described in court papers as a Ponzi scheme.

In a forfeiture suit against the cryptocurrency account storing the funds, prosecutors allege Banana.Fund’s unnamed administrator admitted to investors his project had flopped, promised to return $1.7 million to them and then failed to do so. The operator then pivoted to a laundering and refund scheme that ultimately resulted in the U.S. Secret Service’s (USSS) seizure of 482 bitcoin (BTC) and 1,721,868 tether (USDT).

The lawsuit, filed July 29 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks to grant the federal government formal ownership of the assets so it can return them to the victims.

The suit did not identify the operator of Banana.fund. But several victims of the alleged scam, and documents reviewed by CoinDesk, show the outfit was run by a British national named Richard Matthew John O’Neill aka “Jo Cook.”

One of the victims, Mike Koenen, told CoinDesk that since at least May 2018 he has been pushing the USSS to investigate Banana.Fund and O’Neill.

Documents reviewed by CoinDesk show that by November 2019, agents with the USSS San Francisco field office were email-canvassing likely victims for information on Richard O’Neill. Law enforcement had frozen O’Neill’s Poloniex account over a year before.

Neither O’Neill nor the Department of Justice responded to requests for comment.

The forfeiture suit represents perhaps the most substantial development yet in a little-known scheme that ran through the height of bitcoin’s historic late-2017 price pump and apparently went belly-up within months of the market’s pop, the documents reveal.

Peeling back the fraud

Banana.Fund’s white paper describes a crowdfunded business development company that shepherds fledgling startups through their earliest stages while offering operational transparency to their seed investors.

O’Neill told CoinTelegraph in January 2017 that Banana.Fund would “use blockchain for what it is good for: implementing transparent and irreversible global transactions.” In his view, he was “creating a level playing field for all users to pursue their business ideas, free of charge.”

Investing in O’Neill’s own business idea was not free of charge, however.

The buy-in started at 0.02 BTC, said Telegram user Dutch_Giant, who heard about Banana.Fund on the now-defunct message board MoneyMakersforum.

“The bigger deposit you made, the bigger part of the business you got,” Dutch_Giant said. He put in 0.024 bitcoin – “about $60 at the time.”

Other investors went even bigger on O’Neill’s crowdfunding darling, internal documents show. One user invested 82 bitcoin and nine others contributed 10 bitcoin or more. In all, 417 investors claim to have lost a combined 481 bitcoin, worth almost $5.5 million today, to Banana.Fund.

Those figures come from a spreadsheet of “verified refund claims” that O’Neill began compiling on Jan. 2, 2018, when he emailed Banana.Fund investors that they could be refunded nearly three times the dollar value of their original investment – but not their value in bitcoin.

“Banana.Fund is a failed project,” O’Neill said in a project announcement whose text was shared with CoinDesk and referenced in the criminal complaint. He claimed that while Banana.Fund had already spent around a third of investors’ $600,000 pie on overhead, he had ridden the remaining bitcoin through late 2017’s heights and could now refund them triple their original investment in USDT, a stablecoin that usually trades 1-for-1 with the dollar.

“We’ve failed up!” he said. He claimed to have $1,730,000 in USDT for refunds. “Pure dumb luck.”

His investors would have been far luckier had they never locked their bitcoin up in Banana.Fund, the DOJ points out. Banana.Fund’s founder, referred to in the suit only as “Person 1,” only “stated that due to the increased value of bitcoin, investors would receive more than their initial investment in U.S. dollars, although, realistically, they would all still lose money because of the increased value of bitcoin.”

A calculated risk

Prosecutors allege that “Person 1” had an account balance of $11 million and could therefore easily pay back even Banana.Fund’s biggest investors. They further allege that “Person 1” spent the weeks leading up to his USDT conversion “buying and selling multiple coins for personal gain” and attempted one withdrawal to buy a house.

O’Neill “literally gambled with our BTC on Poloniex and he had few good trades,” said another victim of the alleged scam, Kris Zelisko, who invested 1.01 bitcoin in Banana.Fund. “Also, BTC went up in the meantime.”

Prosecutors also allege “Person 1” engaged in a year-long bitcoin laundering scheme that spanned over 40,000 trades and seven different cryptos, and in a two-week spree generated $540,000 in profit from the Banana.Fund pot.

“Person 1” never paid the vast majority of investors back, the prosecutors alleged.

Dutch_Giant said that a number of Banana.Fund users were well aware of the risks involved with “Jo Cook” enterprises. “Cook,” he said, had a track record of operating crowdfunded-oriented website scams that nonetheless paid some investors out.",2020-08-03 09:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/travala-agoda-booking-revenue,"Disclosure

The largest cryptocurrency by market value continues to benefit alongside gold as the ongoing economic toll of the coronavirus raises expectations of further rescue packages and stimulus from central banks and governments. Gold, seen by many investors in traditional markets as a hedge against inflation, has been hitting new records and on Sunday was closing in on $2,000 an ounce.

The credit-rating firm Fitch on Friday placed a “negative outlook” on the United States’ triple-A rating, writing in a press release that a “resurgence of inflation” could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, “adversely affecting debt dynamics.”

“Paper money hit a low versus non-quantitatively-easible money like gold and bitcoin,” Dan Morehead, CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital, wrote last week in a monthly letter.

Bitcoin is now up 56% on the year, vastly outperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which is up 1.3% in 2020. The gauge of U.S. stocks rose 5.5% in July.

Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped 54% in July and is now trading around $380, its highest in two years. Ethereum has become the blockchain of choice for most of the biggest projects in DeFi, where decentralized lending and trading systems have now garnered some $4.2 billion in total value locked, quadruple the amount just two months earlier.

“All this hype surrounding DeFi has further fueled Ethereum’s rise,” Jay Hao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, wrote last week, noting that trading volumes had jumped on decentralized exchanges.

“Even if the DeFi bubble were to burst, it seems that it cannot quell the enthusiasm for ether,” Hao wrote. “In actual fact, it may bolster its price further as the capital flows from DeFi tokens back into ether.”

July’s top-performing digital asset, Chainlink’s LINK token, surged 70%.

As CoinDesk Senior Markets Reporter Daniel Cawrey detailed in First Mover on Friday, LINK represents the leading “oracle” – an automated price feed – for many DeFi applications built atop the Ethereum blockchain. And the role is potentially so lucrative that many other projects are now vying to grab market share in the oracle race.

Among the CoinDesk 20, the only tokens that didn’t post big price gains in July were the stablecoins tether and USDC, which by definition don’t move much because they’re pegged to the dollar.

It’s somewhat ironic, since the outstanding amount of stablecoins has grown rapidly, swelling past $12 billion.

“If you were in a stablecoin, you missed out the gains that bitcoin or ethereum or chainlink were giving,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital.

BTC: Price: $11,225 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,295 | 24-Hr Low: $10,956

Trend: Bitcoin’s bullish bias remains intact despite Sunday’s sudden flash crash.

The top cryptocurrency by market value was trading in the green near $11,225 at press time, having dropped by $1,400 to levels under $10,700 yesterday. The price slide erased (or engulfed) the uptick seen in the preceding four trading days.

Bearish engulfing candles like that formed Sunday are widely considered early signs of an impending bearish reversal. However, the drop looks to be nothing more than a healthy pullback, which often occur after a notable rally.

Bitcoin rose by $2,900 in the 11 days to Aug. 31, pushing the widely tracked 14-day relative strength index into overbought territory above 70. As such, a pullback was likely and expected. In the past, bitcoin has seen bigger price drops during bull runs.

“The latest bitcoin pullback was only 15%. There were at least six pullbacks of 30%+ or more last bull market uptrend,” popular analyst Josh Rager tweeted early Monday.

And while Sunday’s sell-off was the biggest single-day decline since May 10, it failed to take out the former hurdle turned-support of $10,500 (February high). Prices closed (UTC) well above that level on Sunday, confirming a bullish breakout for the week.

Looking ahead, a re-test of $12,000 cannot be ruled out, as the 14-day RSI has rolled over to under-bought (or bullish) territory below 70.00. Upward momentum looks strong with the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) trending north.

The bullish outlook would only be invalidated if the cryptocurrency establishes a strong foothold under $10,500.",2020-08-03 12:22:20+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-firm-hacked-admits-struggle-reimburse-users,"Disclosure

According to a July 31 tweet from crypto community members and brothers Aaron and Austin Arnold, their Altcoin Daily channel with 214,000 subscribers was terminated by YouTube for “encouraging illegal activities.”

“We are a news/opinion channel,” the two said on Twitter. “We have never promoted anything illegal. Appeal has been submitted.”

The brothers reached out to Altcoin Daily’s 27,700 Twitter followers urging them to contact YouTube and request reinstatement, using hashtags including #FreeAltcoinDaily.

After more than two days in which the channel content was completely inaccessible to subscribers, Altcoin Daily reported on August 3 that the YouTube had reversed the ban.

Targeting crypto channels

YouTube aggressively deleted videos with content related to cryptocurrency in December 2019. Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers or more including Chris Dunn’s had videos removed, while Crypto Beadles Robert Beadles’ page was removed entirely. YouTube referred to one of these bans as “an error” during the review process.

In June, the platform shut down the official channel of cryptocurrency news-focused website Bitcoin.com for “a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.” After an appeal, the channel with all 40,000 subscribers was restored two days later. Other crypto content creators had their channels reinstated after 24 hours offline, including Tone Vays and BTC Sessions, a blockchain-based YouTube channel.

A government official has reportedly confirmed that a “note” regarding the legal framework for cryptocurrency in India has been forwarded to related ministries for inter-ministerial discussions. It would then be presented to the cabinet for approval.

Status of Indian Crypto Bill

India’s cryptocurrency bill is back in the limelight on Tuesday after Moneycontrol reported on a “note” that seeks to “ban trade in cryptocurrency,” citing an unnamed government official. On the condition of anonymity, the official explained that the Indian government has been holding consultations with the law ministry, the ministry of information and technology, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on a framework for a law that will “formally end trading in cryptocurrency in India,” the publication conveyed.

“We have forwarded a note to related ministries for inter-ministerial discussions … We are working on it,” he added, elaborating:

After inter-ministerial consultations, it (the note) would be presented to the cabinet for approval. Once Parliament resumes for the session, we are hoping to get it ratified.

“There was a view in the government that banning it through a law would be more binding. It will clearly define the illegality of the trade,” the government official was quoted as saying.

This is not the first time the media has reported that the Indian government is planning to ban cryptocurrency, and it is also not the first time such a note has been discussed. In June, the Economic Times reported that “India is looking to introduce a law to ban cryptocurrencies” based on a note that “has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultation.”

However, crypto exchange executives told news.Bitcoin.com that a blanket ban is unlikely considering much has developed since the crypto bill was submitted to the finance ministry early last year. The bill was drafted by the inter-ministerial committee headed by former Finance and Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, who has now retired from government. He recently said that cryptocurrencies can be regulated as commodities. The executives said Indians are generally undeterred by crypto ban news as they are waiting for the government to make a formal announcement.

In addition, a recent DEA’s reply to a Right to Information (RTI) application suggested that the government is not entirely happy with the existing bill. Lawyer Mohammed Danish of Crypto Kanoon explained that “If the govt. decides to pass a law banning crypto, this law can be challenged by crypto business, traders, or enthusiasts based on various rights available to them under the Constitution.”

Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry in India has been growing substantially ever since the supreme court quashed the circular by the central bank that banned banks from providing services to crypto businesses. Local crypto exchanges have reported as much as 10x trading volume growth and a significant increase in the number of signups.

Elizabeth Ralston began working remotely as Bison Trails’ first in-house lawyer last month, she told Bloomberg Law. The move comes eight months after the company—founded in October 2018 and backed by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins—raised nearly $26 million in a Series A funding round led by Blockchain Capital LLC and Coinbase Ventures, an affiliate of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Inc.

In July, Coinbase recruited Paul Grewal, a former deputy general counsel at Facebook Inc. Grewal’s hire was the latest in a string of notable in-house additions in the cryptocurrency space, where companies have sought to ramp up their legal and compliance efforts to bolster their credibility with regulators and other financial services institutions.

“As a young and growing industry, it’s important that members engage with global policymakers to help educate and influence the regulations and policies that will undoubtedly have an effect on our future,” Bison Trails founder and CEO Joe Lallouz said in a statement touting Ralston’s hire.

Ralston spent four years at Goldman, working her way up from analyst to vice president in the company’s legal department. She comes to Bison Trails after two-and-a-half years as the sole in-house lawyer at BlockTower Capital Advisors LP. The Stamford, Conn.-based cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm was started in 2017 by former Goldman investment manager Matthew Goetz.

Ralston was BlockTower’s legal and compliance director, a role that saw her handle fund formation and regulatory work, as well as negotiate numerous agreements with other cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, OTC desks, and software and service providers.

Lallouz touted Ralston’s experience at BlockTower navigating an emerging regulatory environment for digital currencies. He said Ralston “will help drive strategy and operations as they intersect with risk, legal, policy, and compliance.”



Regulatory Wrangling

Bison Trails is a member of Libra and the Celo Alliance for Prosperity, a rival global cryptocurrency group seeking to use digital assets as a means of increasing financial access and inclusion.

Ralston declined to discuss Bison Trails’ involvement in those organizations, which have attracted the attention of regulators over their efforts to broaden the appeal of virtual currencies.

In May, Libra hired financial crimes compliance expert Robert Werner as general counsel, a move that followed Libra’s addition of CEO Stuart Levey, Werner’s former colleague at the Treasury Department and HSBC Holdings PLC .

Ralston said she’ll be doing some policy work at Bison Trails to try and clear the regulatory cloud that surrounds cryptocurrencies. Gunderson Dettmer has been a primary legal adviser to Bison Trails early on, said Ralston, adding she expects to reach out to other law firms to help her engage regulators.

“There are a lot of good actors in the space who want to do the right thing,” Ralston said. “We want to educate regulators and advocate for the industry by coming up with a good regulatory framework that protects the public interest.”

One key regulator is Brian Brooks, a former legal chief at Coinbase who now serves as acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ralston’s praised Brooks’ appointment, noting she hopes his in-house background at Coinbase “gives other regulatory agencies more comfort that there are legitimate people working in this space.”

The digital currency arena got a boost in late July when the OCC said that licensed U.S. banks and savings associations can hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple for their customers.

“It’s a really important technology,” Ralston said. “It would be really unfortunate if the regulatory environment quashes this industry and doesn’t allow it to progress.”



Other Crypto Openings

Ralston, who jokingly noted she’s paid in cash, not cryptocurrency, joins other new legal chiefs hired this summer at cryptocurrency-focused outfits like BlockFi Inc. and Paradigm Operations LP.

Anchorage Hold LLC, a cryptocurrency custodian backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and blockchain payments company Circle Internet Financial Ltd., both of whom saw their former general counsels recently depart for two separate fintech companies, are looking for new top lawyers.

Paxos Trust Co. LLC, a cryptocurrency startup that earlier this year hired former WeWork Cos.

Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchanged owned by Payward Inc. that hired a new legal chief in April, is looking to hire an associate litigation counsel.

Flooded Market

China’s severe flooding, the worst in decades, hasn’t overwhelmingly impacted the bitcoin mining industry – but it’s still a difficult rainy season. Johnson Xu, chief analyst at Beijing-based research startup TokenInsight, said most mining facilities have chosen spots outside of flood plains. However, factors like bitcoin’s increased hashrate, lower price and the oversupply of bitcoin miners in the region have led to a daily revenue drop of 70% compared to last year. China’s bitcoin miner operations account for 65% of the global multi-billion dollar industry.

Ripple said it sold $32.55 million of its XRP cryptocurrency during Q2 2020, a 1,760% jump over Q1’s sales figures and the first signs of XRP sales growth in nearly a year. According to its most recent quarterly report, over-the-counter (OTC) XRP sales surged, spurred in part by liquidity-providing integrations with telco Swisscom Blockchain, swap execution facility Zero Hash and the crypto bank Sygnum. Average daily volume slumped to 196 million from Q1’s 322 million. Ripple’s programmatic sales program – made directly to exchanges – is still on pause.

Back Backed

Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Blockstream CEO Adam Back participated in a $3.1 million private security token offering (STO) for the online strategy game “Infinite Fleet.” The game is ​developed by Pixelmatic, founded by Samson Mow, who is also CSO at Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream. Announced Friday, the round was broken into two parts, with $2.75 million raised via Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs) and $250,000 raised through the investment platform BnkToTheFuture.

Yuan Over Yon?

Digital currency should replace fiat in China’s financial systems, according to a former vice president at Bank of China, one of the nation’s four biggest state-owned commercial banks. The executive, Yongli Wang, said over WeChat that wide use of digital currencies would encourage monetary reform, bolster liquidity and place limits on excessive cash issuance. Wang, now a director of the Haixia Blockchain Research Institute, also said limiting digital currency as a replacement for cash could impact its market competitiveness. China is in the process of developing and testing a digital yuan through its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) system.

SegWit Sleuths

NetWalker ransomware, which last week triggered cybersecurity flash warnings from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has extorted $25 million in bitcoin from its corporate and governmental victims during the months of the pandemic, according to a report by McAfee and CipherTrace. NetWalker is a “ransomware-as-a-service” that gains its access through COVID-19 phishing emails, steals internal documents and demands a payout. Approximately 2,795 bitcoins have been transferred to NetWalker wallet addresses beginning March 1, with evidence showing hackers are swapping this extorted payout into cold storage and SegWit addresses, possibly to reduce fees.

At stake

Cryptocurrency and security token exchange INX is continuing with its plans to go public – as one of the largest offerings (within the digital assets industry) to date.

According to an updated F-1 Form (the Securities and Exchange Commission prospectus form for foreign issuers), the Gibraltar-based firm is looking to raise a maximum of $117 million. If successful, that would be $27 million more than mining giant Canaan made when it went public in 2019, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports.

Initial public offerings are rare in the industry, but becoming more common. Silvergate Bank and Argo Mining, among others, led the way with others soon to follow. Both Coinbase and Diginex are expected to appear on Nasdaq – through unconventional channels. INX’s plan is also unconventional, with the raise being led through a token sale. The firm will offer 130 million INX tokens at $0.90 each, with investors able to purchase INX tokens with USDC, bitcoin and ether – under certain restrictions – as well as the U.S. dollar. The token is used to pay transaction fees on the platform.

In years prior, token sales were largely unregistered initial coin offerings, which led to a slew of problems still being meted out. Chief among them, the debate over whether token holders have rights over a company or protocol.

While INX holders won’t be equity holders, they will receive a share of the firm’s profits. Further, in the advent of a liquidation, token holders will be paid ahead of shareholders.

While going public isn’t an option for the majority of crypto firms, this arrangement shows a new path forward for crypto’s integration with the larger financial system. The ability to use cryptographically secure tokens to confer benefits to stakeholders, while also providing benefit to the platform.

INX’s executive managing director, Alan Silbert, is the brother of Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.

As the filing shows, INX plans to use the IPO funds to build its digital platform.

UPDATE: (August 14, 16:30 UTC): This section has been updated to show the IPO target has not been lowered, as originally reported.

Taking the Economy Back From Economists

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, is best known for her attempts to enter New York politics as a progressive advocate. She recently published, “BREAK ‘EM UP: Recovering Our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money,” about the monopolization of American industry and the antitrust actions being pursued. What follows is an abridged conversation with Teachout and CoinDesk privacy reporter Ben Powers. Read the full Q&A here.

How do monopolistic companies create parallel government structures?

There are clearly forms of private government that are smuggled inside our current public government and growing in power. If you ask somebody who is an Amazon seller what judicial system they care about, they care a lot about Amazon’s system and their own mechanisms for delisting sellers. These companies have their own intellectual property regime, their own punishment regime, and that is as important if not more so than the public one if you are caught within the web of one of these private, growing governments.

You bring up decentralization a lot in the book. How might cryptocurrencies play a role in that?

I think of these systems as incredibly important, but it all depends on what the governance mechanism is. When Amazon recently applied for a patent to use blockchain technology, which would basically require every seller to keep a ledger of where all their supplies come from, then basically the technology itself isn’t doing a lot of decentralization. The technology is in service of a centralized power. There is no such thing as no-governance regimes. When I talk to crypto advocates, they’ll often frame it as if it is a world with no governance. But there is never an absence of governance. In the end, someone controls supply. Technology itself can’t do quite as much work as I think some of the advocates think. But again, let’s have that discussion, because I think there’s just unbelievably powerful ways in which it can be used for the good.

You talk about developing a “f–k-off” economy. What do you mean by that?

I’m trying to take the economy back from the economists. They’ve been acting like priests for 40 years and telling us that we, as mere residents of this society, have no business messing with economic terms like monopoly or antitrust, and we should just trust their assessments of efficiency. When you take the economy back for people and not economists, then things like wages matter again.

Just because you’re not bullish doesn’t mean you can’t respect Bitcoin. CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen sits down with Nadia Eghbal, author of the upcoming book “Working in Public,” about open-source software projects.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-08-04 16:05:00+00:00,https://www.techradar.com/news/crypto-exchange-shapeshift-launches-mobile-app-for-self-custody-trading,"Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has launched a mobile app that enables users to buy, sell, and transfer digital currencies using their smartphone

ShapeShift looks to stand apart from its competitors by allowing users to control the encryption keys for their own digital wallets in what is know as a self-custody wallet.

That’s a sharp contrast from mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, which take custody of users’ wallets and control the encryption keys. ShapeShift never knows or retains access information for users’ wallets, placing the burden of security on individual traders.

Self-custody wallets

ShapeShift already offered a similar exchange platform through its web interface, but the new trading app meets many crypto users where they are: on their mobile devices.

“With one email and password users can enjoy self-sovereign finance on both web and mobile,” says ShapeShift founder Erik Vorhees. “We're here to make it easy.""

The self-custody model has proven appealing to cryptocurrency users as hacks have increasingly focused on exchanges that host users’ digital wallets. In April, hackers stole $25 million in assets from users on the DForce exchange, and ShapeShift was hacked in 2016, but no user funds were stolen since its exchange doesn’t retain keys for any users’ encrypted wallets.

Self-custody wallets are also gaining in popularity since they are required for a wide range of blockchain-based financial applications.

While exchanges with hosted wallets can buy and sell crypto on a user’s behalf, hosted wallets are walled off from most of the blockchain-based financial ecosystem. Financial transactions such as purchasing decentralized insurance, making blockchain-based loans, and trading crypto derivatives all require a self-custody wallet.",2020-08-04 15:56:21+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-as-fed-nears-inflation-rubicon-analysts-see-50k-bitcoin-in-play,"The Federal Reserve appears ready to pursue yet another untested strategy that could ultimately boost inflation – and possibly prices for bitcoin.

The Fed is “preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation,” according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal.

The shift signals an explicit willingness by the central bank to tolerate higher inflation, at a time when the spreading coronavirus continues to ravage the economy. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 11%, a level not witnessed since the early 1940s until this year.

The Fed’s extra loosening of monetary policy could help support prices for bitcoin, which many cryptocurrency investors speculate could serve as an effective hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Bitcoin prices have already soared 58% this year, beating silver’s 36% and gold’s 30%, not to mention the 2% gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large stocks.

Bitcoin rose 1.5% on Monday to $11,338.

“As more investors look to ‘digital gold’ as an inflation hedge in an increasingly digitized world amidst unprecedented government money printing,” the cryptocurrency research firm Messari wrote Monday, “we know that it won’t take much of an institutional allocation until $50,000 bitcoin is back on the table.”

The Fed already has taken monetary policy to a new level of extraordinary this year, pumping nearly $3 trillion of freshly created money into financial markets earlier and pushing its total assets to about $7 trillion. A growing number of investors in both digital-asset and traditional markets say the flood of dollars could whittle down the U.S. currency’s purchasing power.

The dollar index, a gauge of the the currency’s strength in foreign exchange markets, fell 4% in July, the biggest monthly drop since 2010. And the Wall Street brokerage firm Jefferies now predicts that the dollar could fall as much as 15%, according to CNBC.

Bank of America analysts wrote Monday in a report that it’s becoming a popular trade to bet against the dollar, since investors are “worried about the long-term impact of the rapid accumulation of U.S. debt for the U.S. dollar’s reserve-currency status.”

“As gold, silver, equities, and long bonds reach record high levels, and the U.S. dollar slumps, the king of cryptocurrencies may be back in the spotlight for the foreseeable future,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused firm Arca, wrote Monday in a weekly blog.

Under the Fed’s policy shift, according to the Wall Street Journal, the central bank would allow inflation to drift above a 2% target before raising rates. The idea is that above-target inflation would offset periods where consumer price increases were previously below the mark, as has been the case for most of the past two decades.

The goal is not to increase inflation per se, but to provide assurances to investors that interest rates would remain low for a long time, according to the paper. Such accommodation could help to assure a faster economic recovery.

Yet, higher inflation could further distort already uncanny signals emanating from bond markets, further undermining the dollar’s attractiveness. Nominal yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds are currently around 0.6%, close to historic lows. Once inflation is factored in, the “real yields” equate to negative 1%.

Assuming nominal yields don’t rise much anytime soon, an inflation rate above 2% would cause bond investors to fall even further behind.

“Negative real rates imply a loss in purchasing power from holding U.S. Treasuries, the ideal conditions for non-income producing assets such as gold and silver but also crypto assets like bitcoin,” the analysis firm Delphi Digital wrote on July 31.

There’s some risk that a fresh panic in markets might prompt investors to rush back into dollars, which could mean a redux of the March crash in bitcoin prices.

But according to an Aug. 2 Bloomberg News story, the next “risk-off scenario” might not see investors rushing into dollars, due to the “flood of liquidity unleashed by the Fed.”

“Any haven rally is likely to be shallower than in previous years,” according to the report, “while the possible extent of depreciation remains the same.”

“Everything hinges on the dollar right now,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in an email to subscribers.

BTC: Price: $11,186 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,480 | 24-Hr Low: $11,164

Trend: Bitcoin is again struggling to find a foothold above $11,400 amid signs of buyer exhaustion on the three-day chart.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $11,290, having hit a high of $11,424 during the Asian trading hours. Tuesday is the second straight day of bull failure above $11,400. Prices hit a high of $11,480 on Monday, but printed a UTC close below $11,240.

Essentially, bitcoin’s recovery rally from Sunday’s “flash crash” low of $10,659 has stalled with the area above $11,400 acting as stiff resistance.

The bulls need quick progress now, or the focus would shift to the uptrend exhaustion signaled by a major doji candle seen on the three-day chart.

A doji occurs when prices see two-way business during a specific period. While it is usually considered a sign of indecision, in this case, it has appeared following a notable rally to 11-month highs above $12,100. As such, it represents buyer fatigue.

The three-day chart’s relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 reading. Thus, a pullback to $11,000 can’t be ruled out. A move below that psychological support would expose the former hurdle-turned-support at $10,500 (February high).

Alternatively, a sustained move above $11,400 on the hourly chart would strengthen the case for a re-test of recent highs above $12,000.",2020-08-04 12:56:33+00:00,https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2020/08/04/tampa-teen-accused-of-profiting-from-twitter-hacks-pleads-not-guilty/,"TAMPA — Obscure social media platforms, a hacked database and drivers license photos.

These are the crumbs that led federal agents to the illegal sale of celebrities’ Twitter accounts — Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Kanye West among them — and the arrest of a Tampa teen investigators call the “mastermind” of the operation, according to new court documents obtained by the Tampa Bay Times.

Graham Ivan Clark, 17, is accused of gaining access to the Twitter accounts and sending tweets soliciting others to send in payments of Bitcoin, the hard-to-track cryptocurrency that stores transaction data on the blockchain — a decentralized public ledger. Prosecutors say Clark promised any Bitcoin sent in would be returned doubled. In all, Clark reaped $117,000 over about three hours, prosecutors said.

Clark, 17, a student at Gaither High School until last January, pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday in Hillsborough Circuit Court. He is scheduled for a bail hearing Wednesday, where his attorneys will argue for reduced bail. He remains in jail on $725,000 bail. He faces 30 charges and, if convicted, could spend up to 200 years in prison.

Two other suspects face related charges in a California federal court — Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, and Mason Sheppard, 19, of the United Kingdom. On the social media platform Discord, which has its roots in the world of online gaming, the two are known as Rolex#0373 and ever so anxious#001.

Fazeli and Sheppard operated as brokers for Discord user “Kirk#5270,” who claimed he worked for Twitter in private messages obtained by federal agents.

Kirk#5270 told the two he would access and take control of Twitter accounts in exchange for Bitcoin transfers. Fazeli and Sheppard agreed to post Kirk’s offer on OGUsers, a forum and marketplace popular with hackers.

The federal charges don’t identify Kirk#5270 and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California declined to provide a real name to the Times. Graham Clark, the Tampa teen, does not appear by name in the federal charges.

The Juvenile Delinquency Ac, a federal law, favors referring juveniles to state court, especially in cases that don’t involve violent or drug-related crimes.

OGUsers, it turns out, was hacked in April, and its data was posted on the internet — public forum postings, private messages, internet addresses and email addresses. The FBI downloaded the data and agents tracked accounts linked to Fazeli and Sheppard.

They found transactions made by the two over Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. Coinbase provided agents photos of drivers licenses belonging to Fazeli and Sheppard, one from Florida and one from the United Kingdom. Coinbases requires photo ID to confirm account holders’ identities.

Fazeli faces a charge of computer intrusion, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Sheppard faces charges of computer intrusion, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money, which collectively are punishable by up to 45 years in prison and a $750,000 fine.

Last week’s arrest was just the latest in a series of accusations that Clark has stolen Bitcoin, according to documents in his Hillsborough circuit case. Clark was the subject of an investigation last year involving prosecutors in Hillsborough County and Santa Clara, Calif.

No charges resulted, but in April, Clark surrendered $900,000 worth of Bitcoin to victims, Hillsborough prosecutors said in court documents filed with the Twitter case. The remainder of Clark’s Bitcoin balance was frozen for 11 days, then he transferred it to a different account “in an effort to disguise his new criminal ventures,” prosecutors wrote.

“Sim swapping” is a scam where the cell phone provider is tricked into switching one person’s phone number to a phone owned by the scammer. Using that information, one could siphon personal information and money.

Clark’s history with sim swapping, first reported by the New York Times, was detailed in court documents filed this week by his attorney and prosecutors. They show he was the target of a sim swapping investigation by authorities in Florida and California.

Those revelations were the subject of a bail reduction hearing Wednesday requested by the defense to convince the court to reduce the 17-year-old’s $725,000 bail. He has been in the Hillsborough County jail since Friday, when he was arrested on charges that he reaped about $117,000 by accessing the Twitter accounts of prominent celebrities and companies and to solicit payments of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

The July 15 Twitter hack of accounts like Barack Obama and Kim Kardashian gained national media attention and so has Clark’s arrest. That notoriety brought unwanted attention to Wednesday’s virtual Zoom hearing, which was was “Zoom bombed” — provocateurs broke into the call to interrupt the proceedings. Posing as CNN and BBC News, they repeatedly interrupted the meeting with rap music, movie dialogue and shouting.

Then Hillsborough Circuit Judge Christopher Nash temporarily shut down the hearing after all of the participants’ screens were taken over by pornography.

Clark gained access to Twitter’s systems by convincing an employee he worked in the company’s information technology department, according to the arrest report produced by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Clark then had the employee provide credentials that Clark could use to access Twitter’s customer service portal.

Clark’s defense attorney, David Weisbrod, filed a motion seeking to reduce his client’s bail and overturn a court ruling Saturday that the teen must prove any funds used to post bail were obtained legitimately.

Weisbrod said that last year Clark was the subject of a sim swapping investigation that involved prosecutors from Hillsborough County and Santa Clara, Calif. A search warrant was executed at Clark’s home in Greater Northdale in August 2019, where agents seized about $15,000 in cash and electronic devices.

Sim swapping is most effective when the target is using two-factor authentication, said San Francisco tech executive Rob Ross, who created the website stopsimcrime.org after he fell victim to a sim swap scam in 2018. Two-factor authentication is a system where online passwords cannot be changed without the user receiving passwords or codes texted to their phone. Thus a hacker could figure out their passwords, but wouldn’t be able to change them and access the accounts without those texts.

But if a sim swapper can convince a cell phone carrier to switch the target’s cell number to a phone owned by the swapper, then they can use those texts to reset the target’s banking, email and social media accounts.

The scheme has become more frequent due to a “perfect storm” of factors, said Ross, who lost about $1 million in the fraud. Smartphones and text-message two-factor authentication have both become commonplace.

The third factor is the rise in value of Bitcoin: Each Bitcoin is currently worth more than $11,000, giving hacker a financial incentive to sim swap.

Ross isn’t familiar with Clark’s background, but said most sim swappers are in their teens or early 20s, and many get their start by hacking shoot ‘em up video games like “Call of Duty” or “Fortnite” to up their kills.

“The hackers grow up in this virtual world and they graduate from figuring out how to cheat to maybe doing credit cards to doing sim swapping,” Ross said.

Clark developed a reputation in video games “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” as an “adept scammer,” according to the New York Times.

During the 2019 investigation, agents froze a Bitcoin account used by Clark. The defense attorney said that account had about $1 million worth of Bitcoin. On Saturday, he told the court that authorities at one time had seized another $3 million worth of the cryptocurrency.

In April, investigators agreed to return Clark’s assets, Weisbrod said, but held onto about $1 million worth of Bitcoin from the frozen account. The attorney said Florida and California prosecutors both agreed not to pursue charges against the 17-year-old.

A 17-year-old Tampa teen was behind the Twitter hack that gave him access to the accounts of Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many other celebrities with millions of followers, authorities say. [ Screengrab ]

Weisbrod called the $725,000 bail — more than six times the amount Clark is accused of stealing — “disproportionate.” He argued that the Second District Court of Appeal has ruled that courts cannot hold defendants for the purpose of determining the source of bail funds. Nevertheless, he argued, the fact that $3 million was returned to Clark by investigators in 2019 legitimized those funds, otherwise authorities would still have them.

In a response to Weisbrod’s bail reduction motion, Hillsborough Assistant State Attorney Darrell Dirks argued in an opposing motion to keep the provision that Clark must prove the legitimacy of his funds. He wrote that last year Clark was the subject of a federal and California investigation into the alleged theft of about $1 million in cryptocurrency from California victims. Clark agreed to pay $900,000 worth of cryptocurrency as “partial restitution” to California victims, the motion said.

The New York Times linked Clark to the theft of Bitcoin from Seattle tech investor Gregg Bennett and that the U.S. Secret Service recovered 100 Bitcoin from Clark.

“Any attempt to suggest that this agreement should be read that prosecutors, here or in California, concluded that Defendant was not involved is incorrect and misleading,” Dirks wrote.

Santa Clara County District Attorney Erin West declined to comment on Wednesday on the case, writing in an email that she cannot discuss a juvenile case. Clark was 16 when he was investigated by California authorities.

Dirks argued in court on Wednesday that $725,00 bail was appropriate because the losses in the case are not necessarily limited to $117,000. The prosecutor also wrote that Clark’s “successful attempt to hijack the funds” took place little more than two weeks ago.

“We are still discovering the breadth and extent of the defendant’s criminal conduct,” Dirks said in court.

Weisbrod argued that believing the damages may be higher “isn’t good enough.”

The judge split the difference. After a brief hiatus that he hoped would discourage the trolls (the Zoom interruptions continued) Nash said he would not change the bail amount. But he axed the provision that Clark must prove he legitimately obtained the funds he uses to post bail.

The court this past weekend also forbade Clark from using the Internet. Weisbrod asked Wednesday that his client be allowed to go online to access his Bitcoin assets to post bail. That request was denied.

Retail investors are split down the middle by generation over their favorite alternative assets, according to a note from JPMorgan this week.

Older investors are more inclined towards gold, while millennials are flocking to bitcoin, analysts from the bank said.

""The two cohorts show divergence in their preference for 'alternative' currencies,"" a team of analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. ""The older cohorts prefer gold while the younger cohorts prefer bitcoin.""

Both gold and bitcoin exchange-traded-funds have experienced strong inflows in the past five months, as both age groups see the potential in alternative currencies, the note said.

Millennials also have a particular fancy for stocks, especially ones in technology, but the older investors are selling equities, the team wrote in a note dated August 4.

""Younger cohorts of US retail investors show little interest in bond funds,"" they said, adding that ""they also avoid equity funds, preferring to invest in equities directly by buying individual stocks, especially tech stocks.""

""The older cohorts continued to deploy their excess liquidity into bond funds, the buying of which remained strong during both June and July,"" they wrote.

The parallel buying of US equities and bitcoin by millennials has increased the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 index since March, JPMorgan said.

The ""simultaneous flow support has caused a change in the correlation pattern between bitcoin and other asset classes, with a more positive correlation between bitcoin and gold but also between bitcoin and the dollar as US millennials see bitcoin as an 'alternative' to the dollar,"" the note said.

About a month and a half after I wrote about bitcoin legitimacy, CompTIA SmartBrief ran this headline: “PayPal shows more signs of entering cryptoindustry.” Apparently, PayPal is looking at embracing cryptocurrency within the next few months.

PayPal is a household name in the payments industry, and so is Visa, which recently announced:

“Visa has been working closely with licensed and regulated digital currency platforms like Coinbase and Fold to provide a bridge between digital currencies and our existing global network of 61 million merchants. Around the world, more than 25 digital currency wallets have linked their services to Visa, giving users an easy way to spend from their digital currency balance using a Visa debit or prepaid credential — anywhere Visa is accepted.”

Mastercard made a similar announcement in their shift toward embracing cryptocurrencies:

“Mastercard [on July 20] announced the expansion of its cryptocurrency program, making it simpler and faster for partners to bring secure, compliant payment cards to market. Supercharging the partnership experience, cryptocurrency and crypto card partners are invited to join Mastercard’s Accelerate program2 for emerging brands and fintechs, giving them access to everything they need to grow quickly.”

Visa and Mastercard are popular payment options. The two companies are present in every country on this notable list, in addition to 9 million US businesses. It is not outlandish to believe that bitcoin ATMs supported by these larger companies may soon be a reality.

Allowing a customer to use their Visa card to pay for an order with bitcoin is a big deal for those who already have embraced the digital currency both nationally and internationally. Among the top five countries (Turkey, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and South Africa), bitcoin adopters total more than 79 million people.

Companies such as Square and Cash App have been operating in the cryptocurrency space for years, meaning that credit card companies are relatively late in terms of accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, fintech apps that offer crypto are making money. Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018. Cash App reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.

London-based Revolut, which began offering cryptocurrency to users following a 2017 partnership with Bitstamp, raised $500 million in February, valuing the platform at $5.5 billion. Robinhood, the fintech app thought to be fueling the recent retail boom in equities day trading, first offered crypto in February 2018.

What are the incentives for businesses to accept bitcoin?

In the abstract, it’s good for a business to accept any payment method that banks and other vendors accept. When customers check out online, they often see icons for several payment options: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, PayPal, Amazon and others, depending on the vendor.

For bitcoin specifically, the incentive of a lower transaction fee can be lucrative. Of the major credit cards, “Mastercard generally charges between 1.55% and 2.6% per transaction, while American Express charges 2.5% to 3.5%. Visa and Discover are about on par with Mastercard, charging 1.43% to 2.4%, and 1.56% to 2.3%, respectively.”

Cryptocurrencies, at least in their current forms, seem to have the upper hand in terms of transaction fees.

“Cryptocurrency helps you to avoid all the annoying bank fees typically associated with monetary transactions. Get away from overdraft fees, transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and all other fees that go along with everyday bank business.

Cryptocurrency does charge a transaction fee in many cases, but it is rarely is above .5 and 1 percent of any given transaction. In many cases, having a cryptocurrency account is entirely free.”

Moreover, including a bitcoin payment system on your online store could become an even better investment over time.

“According to data from crypto analytics website BitInfoCharts, from May 20 until June 14, Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees decreased by 91% from $6.65 to $0.56.”

Transaction fees do fluctuate, meaning that if you’re out looking to buy a six-pack of soda and the bitcoin network is congested, you might want to use dollars instead of bitcoin. But at less-congested times, bitcoin’s transaction fee can make it a compelling option for saving a vendor money.

Again, when it’s what the customer wants to use, allowing the customer to use globally recognized currency to purchase goods and services is simply smart business.

How can your business accept bitcoin payments?

Here’s how your business can start accepting bitcoin as payment right now.

Choose your payment-processing provider and open a bitcoin account. Add your bank account information to avoid having your bitcoin transactions limited. Choose your currency. Enable bitcoin payments. Decide how/when to cash out, or keep your bitcoin as-is for future payments.

Which online shopping websites accept bitcoin?

Many more businesses outside the online retail space are accepting bitcoin. With major credit card companies and banks embracing bitcoin (here are Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase doing so -- the latter “has launched its own digital currency called the JPM Coin”), it’s clear that bitcoin is here to stay.

Bitcoin has been accepted by various merchants dating back at least six years, such as in health care by multiple organizations, by this cannabis vendor years ago and this beer vendor not so long ago.

If you’re thinking that this is evidence only of the counterculture embracing change while others wait for a fad to pass, Coca-Cola also has launched vending machines that accept bitcoin.

MIT had a vending machine that accepted bitcoin four years ago. Not to be outdone, Stanford University’s Department of Public Safety moved to bitcoin-only fine payments two years ago, though that appears to have changed since then.

Even in air travel, Norwegian Air is now taking bitcoin for its service. Perhaps you could fly Norwegian Air, booking with a bitcoin-friendly travel agency, to one of these cities with businesses that accept cryptocurrencies. To get to your destination, you could simply take an Uber, which allows users to spend bitcoins on rides.

For those wanting to use bitcoin without having to check a list of vendors, go to Amazon and use one of these methods. Many of the companies serving as conduits even find discounts on the products you buy.

More generous cryptocurrency adopters may choose to donate to these nonprofits and charities that also accept bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies can help members of the LGBTQ+ community “verify and protect their identities, especially in countries where they face repercussions.”

Starbucks, Nordstrom and Whole Foods will allow you to spend bitcoin online as well. You can even buy a Tesla or BMW with cryptocurrencies, and several dealerships or dealership locations will take your bitcoin.

This time it will occur by introducing a new law, another local publication confirmed.

Citing an anonymous government official, Moneycontrol reported that the government has been consulting with the law ministry, ministry of information and technology, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to draft a framework to ban cryptocurrency trading in India.

“There was a view in the government that banning it through a law would be more binding. It will clearly define the illegality of the trade. We have forwarded a note to related ministries for inter-ministerial discussions,” the official told the publication.

After the inter-ministry consultation, the bill will be sent for cabinet approval.

The High Court Ruled in Favor of Crypto

The Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on crypto trading earlier this year in a long court battle between the local cryptocurrency exchanges and the central bank. Though the use of cryptocurrencies was not illegal in the country, the monetary regulator restricted banks under its purview to offer banking services to crypto exchanges.

The regulator’s harsh action also forced many well-established local crypto exchanges to either shutter their services or move their base overseas.

Amid the landmark court judgment, the trading volume of the Indian crypto skyrocketed. Recently, many foreign crypto companies have been entering the Indian market.

Notably, there is no supportive voice from the Indian lawmakers towards Bitcoin or other digital currencies. However, many were hailed for their contribution to the blockchain technology.

Similar reports of the Indian government’s preparation for a law banning cryptocurrencies were also made in the past, but no official details are out yet.

Meanwhile, a panel formed by the Indian government to study the cryptocurrency market recommended a $3.3 million fine and up to 10 years imprisonment will be imposed on anyone dealing with digital currencies in the country.",2020-08-05 09:56:49+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/164962-russias-largest-bank-sberbank-is-considering-issuing-its-own-stablecoin-after-country-introduces-new-crypto-law/,"Russia’s largest banking institution, Sberbank, is reportedly looking into whether it should launch its own stablecoin, which are digital currencies that are pegged or backed by real-world assets, major fiat currencies, or commodities such as gold.

Sergey Popov, director of state-owned Sberbank’s transaction business, said that the institution is considering issuing its own stablecoin which might be pegged 1-to-1 to the Russian ruble.

If launched, the bank’s stablecoin would comply with Russia’s recently introduced cryptocurrency law, according to local news outlet Kommersant. The stablecoin, which is still under consideration, might be used for settlements that involve other digital or virtual financial assets.

Popov said that Sberbank could issue the state-backed stablecoin in accordance with the nation’s new cryptocurrency law, known as “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFA).

Popov remarked:

“We probably may issue a stablecoin on the basis of the law that has been adopted recently. As we can peg this stablecoin to the ruble, this token could become a basis or an instrument for settlements involving other digital financial assets.”

On July 31, 2020, Russian president, Vladimir Putin, signed the nation’s DFA bill into law. The bill prohibits the country’s residents from conducting transactions with Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported, the new law will become effective from January 1, 2021. The DFA was first proposed back in 2018. The new legislation will legalize crypto-to-crypto trading platforms, and will also permit purchasing and selling cryptos. People will also be able to use cryptos for loans.

The new legal framework for digital assets aims to differentiate between digital securities and digital currencies. The statute, Federal Law No. 259-FZ, is referred to as “On Digital Financial Assets, Digital Currency and Amendments into Certain Statutes of the Russian Federation.”

Crowdfund Insider received a note from the law firm of Buzko Legal, based in Moscow, explaining the new law. Roman Buzko, the Managing Partner of the firm, says the issuance, record-keeping, promotion, and exchange of digital financial assets (or DFAs) is regulated in a very detailed manner.

In brief, while digital currencies are not considered legal tender they are treated as property and will be regulated separately. The law states that cryptocurrency may not be utilized as payment for goods and services – even while issuance and trading will be allowed.

The regulation of digital financial assets are more akin to what you would expect with securities. “DFA” are not necessarily issued nor exchanged via distributed ledgers, explains Buzko.

Issuing platforms must adhere to a regulatory framework and comply with record-keeping requirements as well as AML/KYC rules.

In July 2020, Sberbank announced the launch of SberPay, which is a new system for payment services. According to Sberbank, SberPay allows users to pay for purchases both online and offline.

In May 2020, Sberbank called on suppliers to provide 4,917 ATMs that come with graphic cards to perform “blockchain operations.”",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-trudges-past-11-7k-as-defi-lending-rates-gyrate,"Bitcoin gained Wednesday while DeFi interest rate volatility is causing concern over its long-term viability.

Interest rates in Ethereum-powered decentralized finance, or DeFi, have see-sawed wildly over the past few months. Composite Lend Rate, a metric calculated by DeFi Pulse, determines how much profit an investor would return lending out crypto. It has fluctuated mostly due to the volatility of lender Compound’s rates, which have been as low as 0.122% on June 17 and as high as 18.6% on June 26. Compound dominates the DeFi lending market and had 3% rates for lenders as of Wednesday.

“A number of new applications are adjusting their protocol and token incentives, which can trigger extreme volatility,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for Tellurian Capital, which has been investing in crypto projects since 2014. “There is also a lot of shuffling of short-term liquidity among the DeFI protocols, which is not very conducive to longer-term sustainability and adoption,” he added.

A relatively unstable state – with a technically sophisticated population – creates a fertile ground for crypto adoption. Now, regulators are working with Ukraine’s crypto entrepreneurs to decide the future of digital currency.

Gleb Naumenko, a prominent Bitcoin developer from Ukraine who recently got a $100,000 grant from BitMEX, puts it this way: “Our political situation is somewhat unstable, and Ukrainians are tech-savvy, so this combination creates incentives for people fleeing from fiat to crypto.”

Since Soviet times, Ukraine has been a hotspot for science and engineering. When people see the national currency losing value, they are keen to explore the options technology can offer, Naumenko said.

Ukraine is the birthplace to teams that founded crypto startups Bitfury, Hacken and Propy, not to mention numerous crypto developers. While many of these developers are now based abroad, the country is still a competitive jurisdiction for crypto startups, believes Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine.

Prep work

In late April, the country started monitoring crypto transactions for suspicious activities. The government has also requested that Ukrainians report their crypto gains for tax purposes.

Ukraine is now in the midst of passing a law that will regulate crypto as a type of property and describe legitimate procedures for crypto businesses in the country. The law is still waiting for a hearing, which is yet to be scheduled, in parliament.

Ukraine has been the site of a simmering conflict since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and filled the eastern part of the country with weaponry and unidentified troops. Ukraine is striving to become a part of the West while relying heavily on the financial help from the U.S. and the European Union.

Crypto offers new economic opportunities. A regulated digital economy can bring tax revenue to the government, help banks serve crypto businesses and attract and retain startup talent.

The Financial Action Task Force’s 2019 directive for monitoring crypto transactions added some urgency to the need for crypto regulation. The intergovernmental watchdog asked countries to implement stringent know-your-customer rules for crypto exchanges and transactions. Countries that fall egregiously out of compliance with FATF’s recommendations risk being put on a blacklist, meaning they might lose some access to the global financial markets.

Later that year, Ukraine’s e-government agency published a Google Doc folder with recent drafts for a future crypto regulation bill. Everyone in the community was welcome to add comments.

An organized community

Some hardcore cypherpunks immediately wrote scathing remarks about the drafts. Big players including Binance, Bitfury and even Telegram sent back-channel feedback.

Earlier this year, before a U.S. judge banned the launch of the Telegram Open Network blockchain project, Telegram’s legal team looked at the draft of the crypto bill, provided some feedback and even considered registering an entity in Ukraine, Bornyakov said.

All through the process, government officials and small crypto startups have been talking and fighting in social networks.

If this doesn’t look like your ordinary lawmaking process, it’s not. Ukraine’s small crypto community may be better organized than its relatively unstable government. The authors of the crypto regulation bill also include Ukraine’s early crypto enthusiasts.

Take Mikhail Chobanyan, a member of the working group for Ukraine’s upcoming regulation for crypto. While not all crypto entrepreneurs are supportive of the government’s efforts, Chobanyan believes it’s better to take part than not.

Chobanyan founded the first crypto exchange in Ukraine and launched the first Bitcoin meetup in the center of Kyiv in 2014. A book kiosk in the park agreed to host the meetups and the first bitcoin ATM in Ukraine, he said.

Read more: Suspects Detained in Ukraine for Bomb Threats Demanding Bitcoin

The office of his exchange, Kuna, which started as an over-the-counter (OTC) service, was located across the park from the national tax agency. Chobanyan said he believes taxmen would walk into his office from time to time, ask about bitcoin and even buy some.

“They did not say they’re from the agency, but with my experience with the government I can tell a bureaucrat by looking at one,” he said.

If you can't beat 'em...

The government took note, too. In November 2014, the National Bank of Ukraine wrote a letter to Chobanyan saying his crypto enterprise was illegal and had to be closed. In April 2015, he was called in for an interview at the district attorney’s office and in November, law enforcement searched his apartment.

Chobanyan’s laptop, old cell phone collection, bank cards and even his pager were confiscated during the search, although not his crypto. “I was the first crypto guy who got searched in the post-Soviet space,” Chobanyan said, somewhat proudly. Two years later, he got his stuff back.

He wrote about the search in Facebook and immediately got direct messages from multiple entrepreneurs, journalists and even a presidential administration official. During a TV show shooting, he met Anton Herashchenko, now deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, who sympathized with his case.

Soon, Chobanyan became a volunteer adviser to the Ukrainian cyber police and got to know people at the National Bank of Ukraine. Since then, he said, he hasn’t been searched or interrogated.

“It was just the government’s way of getting to know people,” Chobanyan said. “We joke that a police search at your office is a sign of success. The way you manage such a situation is also an indicator: If you can defend yourself, you are a good partner to deal with. All the people I do business with had been searched at some point.”

When asked why he wants to help the government regulate crypto in his country, Chobanyan points at Russia as a bad example next door. The crypto community is not that proactive, so the regulations are written by politicians and bureaucrats not familiar with the industry, he said.

Ukraine’s crypto community took a different approach: “We came out and said, ‘You don’t understand a thing here but we do, you need to comply with the FATF requirements, so let’s write a law that would be good for us,’” Chobanyan said. “If you can’t defeat it, you should take the helm.”

Team work

Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine, has a long personal experience with crypto. He said he mined bitcoin back in 2012 but sold everything fairly quickly, then dove into the initial coin offering (ICO) craze, investing in some projects and even consulting one (he won’t say which). The performances of those early enterprises had a sobering effect, he said: “They all are doing not that great now.”

Bornyakov believes clear crypto regulation will attract crypto startups to Ukraine, but startups don’t necessarily agree.

Max Krupyshev, CEO of Cryptoprocessing.com and one of the first crypto enthusiasts in Ukraine, is sceptic. Krupyshev, who now lives in Berlin, said that as Ukraine is not a part of the European Union, a local license will not matter on the global scene.

Max Demyan, the head of the working group at the Ministry of Digital Transformation, agrees that given Ukraine’s business climate, new regulation will not be enough to attract new crypto businesses to the country. Ukraine ranked 64th out of 190 in the Doing Business ranking by the World Bank this year, and the country also is known for a high level of corruption.

“This regulation will mostly target the domestic market, but even this is a win,” Krupyshev admits, adding that now even domestic crypto startups are registered anywhere but Ukraine.

Bornyakov echoed this sentiment. “Our minister said that we needed to make all possible efforts to make the digital economy bring money [into the country’s budget]. Until now, crypto has been in the gray zone, so if we address that, a big leap can be made,” he said.

The new law can also help protect the property rights of crypto holders from harassment by law enforcement officials, said Andrii Dubetsky, strategic adviser to the Ministry of the digital transformation and one of the first crypto enthusiasts in Ukraine.

Distrust remains

Blockchain developer Andriy Khavryuchenko, Dubetsky’s former business partner, does not believe the new law will protect crypto holders’ rights. Instead, he thinks the law will be a magnet for corruption.

For example, a government officer might use the status of registered business to extort a bribe from a company willing to be regulated. “The registration is done only to have something to deny or revoke,” Khavryuchenko said.

As for individuals, declaring their crypto for taxation will only open them to new threats, Khavryuchenko said. “The data of crypto owners will immediately be leaked to criminals, including home addresses and family members information.”

Moreover, the government itself might be the thief to be afraid of, Khavryuchenko believes, voicing the concerns of those Ukrainians who don’t trust the government and fear it will abuse its powers – which is a stance shared by a major part of the population.

It could be risky, for example, to draw the authorities’ attention to the fact you own crypto, just like “showing you own gold after the issuance of the [government’s] decree on the confiscation of gold,” Khavryuchecnko said.

Looking for mass adoption

Demyan, who is also head of the blockchain startup GeoProtocol, notes that some members of the community will always be allergic to any interventions from the government. But regulation is inevitable, he said.

At the moment, there is no single crypto-related bank account in Ukraine, Demyan said. “Banks would love to [serve crypto businesses], they are always interested in new ways to make money. But for them, it’s important to understand how to perform financial monitoring in this case – it’s doable, but only after there is a law in place.”

Krupyshev said the first bitcoin enthusiasts in Ukraine, like himself, have been “dreaming of such a law back in 2014.”

Ukraine’s crypto market is indeed very active, he said, and with the new law, crypto businesses will stop hiding from the tax agency.

“Many old crypto folks will react, as usual, saying ‘leave us alone with your regulations,’ but let’s get real, we need the government’s support if we want mass adoption. People should not be afraid of this technology but be able to use it in safe conditions,” Krupyshev said.

The banks are also looking forward to the new money flow, Dubetsky said. “The opportunities for banks to make money are shrinking now because of the innovations in fintech and crypto.”

But as well as Bitcoin and precious metals are performing, it is Ethereum that has brought the largest return on investment since stimulus checks were issued.

Exactly how much would $1,200 invested in Ethereum have earned savvy investors, and how does this stack up to the rest of the market?

Ethereum Beats Bitcoin, Gold, and the S&P 500 In Stimulus Check Investment Returns

Since 2020 first began, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown by over $3 trillion and counting. A significant portion of that money has been distributed to individual US taxpayers in the amount of $1,200 per adult over 18.

The money is meant to stimulate economic activity, consumer spending, and provide relief to those hit hard by the pandemic.

Jobless rates have skyrocketed this year nearly as fast as the money supply. Stimulus money is being used for a variety of things, from everyday necessities like paying bills and groceries, to home improvement projects, to savings and investments.

The money flowing into the market has helped keep the stock market afloat. Meanwhile, hard assets with limited supplies are benefiting extraordinarily from inflation.

Gold recently set a new all-time high, and Bitcoin recently broke through $10,000. Silver, and its crypto counterpart altcoins, are also performing extremely well in this environment.

Out of all of the major assets seeing a boost from stimulus checks, it is Ethereum that has benefited the most.

How Much Did a $1,200 Investment Earn Since April? Top Financial And Crypto Asset ROI Compared

According to CoinMetrics data shared by crypto investors and NuggetsNewsAU CEO and founder Alex Saunders, the Fed’s stimulus is effectively monetizing crypto assets.

In a side-by-side comparison, the impact on the stock market and gold can be seen. But significantly above those two assets in terms of ROI, lies Bitcoin and Ethereum.

After initial checks went out in early April, those who put their money into Ethereum now have $3,000 to show for it. The same investment in Bitcoin is worth just over $2,000. An investment in the S&P 500 or gold, despite strong rallies, would have barely resulted in roughly around $250 profit.

Ethereum’s performance still pales in comparison next to some other crypto assets. For example, Chainlink which recently set a new all-time high has turned that $1,200 check into $3,600, tripling the investment.

The best performer out of the entire crypto market top ten, however, wasn’t even Chainlink – it was Cardano. Cardano’s powerful rally has resulted in a 335% ROI. This would have turned any $1,200 investment made on April 11 when checks started to go out, into over $5,000.

Is this a result of inflation, hard assets performing well, or are crypto assets simply breaking out into a new bull run? Whatever the case may be, the investment world will be quick to catch on when they see that stocks, gold, and the rest of the market can’t keep pace with the crypto space.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/goldman-names-new-head-of-digital-assets-in-bet-that-blockchain-is-the-future-of-financial-markets.html,"Goldman Sachs is renewing its push into Wall Street's digital future.

The firm made Mathew McDermott, a managing director who ran the investment bank's internal funding operations, its new global head of digital assets last month, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The appointment means the newest face of blockchain and cryptocurrency on Wall Street isn't a starry-eyed bitcoin evangelist or ostentatious start-up founder, but a 46-year-old veteran of old-school financing markets. McDermott replaces Justin Schmidt, an MIT-educated former crypto trader and quant who ran Goldman's digital assets team since 2018.

McDermott, who is based in London, does have a radical vision for markets, however: a future in which all of the world's financial assets reside on electronic ledgers, and activities that today require squadrons of bankers and lawyers like initial public offerings and debt issuances could be largely automated.

""In the next five to 10 years, you could see a financial system where all assets and liabilities are native to a blockchain, with all transactions natively happening on chain,"" McDermott said in an interview. ""So what you're doing today in the physical world, you just do digitally, creating huge efficiencies. And that can be debt issuances, securitization, loan origination; essentially you'll have a digital financial markets ecosystem, the options are pretty vast.""

Goldman's movements are closely watched in blockchain and crypto circles as proponents have seized on anything the bank does as evidence of the technology's broader adoption. The bank recently drew the ire of the Winklevoss twins, co-founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, for a report from its consumer and investment management division that declared that bitcoin isn't an asset class.

As hype and media coverage of the space has cooled down, there are signs of growing conviction among business leaders that distributed ledgers including blockchain will have a real impact, according to a global survey by Deloitte. Enterprise applications were a bright spot as funding for blockchain-related start-ups fell 28% last year from $4.3 billion in 2018, according to CB Insights.

At Goldman, McDermott is expanding his team, doubling its headcount with hires in Asia and Europe. He has also lured talent from a key competitor: JPMorgan Chase's head of digital assets strategy Oli Harris has joined the bank, according to people with knowledge of the move.

Harris was involved in JPM Coin, the first digital coin from a major bank unveiled last year that is intended to help disrupt the global payments industry. He was a vice president in charge of Quorum, the ethereum-based blockchain platform that underpins the JPM Coin.

In his first interview as head of digital assets, McDermott said he has near-term goals and more ambitious projects. A pragmatist and competitive triathlete, he is concerned that his projects are both achievable and of clear commercial value to Goldman and its counterparties.

First up is helping the essential plumbing of finance like repurchase agreements, known as the repo market, go digital, he said. Banks and hedge funds rely on the short-term funding for daily operations, and more than $1 trillion typically flows through the market every day.

""In securities finance and repo, if you look at those markets, they're ripe for standardization,"" he said. ""There's a lot of legacy processes in the vast movement of collateral that makes them very cost inefficient, so by leveraging distributed ledger technology, you can standardize processes to manage collateral across the system, and you have a much more efficient settlement process given the real time settlement.""

In his previous role, where he was global head of cross asset financing, McDermott helped fund Goldman's trading activities by tapping repo and other markets and issuing debt, expertise that set him up for his current job. He joined Goldman in 2005 from Morgan Stanley.

Further out, McDermott is looking at how ledger technology can be used in the massive credit and mortgage markets, and even the possibility that trading markets could eventually migrate to the format.

But crucial to any of these efforts is building consensus with other banks, institutional investors and regulators. The technology will only take off when it gains a critical mass of users across the world of finance, he says, adding that industry consortiums are the best way forward.

Given that approach, McDermott says he spends a lot of time talking to other companies, including JPMorgan and Facebook, the social network that recently updated its cryptocurrency strategy to appease regulators.

He even hinted that one Goldman project involves collaboration with JPMorgan, potentially regarding how the two banks' nascent technology efforts could work together. JPMorgan created the JPM Coin, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, to pay for transactions that migrate to the blockchain.

Goldman is also now examining the possibility of creating its own coin, McDermott said: ""We are exploring the commercial viability of creating our own fiat digital token, but it's early days as we continue to work through the potential use cases.""

If McDermott is eventually successful, the nature of an entire lucrative ecosystem of bankers, lawyers and back office personnel will be upended forever. He doesn't shy away from the implications.

""The honest answer is, of course, with any technological advancement, there will be a disruption to the existing status quo,"" he said. He cited businesses, like custody firms, that are actively embracing the future by investing in projects.

While McDermott wouldn't say whether he personally owned any cryptocurrency, he did have an observation that will probably raise cheers in the crypto world. Since the boom days of bitcoin a few years ago, interest has shifted from retail and rich investors to large institutions, he said.

""We've definitely seen an uptick in interest across some of our institutional clients who are exploring how they can participate in this space,"" he said. ""It definitely feels like there is a resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies.""",2020-08-06 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-entering-new-adoption-cycle-coin-metrics-says,"Disclosure

Yesterday, US bank JPMorgan said younger investors were “likely to choose Bitcoin” as an investment over gold while a report from last week stated Americans were investing their “excess” cash into cryptocurrencies.

Both developments suggest the same outcome: That cryptocurrency adoption and investment are rising in times of economic uncertainty.

Low-interest rates spur Bitcoin investment

Falling interest rates are tempting some Americans to forgo safety and pour their savings into assets such as stocks and Bitcoin, noted Bloomberg. The move comes as traditional stores-of-value — such as low-interest bank accounts — are losing relevance as “risky” assets provide massive returns.

The report said it’s now “standard advice” in personal-finance subreddits and Facebook groups to keep extra cash in high-yield savings accounts. However, rates on those have fallen steadily for the past year.

Ally and Marcus — the consumer arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — gave investors rates of only 1% and 1.05% in July (while DeFi projects like Yearn Finance boasted 1,000%) respectively. They have both fallen from last year’s 2% interest after the US Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time since 2008.

But means a very small gain for most investors, one that’s eaten up by the ill-effects of inflation. In contrast, assets like Bitcoin and gold gave returns of 55% and 29% this year, while Ethereum, Chainlink, and some DeFi tokens, gave a minimum of 300%.

Still, the report suggests the upside is yet not fully realized. While Americans are confident about the market, in the long run, 28% of surveyed respondents chose the stock market as their top choice for long-term investments.

Only 18% of respondents chose cash investments such as savings accounts or CDs, while a smaller number presumably chose cryptocurrencies.

Younger ones go for crypto

JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report Wednesday that younger investors are generally interested in alternative assets like Bitcoin.

Millennials are embracing stocks, particularly technology shares, whereas older individuals are selling equities, the report noted.

Older generations continue to use bonds as their favored instrument for excess liquidity, evidenced by their “strong buying” during both June and July.” The analyst referred to investment flows for their report.

Gold and Bitcoin ETFs have been experiencing strong inflows over the past five months, as both old and young see the case for an “alternative” currency, added Nikolaos.

However, that’s not to say older generations are not warming up to Bitcoin. Earlier this year, investing legend Paul Tudor Jones said his $22 billion Tudor Investments firm holds over 1% of total assets in Bitcoin futures.

And with the current economic climate of over-inflation and excessive money printing: Choosing crypto seems a lot natural.

The oldest and largest cryptocurrency rose to $11,755. The price is now approaching $12,000 for the second time in a week, a level that bitcoin hasn’t sustainably traded above for more than a year.

Bloomberg News went so far as to declare in an article Wednesday that “bitcoin mania appears to be almost back in full bloom.”

Bitcoin is seen by many digital-asset investors as a hedge against inflation, and the bets are growing that governments and central banks will have to pump trillions of dollars more into the financial system to stimulate the economy out of the worst recession since the 1930s.

Gold, historically seen as a reliable inflation hedge, surged this week to a new record above $2,000.

Yet, even gold’s 35% gain this year is no match for bitcoin’s 63% price increase. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is now up 3% on the year, with some traditional investors arguing that stocks have become detached from reality, merely propped up by the roughly $3 trillion of freshly created money that the Federal Reserve has pumped into the global financial system this year.

“Bitcoin and the crypto markets are once again able to claim independence from the traditional markets,” Mati Greenspan, co-founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Wednesday in a newsletter.

The U.S. government’s budget deficit this fiscal year is projected to soar to $3.7 trillion, far surpassing the previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, according to the Associated Press.

An extra $600-per-week federal benefit for laid-off workers lapsed last week, threatening the economic recovery, and U.S. lawmakers are wrangling over the details of a new spending measure that could range from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.

“Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a hedge against fiat currency debasement only grows stronger,” Anil Lulla, of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, noted Wednesday in an op-ed for CoinDesk.

The International Monetary Fund warned this week in a blog post that “another bout of global financial stress could trigger more capital flow reversals, currency pressures and further raise the risk of an external crisis for economies with preexisting vulnerabilities, such as large current account deficits.”

All that just plays to bitcoin’s strengths, as more investors start to extrapolate the likely stimulus needed to recover from a protracted economic downturn. According Bloomberg News, analysts for the U.S. bank JPMorgan wrote Tuesday that while older investors are buying gold, younger investors are buying bitcoin.

The analysis firm Coin Metrics noted that over the past week bitcoin had averaged over 1 million daily active addresses for the first time since January 2018. That was in the wake of the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high around $20,000 in 2017.

And Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research noted in a report this week that bitcoin daily trading volumes have been “growing strongly,” with several days topping $2 billion. The number of open bitcoin futures contracts on the CME exchange has jumped to a new record around $850 million.

“The strong momentum in the market continues,” Arcane wrote. “The sharp rise in open interest at CME is a clear indication of increased institutional demand for bitcoin.”

Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey on Wednesday that bitcoin could break past $12,000 by Friday.

The signs certainly appear to be pointing in that direction.

BTC: Price: $11,700 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,807 | 24-Hr Low: $11,380

Trend: Bitcoin is looking north after twin bullish cues were activated by a 5% rally Wednesday.

Firstly, with the UTC close at $11,755, bitcoin marked an upside break of a narrowing price range witnessed Monday and Tuesday.

In addition, Wednesday’s UTC close established a strong foothold above $11,400. The bulls had repeatedly failed to keep gains above that level on Monday and Tuesday.

The combination of range breakout and convincing move above a key hurdle has opened the doors for a re-test of recent highs above $12,100.

Still, the case for a rally to recent highs would only weaken if prices fall back below the former hurdle-turned-support of $11,400. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $11,700.",2020-08-06 11:25:16+00:00,,,,,,,,,

Bitcoin’s price was able to rally to as high as $11,917 Friday before losing momentum, falling back into the $11,500 range. “Over the past day, bitcoin tested the level of $11,900 but it did not succeed, and BTC slipped,” said Constantine Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital.

Bitcoin and gold continue to trade together. Gold is also down Friday, in the red 1.6% and at $2,030 as of press time. “The gold/BTC correlation is at an all-time high right now,” said Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. “The one-month correlations between BTC and gold have seen a significant spike over the past two weeks, currently sitting at about 67%,” he added.

One downward trending day is not altering optimism about the crypto market, added Koehler. “With bitcoin following gold as a store of value, and DeFi pushing ETH, the excitement is palpable in the trading community right now.”

John Willock, CEO of digital asset liquidity provider Tritum, agrees. “Sentiment in the market is highly buoyant and generally positive market news is increasing confidence and aggression in positioning,” he said. “I expect to see bitcoin bounce back quickly to $12,000 with ether to $400 this weekend.”

Smart contact platform Cardano intends to start producing proof-of-stake (PoS) mainnet blocks this weekend. Ethereum’s switch to PoS from its current proof-of-work setup is expected sometime by the end of the year.

Since the start of 2020, Cardano’s token, ada, has seen a market capitalization increase from $1 billion to $4.5 billion, according to CoinGecko. The platform, a competitor to Ethereum, has taken a methodical approach towards launching and now has 770 pools staking almost 20% of ada supply.

George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital, is looking forward to watching Cardano in the DeFi race, as smart contract capabilities for building decentralized applications on the platform are expected to launch later in 2020. “The transition to PoS mainnet is complete but stake pools do not start producing blocks until Aug. 8,” he said. “Very interested to see what happens with Cardano; that’s a big moment for the protocol.”

Last November, German authorities arrested one of the two main operators of Movie2K, while the second operator is still on the run, said the prosecutor's office.

Key Takeaways Pro-cryptocurrency SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been re-elected to serve five more years

Peirce's pro-cryptocurrency stance is well-known in the blockchain community, which has given her the title of ""crypto mom""

However, the SEC itself is fairly strict and harsh toward cryptocurrency, often rejecting new financial products

Share this article

Commissioner Hester Peirce has been re-elected to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), allowing her to serve with the regulatory body for another term. Peirce has a good reputation within the blockchain community for her pro-cryptocurrency stance, earning her the moniker of “crypto mom.”

Five More Years at the SEC

Peirce was re-nominated last month, then elected during a Senate vote on August 5, 2020. This decision will extend her term for approximately five years until June 5, 2025.

She was initially nominated to the SEC under the Obama administration in 2016 but was not confirmed until 2017 under the Trump administration. She finally assumed office in January 2018.

Beyond her current role, Hester Peirce has additionally served as counsel to SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins and served as a Staff Attorney in the SEC’s Division of Investment Management. She has also served the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

Hester Peirce Advocates Reform

Peirce has often taken a stance toward cryptocurrency that is more permissive than other members of the SEC, and she has continuously dissented against anti-cryptocurrency decisions.

She notably disagreed with the SEC’s decision to shut down Telegram’s blockchain project this year. Peirce noted that Telegram had built a working product, and said that the company had “made good faith efforts to comply with the federal securities laws.”

Likewise, Peirce criticized the SEC’s Bitcoin ETF rejection in February. She argued that the SEC strayed into “unbounded, dangerous territory of merit regulation” and argued that certain SEC rules have “one purpose: to keep bitcoin out of our markets.”

In late 2019, Peirce suggested that the SEC should seek “forward-thinking regulations” and proposed a safe harbor for utility tokens. She followed up on this by proposing a safe harbor framework this February, which is relatively lenient toward tokens that have commercial uses rather than investment applications.

However, Peirce is ultimately just one of several actors within the SEC. The SEC often shuts down and penalizes projects with good reason; Hester Peirce herself often does not comment on those decisions.

Data reveals that investors are losing confidence about the future of BCH and have decided to sell their holdings

If the selling pressure continues, BCH could be poised for a steep correction that would be hard to recover from

Share this article

The core development team behind Bitcoin Cash is once again butting heads over the features that will be included in the upcoming November protocol upgrade. Investors are selling their holdings as the risk of another chain split builds.

Bitcoin Cash: On the Brink of a Schism

Things are not looking good among the core developers behind Bitcoin Cash. Key developers are now feuding about the mining difficulty algorithm for the network. Discussions have been so heated up that even Bitcoin.com’s CEO Dennis Jarvisis affirmed that he is concerned about another Bitcoin Cash fork.

“I hope everyone can come back together to work on the future roadmap. There are no good outcomes from forking/splitting for anyone who believes in the long-term value and usefulness of Bitcoin Cash,” said Jarvis.

Those who work on the Bitcoin ABC implementation proposed a Difficulty Algorithm Adjustment (DAA), dubbed Grasberg, for the planned upgrade in November. The hardfork was set to tackle three main issues: the consistency of block production, miners’ profitability, and the rate at which new coins are minted. But, Jonathan Toomim, a proponent of the BCHN proposal, stated that this new code represented a “big step on the path to corruption,” and it “was not properly simulated.”

As the rivalry between both camps made headlines, it seems that they were able to compromise and find a solution. BCH advocate Hayden Otto announced that a new plan was created that resolves the issues between the ABC and BCHN developers, but failed to give further details.

While some remain optimistic that tensions will ease, it is uncertain whether or not the community will clash again in the future. The depth of the disagreement points to future clashes. As a consequence, a considerable number of investors have opted out of the project, selling their BCH.

Whales Dump Their BCH Bags

Santiment’s holder distribution chart registered a significant decline in the number of addresses with millions of dollars in Bitcoin Cash, colloquially known as “whales.”

Since August 1, the number of addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 BCH has been dropping steadily. Roughly ten whales have left the network, representing a 5.6% nosedive in over just a few weeks. When considering that these big investors hold between $3 million and $30 million in BCH, the spike in selling pressure can translate into staggering price drops.

It is worth mentioning that the sudden drop in the number of BCH whales can also be seen across the board. The overall number of addresses holding this cryptocurrency has been plummeting. Over the past three months, roughly 6% of all investors have entirely exited their positions.

There were 17.7 million addresses with a BCH balance in early May. Now, data from IntoTheBlock shows that 16.7 million addresses are holding this altcoin.

If the selling spree by whales and retail investors continues, Bitcoin Cash could be poised for a steep decline that would be difficult to recover from.

Can Price Support Save Bitcoin Cash Prices?

IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model suggests that Bitcoin Cash sits on top of a massive supply barrier despite the mounting selling pressure. Based on this on-chain metric, roughly 150,000 addresses had previously purchased over 161,000 BCH between $283 and $290.

In the event of a correction, this considerable support area may have the ability to hold prices from further decline. Holders within this range would likely try to remain profitable. They may even buy more tokens to avoid seeing their investments go into the red.

But if the sell-off continues, it may have the strength to push the peer-to-peer electronic cash token below this support wall. Under such circumstances, the IOMAP cohorts reveal that the next major critical hurdle lies between $256 and $266. Here, approximately 119,000 addresses are holding nearly 420,000 BCH.

On the flip side, Bitcoin Cash would have to break above the significant supply barrier that sits between $293 and $316 to aim for higher highs. Moving past this resistance level may have the ability to jeopardize the bearish outlook and allow the BTC fork to advance further.

Crypto Market Grows Overwhelmingly Bullish

While there are many reasons to be concerned about Bitcoin Cash’s future, market sentiment worsens this situation. Crypto investors seem to be growing exuberant about what the future holds for the overall market, which historically has proven to be a sign that cryptocurrency prices are overheating.

Based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI), market participants are “extremely greedy” due to the recent price action. This metric indicates that the market could be in a short-term bubble. In the past, each time the CFGI sensed intense greed among investors, a slump in crypto market capitalization soon followed. Bitcoin Cash may fare even worse given its shaky governance, hampering its ability to recover from a drop.

Therefore, traders must implement a robust risk management strategy especially now that the crypto market seems to be on the cusp of a major bull run. Right now, gradually taking profits and staying realistic about the crypto market is a must for traders.

The approval was granted under the CSA’s sandbox program, which allows firms to test innovative ideas without having to meet traditional regulatory requirements. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) was the principal regulator for Wealthsimple’s application in the CSA’s decision, which was published Friday.

“For the first time, Canadians will be able to use a crypto platform that’s carefully overseen by regulators.”

Pat Chaukos, director of the OSC’s office of economic growth and innovation, said Wealthsimple Crypto is now the first cryptocurrency asset platform to be registered with Canadian securities regulators.

“This is an important milestone for the OSC and the CSA Regulatory Sandbox, which worked together to tailor regulatory requirements for this crypto asset trading platform that will offer Bitcoin and Ether to Canadian investors,” Chaukos added.

The CSA’s decision notes that Wealthsimple can only operate the cryptocurrency platform on a beta-testing basis, which involves inviting individuals who sign up to join the platform’s waitlist to open accounts and begin using the platform. The regulatory relief will allow Wealthsimple to operate the platform for 24 months or until the firm becomes registered with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada.

“For the first time, Canadians will be able to use a crypto platform that’s carefully overseen by regulators, meaning Wealthsimple Crypto will be required to demonstrate that our product is appropriate for clients and that we operate a business that prioritizes investor protection,” Blair Wiley, general counsel and head of regulatory affairs at Wealthsimple, said in a statement sent to BetaKit.

RELATED: Wealthsimple to expand into crypto trading

Wealthsimple first revealed plans to expand into the cryptocurrency trading space last month, with the launch Wealthsimple Crypto under its newly-formed subsidiary, Wealthsimple Digital Assets. According to Wealthsimple, Digital Assets is authorized by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, better known as FINTRAC.

The platform announced by Wealthsimple in July would provide commission-free trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum through a mobile trading app. According to Wealthsimple Crypto’s website, the platform offers a quick sign-up process, no account minimums, no commission fees, and no fees to deposit or withdraw. At the time of the announcement, the startup had already launched Wealthsimple Crypto in private beta.

Under the stipulations set out by the CSA in its decision, Gemini Trust Company, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services will be the custodian of clients’ cryptocurrency assets. Wealthsimple will not hold any cryptocurrency assets in its own hot or cold wallets.

Wealthsimple’s expansion into digital assets comes amid a slew of controversies in the Canadian cryptocurrency space, with the most recent being Coinsquare admitting to engaging in market manipulation through the reporting of inflated trading volumes.

The lack of clarity on how to regulate the cryptocurrency market has presented an enduring challenge for FinTech startups in Canada. The CSA has previously suggested the implementation of a “regulatory regime” tailored toward cryptocurrency trading platforms.

“Regulation is one of the aspects of this product that reinforces Wealthsimple’s core mission to provide Canadians with low cost, high-quality financial products, in addition to fair, transparent pricing, and secure storage through our third-party custodian,” Wiley added.

According to a Chainalysis blockchain and digital asset market report:

“Overall, North America-based [cryptocurrency] addresses accounted for 14.8% of all cryptocurrency activity over the last 12 months. Like East Asia, North America has an extremely active professional market….[It] also hosts a growing class of institutional investors moving even larger transfers of cryptocurrency than those we typically see from professional traders.”

The report claims that the institutional share of the crypto-asset market has been growing steady during the last few years.

The report noted:

“As of June [2020,] approximately 90% of North America’s cryptocurrency transfer volume came from professional-sized transfers … those above $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency.”

During the past couple years in North America, Chainalysis claims it’s witnessing the impact of a growing class of institutional digital asset investors “whose transfers account for the growing dominance of professionals” in the region’s markets since December of last year.

Beginning around December 2019, the share of North America’s total value transacted made up of digital currency transfers of more than $1 million surged from 46% to 57% in May 2020. This corresponds with the rise in “the overall professional market share of North America activity rising from 87% in December 2019 to a high of 92% in May 2020,” the report noted.

The report confirmed:

“The increasing dominance of North America’s professional market since December 2019 appears to be almost entirely driven by transfers of $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency, many of which we believe are coming from institutional investors.”

Chainalysis revealed that North American investors “disproportionately” favor Bitcoin (BTC), as they would rather invest in the leading cryptocurrency and then maybe later consider allocating funds to other major crypto-assets like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), among many other options.

Bitcoin accounts for about 72% of all crypto transactions in North America, while altcoins (alternative coins) make up only 17% of all transfers, but this figure doesn’t account for transactions made with stablecoins, the report noted.

The report concluded that North American professional and institutional investors “tend to buy and hold cryptocurrency moreso than those based in East Asia, who tend to trade at a higher frequency.”

It also noted:

“The East Asia-based exchanges have a trade intensity close to double that of the North American ones, save for the period of November and December 2019 when the East Asia exchanges’ trade intensity shoots up to more than 3x that of the North America-based exchanges.”

Cryptocurrency markets are plagued with manipulation and “endless” wash trading, but industry executives are confident about H2 2020 performance, according to a new report.

Meanwhile, another recent report found that compliant cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges accounted for only 1% of the trading volume of the sector during Q2 2020 with $21.62 billion in reported volume.",2020-08-16 00:00:00

The major catalyst ushering in this new age was the bitcoin ""halving"" event earlier this year...

Halving refers to the payouts, or rewards, that bitcoin ""miners"" receive for securing the network.

By cutting the rewards in half, bitcoin's ""inflation rate"" – the flow of new bitcoin entering the market – drops as well. This means bitcoin, as a currency, gets stronger over time as its inflation drops.

Anticipation of the 2020 halving dominated crypto-related headlines for more than a year. When it finally came on May 11, bitcoin's inflation rate fell to about the same as the U.S. dollar's (1.8%).

Here's the key point... Previous bitcoin halvings have roughly marked the starting point for huge run-ups in bitcoin's price. After past halvings, bitcoin has soared as much as 8,000%.

We expect to see similar gains this time around...

One model, known as the Stock-to-Flow model (""S2F""), takes a look at bitcoin's scarcity by dividing its supply (its ""stock"") by its annual production or inflation (its ""flow""). Since bitcoin's future supply is known, we can use that calculation to project future price ranges.

By this model, bitcoin could hit $100,000 sometime in the next four years and $1 million per token within the next eight years...

Remember, of course, that these projections are far from guaranteed.

But my own calculations are similar. And on a stage in front of hundreds of investors at the annual Stansberry Research conference last October in Las Vegas, I predicted that bitcoin will go to $1 million in our lifetime.

Importantly, though, the recent halving is still only part of the story.

It's the big catalyst for the coming rally. But several tailwinds today are putting bitcoin and other cryptos on an unstoppable path to widespread adoption... And our financial system will never be the same.

Today, bitcoin is quickly going mainstream...

As the Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to print more and more money amid the ongoing pandemic, a lot of people are starting to understand the power and use for bitcoin and other cryptos as an alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Even the U.S. government seems to be paying more attention.

On July 22, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (""OCC""), which regulates the U.S. banking system, quietly released a letter explaining that it could take ""custody"" of cryptos on behalf of their customers...

In plain English, this means that, overnight, cryptos became as legitimate of an asset as the title on your home or car or a certificate of deposit.

This adoption isn't going to happen tomorrow. But it's coming soon. And that's why you need to buy bitcoin today...

But here's another critical point I want to make so everyone understands the importance of what I'm talking about.

While bitcoin introduced the world to the idea of computer-based currencies, it also spawned a new wave of technological innovation across many industries...

To understand why, you've got to understand not just bitcoin, but the technology that powers it...

Every crypto has a blockchain as its core technology. Think of the bitcoin blockchain as a giant Excel spreadsheet that shows the complete transaction history and location of every bitcoin.

Every 10 minutes, the spreadsheet gets updated as an additional ""block"" of new transactions is added. A blockchain is merely a chain of new blocks.

Everyone can have their own copies of the spreadsheet. It's completely transparent.

Let's say Jim sends 1 bitcoin to Sally. When the transaction is processed by the blockchain, the spreadsheet is updated. Jim's balance is docked a bitcoin, and Sally's is credited one.

But who updates the spreadsheet? And how do we stop people from trying to make false updates to the spreadsheet, awarding themselves more bitcoin, or trying to send the same bitcoin to two different people at the same time?

That's the job of bitcoin ""nodes"" and ""miners."" They're computers that run software to support the bitcoin network and keep it operating smoothly.

Miners are run by individuals or groups who contribute money toward buying powerful computer systems, known as mining rigs.

Why do people contribute time and powerful computers to the bitcoin network? Because they can get compensated in bitcoin.

But to get that honor, these computers must first solve a complex mathematical problem and compete with others who are trying to do the same thing. The first miner to solve it wins 6.25 bitcoin and gets to post the next block to the blockchain.

Bitcoin itself has been a proof of concept for blockchain technology...

Its success has shown the world it's possible for independent and fragmented entities (miners) to enable strangers to exchange value with no need for intermediaries.

And it can be done in a completely transparent, verifiable, and open way. Said another way, the bitcoin blockchain is single-handedly doing the job of more than 100 years of financial infrastructure.

It's the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the banking system, and auditors all in one package...

It's immune to government control (and government manipulation). And with a fixed supply of ultimately just 21 million bitcoins... it can't be inflated away.

No other currency in history can claim that... not even gold, which suffers a form of inflation as miners dig more of it from the ground.

That's why many people describe bitcoin as gold 2.0.

And that's why I anticipate that bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology will ""reset"" our financial system.

But cryptocurrency can change the world in other practical ways that many people haven't envisioned yet...

Take the ""reset"" of big banking, for example...

This is something our founder Porter Stansberry covered in his ""Capitalism in Crisis"" video, which went live last Thursday. (You can watch it right here for free if you haven't already.)

Banks like Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have entire teams and buildings dedicated to confirming and spot-checking the trades and transactions their firms make.

It costs them billions of dollars every year...

But one crypto could change all of that. It represents the reset of big banking.

What if an independent-payments platform could automatically execute when certain conditions came true?

That's the essence behind ""smart contracts.""

Ethereum, the world's second most-popular cryptocurrency, proved smart contracts are possible when it launched in 2015. It allows developers to write computer code for financial transactions. That's why some people call it programmable money.

Think of Ethereum as a global computer network that entrepreneurs and computer programmers can build the apps of the future on.

The network is so powerful because:

Money and payments are built into it.

Users can own their data, and apps don't spy or steal from them.

Everyone has access to an open financial system.

It's built on neutral, open-access infrastructure, controlled by no company or person.

Ethereum is at the very heart of the reset of big banking...

Just look at the decentralized finance (""DeFi"") movement. Thanks to Ethereum's automated smart contracts, developers have been able to use it to create all the services you can get at banks.

For example, you can now lend out your Ethereum and earn interest on it... You can borrow Ethereum... You can use it to get insurance on your crypto holdings... And you can build an automated crypto portfolio with it.

Ethereum is looking more and more like an international banking system. But it's more efficient, open to everyone, and offers products that are impossible in traditional banking systems. As entrepreneurs bring things like credit scoring to Ethereum, we could see the launch of mortgages, car loans, student loans, and more – all directly on the blockchain.

Essentially, Ethereum provides a way to codify, decentralize, secure, and trade just about anything instantly.

And investing properly here will yield huge returns.

For instance, my Crypto Capital subscribers locked in 100% gains (in dollars) on Ethereum in just three months. And we still think it could go up another 40 times from here as it morphs into a trillion-dollar asset.

My subscribers have booked eight triple-digit winners this year alone, the latest coming just this week. But it's definitely not too late to get in on this trend. We believe bigger gains are still to come.

The reset of both the dollar and big banking alone will influence every household in America. And it will spread across most of the world.

Good investing,

Goldman Sachs is considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Having recently appointed a new head of digital assets, the company indicated a possible collaboration with other companies, including JPMorgan and Facebook. JPMorgan has created the JPM coin and Facebook has proposed the Libra cryptocurrency project.

Goldman Sachs’ Cryptocurrency Plan

Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has recently appointed a new head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, a managing director who ran the investment bank’s internal funding operations. He has now revealed that Goldman is exploring creating its own cryptocurrency, CNBC reported on Thursday, quoting the new digital assets chief as saying:

We are exploring the commercial viability of creating our own fiat digital token.

However, McDermott added that “it’s early days as we continue to work through the potential use cases.” He is expanding his team at Goldman Sachs, reportedly hiring Oli Harris, JPMorgan Chase’s head of digital assets strategy. Harris was involved in JP Morgan’s cryptocurrency, the JPM coin, and was also a vice president in charge of Quorum, the ethereum-based blockchain platform that underpins the JPM coin. The coin, pegged to the U.S. dollar, enables the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional clients, JPMorgan explained on its website.

The new digital assets head said that it is crucial to build “consensus with other banks, institutional investors and regulators,” the publication noted. He believes that “The technology will only take off when it gains a critical mass of users across the world of finance” and “industry consortiums are the best way forward.”

McDermott further explained that he “spends a lot of time talking to other companies, including JPMorgan and Facebook.” The social media giant has proposed a cryptocurrency project called Libra, which recently updated its plans to better comply with regulatory requirements. According to CNBC, he indicated:

One Goldman project involves collaboration with JPMorgan, potentially regarding how the two banks’ nascent technology efforts could work together.

“In the next five to 10 years, you could see a financial system where all assets and liabilities are native to a blockchain, with all transactions natively happening on chain,” the new digital assets head opined.

He believes that “Since the boom days of bitcoin a few years ago, interest has shifted from retail and rich investors to large institutions,” the publication conveyed. “We’ve definitely seen an uptick in interest across some of our institutional clients who are exploring how they can participate in this space … It definitely feels like there is a resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies,” McDermott was quoted as saying.

Goldman Sachs has not been pro-cryptocurrency in the past. In May, the investment bank told its clients that “cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are not an asset class.”

The Block's Steven Zheng found that among the 49 darknet markets surveyed, about 98% of them support bitcoin.

Monero is the second-most popular cryptocurrency — it's used by 45% of markets — with litecoin and bitcoin cash drawing support from 29% and 12% of the survey markets, respectively. The results largely mirror those gleaned during a 2019 survey, though in that case, ETH was third-most popular at the time.

A report published earlier this year by Bitfury Crystal found that darknet entities are turning to transaction mixers — which help obscure the provenance of funds — in increasing numbers.

Read The Block Research's full report here.",,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/08/should-paypals-embrace-of-cryptocurrency-worry-squ.aspx,"Reports suggest that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is finally jumping into the cryptocurrency pool with both feet. That news broke shortly before Square (NYSE:SQ) reported massive revenue growth driven primarily by bitcoin. Proponents of cryptocurrency (crypto) believe this transaction medium will eventually supplant cash and card transactions. PayPal hopes adding crypto to its offerings will allow it to garner even more wallet share. Given PayPal's much larger user base and superior financials, this development should be a major worry for Square investors.

Why crypto?

Before we get into why crypto could be a big deal for PayPal, let's quickly define how it works. Crypto is a term representing any virtual currency that can be transferred directly from one owner to another through blockchain technology. The transaction is decentralized, transparent, secure, and reliable.

In the banking system, when you make a debit card purchase, your information moves from the retailer, to the merchant processor, to a payment network, then to the bank that settles the transaction. A crypto transaction would directly transfer your crypto to the person or business you are paying.

Crypto holders use different versions of software and hardware wallets and a growing number of exchanges to deposit, withdraw, and exchange crypto at any time, day or night.

Two quick comparisons make the crypto concept easier to understand:

Debit cards have largely supplanted cash transactions, allowing each payment to be recorded electronically. Stocks used to be bought and sold using a certificate. Individuals had to hold on to these certificates and sign them over to sell the shares. Today, most stocks are bought, sold, and held electronically.

Cryptocurrency is seen as the next evolution of money, allowing users to buy, sell, and pay each other directly without the need for multiple intermediaries. When it comes to the size of the market, a recent Forbes article reported the cryptocurrency market is estimated to be worth $270 billion. Fortune Business Insights projects the crypto market will grow by just over 11% annually between 2020 and 2027.

It seems that crypto is largely being bought and sold by individuals, as Binance Research found just 7% of crypto assets are held by institutional investors. Financial advisors seem to be picking up on the idea of crypto as a potential investment. A Bitwise survey suggested that only 6% of advisors were recommending crypto for their clients last year, yet this figure is expected to reach 13% during 2020.

PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo have significant name recognition among individual users. Given the size and growth potential of the crypto market, it makes sense for the company to begin offering cryptocurrencies.

Who are the competitors?

The initial information about what crypto PayPal will support is limited. However, looking at what some other companies offer gives us a good idea of what PayPal is up against.

Function Crypto.com SoFi Square Cash App Robinhood Buy and sell crypto? Yes Yes Yes Yes Deposit or withdrawal crypto from an external wallet? Yes No Yes No Crypto trading fees? Yes Yes Yes Yes* Members / users 3 million users 1+ million members 30+ million transacting customers 10 million users

It bears mentioning that PayPal's Venmo system ended 2019 with over 52 million users and the pandemic has driven significant user growth among its peers. In addition, PayPal's total active users last quarter approached 350 million. In order for PayPal to effectively compete against Square and others, it will need to offer the ability to buy and sell crypto, and it should allow deposits and withdrawals to and from external wallets. When the company releases more details, these are key factors for investors to look for.

What's in it for PayPal?

The simplest explanation for why PayPal would offer crypto is the company is looking to be a one-stop shop for personal finance needs. Venmo is so well-known that to ""Venmo"" someone has become synonymous with making a payment. In PayPal's Q2 2020 conference call, CEO Dan Schulman said in the U.S. alone, there were 150 million to 175 million people using a digital wallet from either PayPal or Venmo.

PayPal is also leaning into the trend of touchless payments during the pandemic. Cryptocurrencies fit perfectly, since a crypto payment requires neither card, cash, or physical contact. Square's Cash App reported that bitcoin revenue jumped 600% annually in its last quarterly results. PayPal likely believes its brand awareness, and larger user base, will allow the company to attract significant interest in its crypto offerings.

The one negative surrounding Square's bitcoin business is its razor-thin margins. Last quarter, Square generated a measly $17 million in gross profits on $875 million of bitcoin revenue. However, Square is seeing attachment gains from users who came to the Cash App because of bitcoin. Some of these users have expanded their relationship into more profitable options like direct deposit, the Cash Card, and more. The key difference between PayPal and Square is that PayPal seems to be able to afford bitcoin's thin margins.

PayPal generated over $2 billion in free cash flow in the last three months, whereas Square burned through more than $200 million in cash over the last six months. In addition, PayPal is sitting on $7.3 billion in net cash and investments, whereas Square has a little over $1 billion. In short, PayPal has more users, better free cash flow, and more net cash on the balance sheet. If PayPal puts its marketing muscle behind its upcoming crypto offering, it looks like Square investors should be worried.",2020-08-08 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-adoption-soars-slovenia-1000-locations-accept-cryptocurrencies/,"Crypto Adoption Soars in Slovenia: Over 1,000 Locations Accept Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrency adoption is growing rapidly in Slovenia. More than 1,000 locations in the country now accept cryptocurrency payments, including cafes, restaurants, dentists, hair salons, and hotels.

Cryptocurrency Adoption Soars in Slovenia

The number of locations accepting cryptocurrencies through the Gocrypto payment system has surpassed 1,000, Gocrypto announced last week. These locations include cafés, restaurants, taxis, mechanics, dentists, hair salons, hotels, and sports facilities. Among them are major retailers, such as the Tuš supermarkets, Slovenia’s biggest electronic seller Big Bang, Atlantis Water Park, and Burger King Slovenia.

Noting that “you can just use your crypto wallet when getting around your daily life,” Gocrypto remarked:

Slovenia [is] taking the global lead as the country with the highest number of physical locations accepting cryptocurrencies.

According to its website, Gocrypto is currently present in 15 countries and more than 150,000 products can be bought using its system. The countries are Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Japan, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the U.K., and Venezuela. In some countries, the system is operated by Gocrypto’s partner Xpay.

At the time of this writing, the Gocrypto website is showing 1,416 merchants using its system, only 95 of which are online stores.

The Gocrypto system consists of one or more point-of-sale (POS) terminals connected to the Gocrypto payment network. Customers can use bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, the euro token, and Gocrypto’s native token GOC to pay for goods and services. Merchants receive payments in their local currency. Currently, Gocrypto is compatible with the Elly wallet app and the Bitcoin.com Wallet.

The first version of Gocrypto, Elipay, was tested at BTC City Ljubljana, one of Europe’s biggest shopping centers, which has about 21 million visitors a year.

Merchants accepting cryptocurrencies can also be found on websites such as Acceptbitcoin.cash and Green Pages. In addition, map.Bitcoin.com currently shows about 500 merchants accepting bitcoin cash in Slovenia.

A total stranger had lost access to his bitcoin private keys—and wanted Stay's help getting his $300,000 back.

It wasn't a total surprise that The Guy, as Stay calls him, had found the former Google security engineer. Nineteen years ago, Stay published a paper detailing a technique for breaking into encrypted zip files. The Guy had bought around $10,000 worth of bitcoin in January 2016, well before the boom. He had encrypted the private keys in a zip file and had forgotten the password. He was hoping Stay could help him break in.

In a talk at the Defcon security conference this week, Stay details the epic attempt that ensued.

Zip is a popular file format used for ""lossless"" compression of large files, like the little drawstring sack that can somehow contain your sleeping bag. Many implementations of zip are known to be insecure, to the point that US senator Ron Wyden of Oregon called on the National Institute of Standards and Technology last summer to investigate the issue. ""If we find the password successfully, I will thank you,"" The Guy wrote with a smiley face. After an initial analysis, Stay estimated that he would need to charge $100,000 to break into the file. The Guy took the deal. After all, he'd still be turning quite the profit.

""It's the most fun I've had in ages. Every morning I was excited to get to work and wrestle with the problem,"" says Stay, who today is the chief technology officer of the blockchain software development firm Pyrofex. ""The zip cipher was designed decades ago by an amateur cryptographer—the fact that it has held up so well is remarkable."" But while some zip files can be cracked easily with off-the-shelf tools, The Guy wasn't so lucky.

That's partly why the work was priced so high. Newer generations of zip programs use the established and robust cryptographic standard AES, but outdated versions—like the one used in The Guy's case—use Zip 2.0 Legacy encryption that can often be cracked. The degree of difficulty depends on how it's implemented, though. ""It’s one thing to say something is broken, but actually breaking it is a whole different ball of wax,"" says Johns Hopkins University cryptographer Matthew Green.

Stay had only a few clues to go on to inform his approach. Since The Guy still had the laptop he had used to make and encrypt the zip file—also a decent indicator that the bitcoin was actually his to begin with—Stay at least knew which zip program had encrypted the file and what version it ran. He also had the time stamp of when the file was created, which the Info-ZIP software uses to inform its cryptography scheme. From a massive pool of passwords and encryption keys, Stay was able to narrow it down to something on the order of quintillions.

To run an attack of that scale would require renting cloud graphics-processing units. Stay tapped Pyrofex CEO Nash Foster to implement the cryptanalysis code and run it on Nvidia Tesla general-purpose GPUs. As they got deeper into the project, Stay was able to refine the attack and reduce how long it would need to run to produce results.

""Our initial expectation was we would do engineering for a couple of months, and then the attack would have to run for several months to succeed,"" Foster told WIRED. ""Mike ended up being able to do a more effective job with the cryptanalysis, so we spent more time developing the attack but then only needed to run it for about a week. That saved the guy a lot of money on infrastructure costs. Ten years ago there would have been no way to do this without building special-purpose hardware, and the cost probably would have exceeded the value of his bitcoin.""

The question still remained, though, whether all that GPU-crunching would actually work. After months of hammering on the problem, Stay was finally ready to try. The Guy hadn't given the entire zip file to Stay and Foster; he likely didn't trust that they wouldn't steal his cryptocurrency if they did manage to crack the keys. Instead, because of how encryption is implemented in zip files, he was able to just give Stay and Foster the encrypted ""headers,"" or informational notes about the file, without sharing its actual content. By February, four months after that first LinkedIn message, they queued it all up and started the attack.

It ran for 10 days—and failed. Stay later wrote that he was ""heartbroken.""

Advertisement

""We'd had lots of bugs before, but the tests I ran on my laptop all worked perfectly,"" he says now. ""If it was a bug, it had to be a subtle one, and I worried that it would take us a long time to find."" It didn't help that throughout February, bitcoin's price was dropping, and the value of the zip file's contents with it. The Guy was antsy.

Stay combed through his attack, worried about some obscure, incorrect assumption or a hidden bug. He soon struck on a new idea about which number, or ""seed,"" to try as the starting point for the random number generator used in the cryptographic scheme. The Guy combed the test data as well and noticed an error that occurred if the GPU didn't process the correct password on the first attempt. Stay and Foster fixed the bug. With both of these revisions to the attack in place, they were ready to try again.

""Poof! Out came a bunch of Bitcoin,"" Foster says. ""It was such a relief,"" Stay adds.

In the end, the infrastructure costs to run the attack were $6,000 to $7,000 instead of the roughly $100,000 they had originally estimated, Foster says. The Guy paid about a quarter of the original price tag.

""He got a smoking deal,"" Foster says. ""Projects like this are just completely unusual. If the details of his situation had been different, if he had used a slightly more recent version of zip, it would have been impossible. But in this particular case there was something we could do.""

Stay says that since publishing his technical account of the project in April, a number of people have reached out, asking him to help them recover the passwords to their Bitcoin wallets. Unfortunately, it's a common plight. Even WIRED itself feels that pain. But the zip attack has nothing to do with cryptocurrency wallets, which can occasionally have hackable flaws but are made with strong, modern encryption.

Still, the fact that zip is so ubiquitous means that Stay and Foster's research does have larger implications.

""It’s really cool from a crypto fiddling perspective,"" Johns Hopkins' Green says. ""It’s one of these ancient attacks on a crummy scheme, and nobody would have thought about it being relevant. But believe it or not, this bad stuff is still out there everywhere, so it’s actually really relevant. And the fact that there’s a pile of money at the end of it is really great.""

We should all be so lucky.

This story originally appeared on wired.com.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-kenyan-digital-tax-to-affect-crypto-platforms/,"New Kenyan Digital Tax to Affect Crypto Platforms

Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has announced new regulations that compel users of digital marketplaces to pay digital tax.

At a rate of 1.5% on gross transaction value, the new tax is expected to take effect on Jan. 1, 2021.

According to a report, the KRA will create a special tax unit to track and tax transactions using “data-driven detection.”

Still, the report notes that “at this stage, the precise meaning of a digital market place and those who will be impacted by the digital tax is unclear.”

Kenya’s Finance Act broadly defines digital marketplace “as a platform that enables the direct interaction between buyers and sellers of goods and services through electronic means.”

The report asserts that cryptocurrency platforms “fall under the digital marketplace designation since they offer a platform for buyers and sellers of crypto through electronic means.”

Like many countries on the African continent, Kenya does not yet regulate cryptocurrencies although the report notes the KRA has been pushing the central bank to recognize these assets for revenue collection purposes.

Commenting on the lack of clarity of the new regulations, David Gitonga, founder & Managing Editor at Bitcoinke, says the digital tax will nudge Kenya towards the regulation of cryptocurrencies.

“I think this bill is going to put a spotlight on many digital activities, including crypto trading, and this might open the door to some form of crypto regulation,” said Gitonga.

He goes on to explain that “crypto regulation has long been ignored because there is a general lack of understanding of how fast this space is growing in Kenya.”

Kenya is consistently ranked as one of the top five African countries with high volumes of P2P bitcoin trading.

As the Kenyan government has been looking for more ways to raise tax revenues, Gitonga believes “they will now give the crypto space a second look once they realise revenues that are being generated, especially on P2P platforms operating in Kenya.”

He adds this will probably kickstart “talk around regulation in order to capture this market.”

Will Kenya succeed in enforcing this tax regulation? Tell us your thoughts in the comments section below.

The New York State Department of Financial Services has created a Greenlist of pre-approved cryptocurrencies for custody service and listing. Meanwhile, crypto-friendly SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known as Crypto Mom, has been confirmed for another term at the commission.

NY Regulator’s Cryptocurrency Greenlist

The New York State Department of financial services (DFS), the Bitlicense regulator, has published a Greenlist comprising 10 cryptocurrencies for custody and eight cryptocurrencies for listing. “Any licensed entity may use coins on the Greenlist for their approved purpose(s),” the regulator explained.

The 10 cryptocurrencies are binance USD (BUSD), bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum classic (ETC), ethereum (ETH), gemini dollar (GUSD), litecoin (LTC), pax gold (PAXG), paxos standard (PAX), and ripple (XRP). The same cryptocurrencies are pre-approved for listing, except for ETC and XRP. “If a licensed entity decides to use a coin on the Greenlist, it must inform DFS prior to beginning its use,” the regulator noted.

The Greenlist follows guidance proposed by the DFS in December last year, which includes proposals for coin adoption or listing options that the regulator wanted to make available to crypto entities.

The DFS will maintain an updated list of all cryptocurrencies permitted for crypto companies’ business activities without its prior approval, “as long as such listed coins had not been subject to any material modification, division, or change after their listing on the DFS webpage (the ‘Greenlist’),” the regulator emphasized.

Crypto companies can create a “coin-listing or adoption policy” tailored to their specific business model and risk profile. If approved by the DFS, the company would be able to “self-certify the listing or adoption of new coins in addition to those on the Greenlist, without any further approval from DFS.” The guidance regarding the adoption or listing of cryptocurrencies can be found here.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate has confirmed Hester Peirce, the crypto-friendly commissioner often known as Crypto Mom, for another term at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Peirce has been pushing for the approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In February, she announced her “Token Safe Harbor Proposal,” which she described as “a proposal to fill the gap between regulation and decentralization.”

According to TokenInsight’s recent crypto derivatives industry report, trading volumes are seeing a 166% year-on-year increase compared to Q2 2019.

The derivative products driving these volumes are futures and options. While futures grow with traders betting on a bullish price sentiment, both open interest and volumes of options have reached all-time highs.

All-time highs

On Wednesday, open interest in Ether (ETH) options hit an all-time high of $351 million on Deribit and $37 million on OKEx. In fact, open interest in Ether options is 2.5 times higher than it was at the start of July.

A day prior to the major Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry event seen on July 3, Bitcoin options interest hit an all-time high of $1.7 million on Deribit and $268 million on CME, while daily volumes on Deribit doubled their all-time high, surpassing 47,500 contracts traded on July 28.

This all-time high seen the day before its expiration on the last Friday of the month could often mean the increasing acceptance of options and structured products, especially considering the record OI’s hit even on CME, which is the largest derivatives exchange in the world.

Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, spoke of OI being the best indicator to gauge the market, telling Cointelegraph: “Open interest is the best indicator to assess market adoption, and looking at the charts, it is apparent we are close to the end of July highs.” He added: “BTC options open interest is currently 116K contracts with a notional value of USD 1.5 billion.”

New horizons for investors

Options are financial instruments that allow investors to buy or sell an underlying asset depending on the type of contract they hold. Call options give holders the right to buy an asset at the strike price within a certain timeframe, while put options give holders the right to sell an asset in similar conditions. Denis Vinokourov, the head of research at BeQuant — a crypto exchange and institutional brokerage provider — told Cointelegraph:

“Options are a very efficient way to hedge exposure to the underlying product, be that Bitcoin or Ethereum spot or even futures/perpetuals. In addition to that, it is easier to structure products that would offer ‘yield,’ and it is this that has been particularly appealing to market participants, especially in the wake of sideways market price action.”

Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at OKEx crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that traders should be wary, as “high OIs alone do not indicate the market is bullish or bearish,” further adding that investors incline toward long strategies:

“We have recognized that there are a lot more professionals who are leveraging options for hedging their long-only BTC portfolio. And there are lots of more structured products available in the market tailored to professionals for the sake of yield enhancement or exotic payoff.”

With Bitcoin price briefly surpassing the $11,900 mark several times earlier this month, the general interest in cryptocurrencies has been on the rise. Bitcoin has rallied 27% since July 1, which is the highest spike seen in 2020. Bitcoin options are currently trading mainly on Deribit, CME, OKEx and LedgerX, while Bakkt, a crypto exchange owned by major traditional exchange Intercontinental Exchange, sees zero options volumes despite having the product listed.

Additionally, the put-call ratio has increased from 0.52 month over month to 0.76 on Aug. 6, which means that a greater proportion of put options were sold as compared to call options. This is a strong indicator of the bullish sentiment that investors currently hold. Lai added to this notion:

“Looking at the growing demand for Bitcoin options, OI and volume, it would seem to suggest that investors are still bullish on Bitcoin price, and with the greater macro factors such as the drop in the U.S. dollar price and an all-time high in gold, the demand for Bitcoin, in general, is rising.”

Ethereum 2.0 and DeFi drive demand

More investors seem to be acquiring ETH exposure using options in 2020. Ether, being the runner up to Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency space, has become one of the main experimental labs for blockchain scalability backed by large institutional and entrepreneurial development communities. Therefore, it’s natural for ETH to become a speculative asset as more decentralized applications are developed.

The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake shift for Ethereum and the rapid growth of the DeFi space have proved to be big variables driving the bullish sentiment while adding more credibility to the network. Seeing that Ether options are mainly traded by retail investors, at this point, as they are not traded in regulated exchanges like CME and Bakkt just yet, the growth is further testament of the community’s interest. Strijers elaborated more on the statistics of Ether options and futures traded on Deribit saying:

“The number of use cases for ETH keeps growing, and investors buy into this potential. Deribit ETH options open interest has grown 7x from USD 30–50 million six months ago to USD 350 million now which represents a 90% market share. And while ETH spot prices are peaking, the same applies to ETH futures open interest, which is almost reaching USD 1.5 billion, a new all-time high.”

Posting monthly gains of over 60% and YTD gains surpassing 200%, ETH broke the $400 price mark at the start of August. The impact of the release of Ethereum 2.0’s final PoS testnet “Medalla” and the implications it will have on the DeFi space are now being taken in by the market. Institutional interest has also appeared in the news — like Arca Labs launching an Ethereum-based fund registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Growing the pie?

While Deribit currently occupies the largest market share of the options space, there are new players who have been trying to capitalize on this surge in investor interest. While Strijers welcomed more competition in the space since it would help the pie to grow, there may be certain complexities involved, according to Lai:

“One of the prerequisites of a liquid options market is an equally or even more liquid futures market. Not to mention the complexity of handling the liquidation, mark price and margining, which is far more complicated than delta product-like futures.”

Vinokourov furthered this perspective by comparing the differences in running a crypto derivatives exchange to a spot exchange. He revealed that the main challenges surround maintaining a liquid order book “across a variety of expiries and strike prices, with a matching engine robust enough to withstand sudden bursts of volatility,” in addition to an institutional-grade system to manage risks. He further opined:

“If all that wasn’t enough, client acquisition is that much more difficult than spot equivalent because there are fewer firms that trade these products, and they require institutional-grade client management — something that crypto exchanges are not always able to offer.”

Irrespective of how the options pie is split, arguably, it’s only set to grow even further in size, especially through exchanges like CME now becoming a more prominent player in the space. The bullish sentiment of BTC and ETH will serve to support this growth further by allowing investors more opportunities to speculate.",

The rollercoaster of hash rates has left Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) prices soaring while provoking mixed feelings among crypto miners.

The COVID-19 pandemic has left its mark on the industry as well, forcing dozens of pools to either switch off or shift their focus from Bitcoin, with its increasing mining difficulty, to less complicated altcoins that are trailing the Big Daddy of crypto.

The impending launch of Ethereum 2.0 is giving food for thought for all miners in their strive to maintain profitability in light of the challenges facing the mining hardware market. After the Bitcoin halving and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, private miners were left reeling, but large manufacturers were also affected. Will the upcoming Ethereum upgrade aggravate the situation for mining device producers, or is it just another milestone that will be easy to adapt to?

Fewer, but still in business

The Bitcoin halving resulted in a serious cleansing in the mining market, with small miners losing all sense of remaining, but the near extinction of private farms was not followed by a significant reduction in major pools.

Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of the Poolin mining pool, stated that 15% to 30% of private miners producing Bitcoin’s hash rate are under immense pressure to remain afloat and are gradually shutting down. A decline of up to 20% in the hash rate is also expected in the short term, with an average daily drop of 6.5%. In total, the hash rate seesawed after the halving from highs of 135 exahashes per second to 98 EH/s, or a 27% decline. But that did not affect interest in the cryptocurrency, as institutions poured into the derivatives market, with Bitcoin options open interest increasing by 1,200% over two weeks.

The Chinese factor in the statistical field cannot be ignored — Chinese pools make up to 65% of all of Bitcoin’s hash rate. The pandemic has had its impact on the local mining industry, forcing more than 40 production facilities to stop deliveries. The delays have had a major effect on all miners, as older versions of mining rigs could not be replaced with newer equipment that could have increased the hash rate and compensated for the halved reward and increased difficulty requirements.

The drop in the price of Bitcoin in May from $10,500 to $8,100 saw the shutting down of almost 2.3 million Antminer S9 mining rigs, which is clearly reflected in the drop in hash rates from China, where most old mining equipment became unprofitable and was sold for scrap.

Not everything is bad

Although the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic at the start of 2020 affected supply chains and halted the operations of major mining equipment manufacturers, the disruption did not last long, as companies in China and South Korea — home to the largest manufacturers — quickly resumed deliveries. Bitmain launched deliveries from Malaysia of its chips produced in Taiwan and Korea, while Whatsminer rushed a new model onto the market to compensate for lost time and profits.

After resuming business in February, Hangzhou-based Canaan also announced the launch of AvalonMiner 1066 Pro, its latest chip model boasting a computing power of 55 terahashes per second.

Powerry, a cryptocurrency mining operator with 100 megawatts of capacity, announced the expansion of its capabilities by placing a $20 million order for new mining hardware. The equipment will be provided by Bitmain and MicroBt, while farm powering will be handed to Genesis Mining’s enterprise crypto-mining-farm software HEXA.

It is thus possible to conclude that even the expansion of the pandemic’s effects on the world will not have a significant impact on the manufacturers of mining software, which will be under pressure to deliver more new mining rigs to miners seeking to keep pace with industry requirements. The most that can be expected in the event of a second wave of the pandemic is delivery delays and increased equipment prices, which the producers would only benefit from.

The pandemic has not affected the operations of the largest Chinese mining farms, as any disruption would have undermined the Bitcoin network’s hash rate. But even the worst-case scenario of a China-wide shutdown is not likely to result in serious losses, as other miners will pick up the opportunity and keep the hash rate steady. A possible drop in the hash rate of major currencies due to the shutdown of Chinese farms would lead to digital money becoming approximately twice as easy to mine, and the profitability of mining would double.

What about Ether and altcoins?

On the one hand, the volatility of altcoins can play into the hands of miners. With the rise in the price of Bitcoin, other digital assets trail it even faster, thus significantly improving the economics of their production.

Experts believe that Bitcoin will remain the most suitable cryptocurrency for mining in the long term, despite the halving, because its price is more stable than that of altcoins, which can devalue sharply. Those still willing to stay in the mining game can opt for safer assets with high liquidity and capitalization, such as Litecoin (LTC) and Dash.

Rashit Makhat, co-founder of Powerry, stated:

“As a result of the Bitcoin block halving that took place on May 11, 2020, the block reward [...] was halved. In order to stay ahead on the market, miners must promptly update their equipment fleet. The most popular machines until 2020 – S9 ceased to be profitable for miners from almost any region, including regions with low energy costs, such as China.”

Migrating, are we?

The price of BTC seems to be of little consolation for many, as Valarhash — which operates some of China’s largest mining pools — decided to switch to altcoin mining.

Despite the recent 33% hike in Bitcoin’s hash rate, Valarhash dropped its contribution to the network from 4,000 to 200 petahashes per second in March. The company’s mining pools Bytepool and 1THash, which at one point accounted for 9% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, have had their processing power redirected to other coins.

The transition to altcoins may require a significant upgrade of mining farms. Investments in equipment for mining ETH and LTC have longer payback periods compared with BTC mining equipment. Mining ETH and LTC requires higher operating margins, and the equipment is more expensive. Scrypt-based altcoins like LTC cannot compete with Bitcoin in terms of profitability and return on investment. As such, the upcoming transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake is unlikely to usher in a revolution for the industry.

Miners and manufacturers still afloat

Despite the technical setbacks spawned by the halving, Bitcoin is likely to remain the cryptocurrency of choice for mining for years to come. The main reason is the relative stability of its price in comparison with altcoins, which are far too volatile to be reliable as profit-fixing assets.

In the long term, miners will become less dependent on events such as halvings. With the development of the coin’s infrastructure, the reward for processing transactions on the network will increase and, over time, may exceed the reward for finding blocks.

As for the manufacturers, they will keep churning out equipment and offering both attractive prices and upgrades to stay afloat and adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of various networks.

The difference of opinion exists on this issue. Bitcoin was the first coin launched in cryptocurrency without a specific purpose of corruption.

However, people involved in bribery and corruption viewed Bitcoin from entirely a different angle. They took advantage of Bitcoin’s anonymity feature to exploit corruption. They started using Bitcoin to evade the scrutiny of law enforcement and other government agencies. Cryptocurrency can unquestionably be used for illicit activities. Still, the overall impact of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on money laundering and other crimes is sparse in comparison to cash transactions.

Is cryptocurrency a corrupt currency?

The valid point in this context is whether illicit activities emerged after the advent of the cryptocurrency. Certainly not, as the criminals were involved in these activities far back in 2009 when Bitcoin was launched as the first crypto coin. Even in the current times, most transactions for illicit trades are done in the fiat currencies, or illegal traders exchange one type of goods in return of another. The term “money laundering” is primarily associated with the real money that involves the use of most common fiat currencies. Gold, the representative currency is used for smuggling activities.

People are misconstrued about the effective use of cryptocurrency. Governments are concerned about the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies. We discussed above that difference of opinion exists about cryptocurrency’s use. It is because of the following reasons:

Some people are not well familiar with cryptocurrency and its practical application;

A handful of criminals make use of cryptocurrency for illicit trade such as smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, and underworld activities.

Governments are not sure about bringing cryptocurrency into circulation as it is not transacted through a banking channel.

What’s the problem?

The problem exists because cryptocurrency is a virtual digital currency. No one can ever see and touch Bitcoin. They have not come into the mainstream of economies. But their use is emerging in the real world. It means that Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies do have the potential to provide the same benefits as the fiat money, or even more. Those who have realized this potential are viewing cryptocurrency from the positive angle.

How is cryptocurrency useful

In recent years, the use of virtual currency has become widespread in many different systems. A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that embodies valuable and intangible objects used electronically in various networks and applications. They include peer-to-peer networks, virtual worlds, online social networks, and online social games. Quick and secure Bitcoin transactions are at the heart of this leading digital currency, and more and more people are jumping in to use it every day. Besides Bitcoin (BTC), a few other crypto coins such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Tether (USDT) are on top of the cryptocurrency. It reflects the confidence of people in cryptocurrency.

Let’s understand the effective use of cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies let people buy goods and services, or trade them for profit.

Cryptography used in digital currencies is helpful to provide secure online transactions.

Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to exchange them for the benefit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.

Why trade in cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency trading is the most lucrative aspect of crypto traders. A crypto coin can be exchanged with fiat currency to generate wealth. Bitcoin trade has been highly prevalent since the time it made its entry into the digital world. Many people still don’t understand the worth of crypto trade. It would be useful for them to visit the bitcoin storm trading app site to know how it can help to generate quick real-time profits with the investment in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the first crypto coin for investment, but not the only one. A potential investor can choose other cryptos to derive their worth. When other trades are at risk, crypto trade booms.

The primary objective of this article is to view the positive aspect of cryptocurrency for money-making.",2020-08-08 23:56:42+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/researchers-claim-crypto-exchange-hacks-happen-in-three-ways,"Researchers at the Black Hat security conference revealed that crypto exchanges might be vulnerable to hackers. Although crypto exchanges have high privacy and security to protect their funds, researchers still found three ways hackers can attack these crypto exchanges, according to Wired on August 9.

The crypto exchange attacks were operating more like “an old-timey bank vault with six keys that all have to turn at the same time,” the report said. Cryptocurrency private keys were broken into smaller pieces. It means an attacker has to find them together before stealing funds.

Aumasson, a cryptographer, and Omer Shlomovits, cofounder of the mobile wallet ZenGo broke down the attacks into three categories: an insider attack, an attack exploiting the relationship between an exchange and a customer, and an extraction of portions of secret keys.

An Insider’s job, open-source library flaws and trusted parties verification

An insider or other financial institution exploiting a vulnerability in an open-source library produced by a cryptocurrency exchange is the first way where hackers can attack the exchange, says the report. It explained that:

“In the vulnerable library, the refresh mechanism allowed one of the key holders to initiate a refresh and then manipulate the process so some components of the key actually changed and others stayed the same. While you couldn't merge chunks of an old and new key, an attacker could essentially cause a denial of service, permanently locking the exchange out of its own funds.”

An attacker could also leverage another unnamed key management from an open-source library flaw in the key rotation process. The attacker can then manipulate the relationship between an exchange and its customers with false validation statements. Those with malicious motivations can slowly figure out the private keys from exchange users over multiple key refreshes. Then a rogue exchange can start the stealing process, according to the report.

The last way researchers said attacks could occur is when crypto exchange trusted parties derive their portions of the key. Each party reportedly generates a couple of random numbers for public verification. Researchers pointed out that Binance, for instance, didn't check these random values and had to fix the issue back in March. The report added that:

“A malicious party in the key generation could send specially constructed messages to everyone else that would essentially choose and assign all of these values, allowing the attacker to later use this unvalidated information to extract everyone's portion of the secret key.”

Shlomovits and Aumasson told the news that the goal of the research was to call attention to how easy it is to make mistakes while implementing multi-party distributed keys for cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, these mistakes can be even more vulnerable in open-source libraries.

As Cointelegraph reported before, CryptoCore launched a phishing campaign against several crypto exchanges and managed to steal $200 million in two years.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/74320/fintech-crypto-startups-offerings,"Square, SoFi, and soon PayPal.

The list of financial technology companies that have jumped on the crypto bandwagon continues to grow. And it makes sense — fintechs stand to cash in on such offerings, which can be more profitable than stock trading offerings, in some instances. It also provides fintechs with a way to expand their client base. Square's Cash App provides a great example of what a crypto offering can mean for a fintech company.

Earlier this week, Square's second-quarter earnings were prematurely released, showing that it made $875 million in bitcoin revenue via Cash App. Cash App generated $17 million in bitcoin gross profit for the same period. Square's filing also showed total expenses related to its bitcoin offering stood at $858 million.

Such breakneck growth explains why PayPal wants to get in on the action. The firm is reportedly working with crypto startup Paxos on the launch of a cryptocurrency service. It's not clear when exactly the service will launch or how many coins it will ultimately support.

In any case, the reported move raises a good question for other fintech firms not active in crypto: What are you waiting for? My colleague Ryan Todd dove into that question in a column last month.

Today, I'm interested in exploring the flip side of that question. That is, what is keeping crypto companies—specifically those with large retail client bases—from diving into broader financial services by launching stock trading, high yield savings accounts, and other fintech services.

Indeed, it is a question the chief executive office of LMAX Group David Mercer has given some thought. His firm, which has operated in traditional FX trading since 2010, launched a crypto exchange in May 2018. In an interview with The Block, Mercer said that traditional brokers in equities should be concerned about crypto players expanding outside of their home turf.

""I tell people in traditional finance, keep an eye on the crypto startups,"" Mercer said. ""They have provided market access to millions of clients and they could come after your business.""



He went on:

""Amazon, for instance, used to sell books. They thought people who buy books might also want to buy clothes, and so on. If I am sitting in a retail stockbroker, I'd be worried about crypto exchanges, because they already have my customer. They did the hard work of sales and marketing and client acquisition.""

Mercer makes a good point. Coinbase's client base, for instance, was recently revealed to top 35 million. UK-based Blockchain.com boasts more than 51 million wallet accounts. While it's not clear how many of these accounts are active, these are certainly audiences that go up against the likes of Robinhood, which claims to have 13 million users on its stock trading platform.

Indeed, a number of crypto firms have explored offering stock trading services, including Blockchain.com, according to a person familiar with the business. BlockFi, the crypto lender and trading platform, might also consider it, according to chief executive Zac Prince. Prince said he loves the idea, noting that it is just ""a question of timing/prioritization for us.""

To be sure, Prince is known for being somewhat overly ambitious. Still, he said the opportunity would offer ""more diversified revenue streams, more holistic product offering and stickiness with clients.""

Crypto firms, especially those in trading, could use some diversification—especially earlier this year. As my colleague Larry Cermak has noted in the past, crypto exchange revenues are 90% transactional. Thus, when trading volumes fall, revenues decline by just as much.

For much of the spring, stock trading dominated headlines, while large-cap cryptos like bitcoin and ether were trapped in the doldrums. Volumes and revenues were down across the board for crypto exchanges while brokers like Robinhood continued to add new clients and trading volumes in U.S. equities and options surged. As one crypto insider noted, ""these guys were missing out on the action.""

Indeed, insiders say it wouldn't be that big of technology lift for a firm like Coinbase to offer trading in the top 50 names, for instance. That's something Blockchain.com has considered, according to the aforementioned source. But there are a few hurdles that such firms face that make launching stock trading more difficult than it appears.

eToro, which operates a stock and crypto offering in Europe, brought its crypto trading platform to the U.S. in March 2019. The firm has yet to launch stocks in the U.S. as it is still working with regulators, including FINRA, on approval. The firm secured its FINRA membership at the end of June and is still working on clearance for its CopyTrader feature, says Guy Hirsch, a managing director for eToro in the U.S.

""It is much less risky to do the tech stuff,"" he said. ""It is pretty clear what needs to happen. On the compliance side, your intuition is correct, it is more complex.""

Securing FINRA membership is no easy feat. The crypto backlog of crypto companies seeking such approval has been well-documented.

For some crypto firms, the regulatory barriers make offering such products a non-starter, one executive in the space noted. It also might not make sense from a product roadmap perspective for many crypto firms, which still have yet to offer a full-scale product offering even for the crypto market, the person added.

""We could sell stock to people,"" the person said. ""But do we want to do that instead of rolling out a better options market for bitcoin, or DeFi products, or margin trading?""",,https://telanganatoday.com/bitcoin-crazy-rich-indians-falling-prey-to-fake-crypto-wallets,"These Blockchain-based wallets offer handsome discounts, before conning people of their hard-earned Bitcoin/cash and then going incommunicado, according to industry watchers.

By | Published: 3:10 pm 3:24 pm

New Delhi: With the Supreme Court striking down the curb on cryptocurrency trade in India in March this year, there has been a surge in Indians investing in Bitcoin and with this, cybercriminals have started mobile-based fake Blockchain-based crypto wallets to lure and con the rich and the wealthy in the country.

These Blockchain-based wallets offer handsome discounts, before conning people of their hard-earned Bitcoin/cash and then going incommunicado, according to industry watchers.

“I have seen so many wealthy Indian falling into the trap of such fake cryptocurrency wallets in the recent past. One gentleman just came to me who lost $50,000 (over Rs 37 lakh) while dealing with one such fake platform,” Manan Shah, Founder and CEO, Avalance Global Solutions, told IANS.

One Indian businessman lost a whopping Rs 28 crore in such crypto wallet scam, Shah informed.

A single Bitcoin currently costs $11,000 (over Rs 8 lakh) and Indians are now investing in crores aiming for higher returns.

The modus operandi of such fake wallets is simple. They target people via sending them messages on various social media groups, asking them to sell and buy Bitcoin via their apps.

The scamsters trick them to buy and sell Bitcoin via wallets and offer them trade opportunities with other app users across the world. Once they receive Bitcoin into their systems, they disappear and stop communication altogether.

Most of these transactions are happening via Swift Global Pay (SGP), Insta Global Pay (IGP) and International Global Pay wallets, informed Shah.

Go to the popular question-and-answer website Quora and you will know more about SGP.

“I do not see any genuinity in this wallet. I purchased virtual cards by paying Rs 3.70 kakh on SGP. It was delivered online on 15th July. Till now it is not accepted anywhere online. SGP site chat no response,” posted a user that goes with the name Kumar Chvks, Managing Director with an Indian firm.

“Email no response. So only the figures are shown on Dashboard. I tried to withdraw my money in the BTC PayPal and bank. None came till now. It is a clear cheating. Expected to be a scam of 7000 Cr to my estimation,” he further posted.

According to Sumit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO, CoinDCX which is India’s largest and safest cryptocurrency exchange, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to mature and increase in popularity, they expect more cryptocurrency scam apps to appear and other fraudulent activities emerging.

“Scammers and hackers are getting more sophisticated in their techniques. When installing apps, it is important to stick to some basic security principles, especially when virtual currencies are at stake,a Gupta told IANS.

The global cryptocurrency market was valued at $856.36 billion in 2018 and is projected to display robust growth represented by a CAGR of 11.9 per cent during 2019-2024.

According to Gupta, users should only trust cryptocurrency-related and other finance apps if they are linked from the official website of the service, and never enter sensitive information such as log-in credentials and account details into online forms unless they are fully certain of its security and legitimacy.

“Do your due diligence on the app on the number of downloads, ratings on the App Store, recommendations from legitimate publications, etc. before downloading. In addition, users should keep their devices updated, and use reputable mobile security solutions to identify, block, and remove threats from their devices,” he advised.

If something seems too good to be true, there is a high possibility that it is a scam and users should avoid it unless verified by a trusted party.

Bitcoin currency holds the major share in the market today, owing to the growing awareness among the Indian investors, coupled with availability of larger returns is proliferating the market growth.

Moreover, growing usage of alternative currencies such as Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash due to their captivating features and models has been major factors backing the growth in the industry.

A hint: It’s not you. And it’s a far cry from the decentralized utopia many claim it to be. Systems of power are rapidly asserting control over Bitcoin. And their incentives are not your incentives. As an industry, we’re at a critical juncture, and we have to choose. We either demand that the properties of user ownership and censorship resistance pioneered by Bitcoin persist. Or, we accept the facade of false-decentralization that has been erected by a centralized regime. Our revolution is being stolen, but it’s not too late to take it back.

First, let’s take a look at who controls the Bitcoin blockchain. Sixty-five percent of its hashrate is in one country: China. Globally, about 10 different organizations control 90% of the hashpower. The big pools are all linked together with dedicated networking connections. If I described to you a council of 10 companies dictating the future of a product, and more than half are in China and beholden to a centralized government, would you call that decentralized? No, but that’s the state of Bitcoin today.

Maybe you don’t care. Maybe you say, “even a 51% attack would be fine by me, because they are still economically aligned in the best interest of the protocol.” You’d be very wrong, but you wouldn’t be the first person to assume that a centralized power could represent your interests well. There are countless examples in history of misplaced trust in a centralized authority. Some of those authorities were beloved revolutionaries, leaders, countrymen and members of their community. Everyone thought, “They love their country, they won’t do anything to cause it harm.”

Robert Mugabe, the former dictator of Zimbabwe for 30 years, started his career as a beloved political revolutionary. He was instrumental in gaining independence from colonial rule. At the time, it would have been hard to think of someone who loved his country more. But that was at the beginning, before he amassed centralized authority. He ended his career causing mass starvation and social upheaval because of brutal, misinformed and, ultimately, failed social and monetary policies.

The problem is never just a single leader, it’s the system in which they are operating. Without checks against centralized power, what remains is to trust it will all be ok. And it never is. So, why would this time be any different? Because Bitcoin is somehow inherently different? Because the person, or people, who created it had revolutionary ideas? Come on.

Crypto was supposed to protect us from this, but instead, it’s given us new names with the same misaligned incentives.

The analog of social and monetary policies for cryptocurrency is the rules of the protocol. When discussion turns to updating (or not updating) these rules, control suddenly becomes very important. Important decisions, such as whether to scale the network as congestion gets increasingly worse, or to update the inflation schedule when block rewards will significantly diminish in 2024, will be left to a small council of miners.

In turn, they can use those opportunities to make decisions in their favor, to consolidate power, to siphon more value off the network, to gain favor of local governments, or any other number of things people in positions of power do to maintain their advantage. Perhaps their intentions are good. Maybe they don’t even want to be in that position? We have no way of knowing. And that’s the problem.

When you’re one of 10 players who meets regularly to determine the future of gold 2.0 – and you are de facto controlled by the Chinese government – maybe you won’t be the unbiased party you aspire to be. We have no option but to trust that everything will work out OK. So, after over a decade of Herculean efforts, billions of dollars invested and the hopes of an entire generation of developers and technologists, we’re essentially back in the same place we started at before cryptocurrency.

The other half of the puzzle is that even outside of centralizing consensus, you are rarely, if ever, as sovereign as you think. Institutions oversee every step. When you make a bitcoin transaction on Coinbase or Binance, you don’t make the actual transaction. Coinbase and Binance does. You don’t directly “use” crypto anymore than you own your own data on Facebook. You’re a customer of a new breed of big tech.

This isn’t Coinbase, Binance or any other exchanges’ fault. They have provided a level of access to millions of users that would be impossible otherwise. This is how it has to be right now, because crypto is so hard to actually use. Connecting to the network is completely inaccessible to anyone without access to server hardware and deep technical knowledge. Access to this revolutionary technology is locked behind some heavy and high gates.

Until we can remove these barriers, big tech exchanges are the only option. You may not be a customer of Goldman Sachs or Bank of America (yet), but you’re dealing with the same type of players with a different face, setting the rules to maximize profit from you for their shareholders, and collecting every mouse click and transaction. Crypto was supposed to protect us from this, but instead it’s given us new names with the same misaligned incentives.

Crypto wasn’t supposed to be like this. We wanted a permissionless system where users set the rules. We wanted a revolution. We got a new financial toy for a small handful of wealthy companies and individuals.",2020-08-09 11:00:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-artists-and-investors-trusts-nfts-to-transform-the-art-industry,"Nifty Gateway, a leading marketplace for nonfungible tokens with the backing of the Winklevoss brothers, recorded its largest-valued auction to-date on July 23 when the digital artwork and NFT “Picasso’s Bull” sold for $55,555.55.

The milestone comes as benefits of fractionalized ownership, decentralized provenance verification and the global liquidity pool enabled by blockchain technology are enticing both art creators and investors to explore NFTs.

I do enjoy a challenge but I'm feeling the pressure for my follow up artworks. @niftygateway pic.twitter.com/WFuCBfIS6r — Trevor Jones 🎨 (@trevorjonesart) July 25, 2020

Cointelegraph spoke to Trevor Jones, the creator of the record-priced NFT, and the artwork’s buyer, Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile of Museum of Crypto Art, to find out why they believe cryptographic tokens are the future of art.

Sam Haig (SH): How long have you been active in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space?

Trevor Jones (TJ): I don’t have a technical background per se but after a successful solo exhibition at the end of 2016, I had some money to invest, which led me to Bitcoin. I spent the latter half of 2017 researching and investing in cryptocurrency and then decided to work toward a crypto-themed painting exhibition for 2018, which was called “Crypto Disruption.”

Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile (PRF): We have been investors in the space for about four years now, having been early to Ethereum and major participants in the 2017 ICO season and beyond [...] Outside of investments related to NFTs, we have participated in early investments in Algorand, Hashgraph, Klaytn or Avalanche, to name just a few.

SH: When did you first encounter NFTs?

TJ: I was invited to show some of my work at CoinFestUK in Manchester in April 2019. It was my first crypto conference, so there was a lot for me to take in. I ended up chatting with David Moore, the CEO of the NFT art marketplace KnownOrigin. He was trying to explain the concept behind NFTs to me.

All I remember thinking at the time was that this wasn’t going to work, and especially with me being an artist creating physical work in paintings, there was no point in me exploring it. I was so wrong!

PRF: Like a fair amount of people, CryptoKitties was our “first encounter.” But we did not really begin to see the power of NFTs until we connected the dots on blockchain-based virtual land (Somnium Space, in particular) and crypto art. We used this as the building block to understand how important NFTs would become in representing both digital identities and brands for individuals and businesses alike.

Jones’ first NFT auction sparks a bidding war

SH: When did you begin exploring creating art in the form of NFTs?

TJ: It was five or six months after my conversation with David around September when I began noticing a lot more artists appearing on crypto-Twitter and talking about NFTs and the various marketplaces popping up. A lot of interest and excitement was developing around the digital art scene and when I saw a few artists selling their work for decent prices, I had to admit I was wrong (after my conversation with David) and that I needed to investigate this art phenomenon much more thoroughly and with an open mind.

I waited until December to mint my first NFT, which was a collaboration piece with the talented digital artist Money Alotta. Alotta had already been working in the NFT space for some time and so he helped me out a lot with the technical aspects of the process. There was a lot of excitement generated around our NFT drop “EthGirl” and after a serious bidding war, it was sold for 70 ETH ($10,080), smashing the ATH record on SuperRare by seven times.

Due to the fact that my NFT animations derive from my physical paintings, my work is exceptionally scarce. Since “EthGirl,” I’ve only created 12 NFTs (in nine months) and I believe this is one of the key reasons why I’ve hit the ATH sales record on all the major marketplaces — SuperRare, KnownOrigin, MakersPlace and now Nifty Gateway.

SH: What appealed to you about NFTs as an asset class to invest in?

PRF: Recording both land titles and art provenance on a blockchain always made sense to us. Some of the primary benefits of NFTs are low-cost transferability, ease of storage, display options between physical and virtual worlds, lack of incentive for theft (as opposed to Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can be mixed). NFT projects also offer automated secondary sale royalties and the ability for artists to represent themselves to global markets without gallerists as intermediaries.

SH: What was the first NFT you purchased?

PRF: Land acquired during the Decentraland auctions. Our first piece of crypto art, fittingly enough, was “LADY LUCK” by miss al simpson.

SH: Will you continue to invest in NFTs, and in what ways would you like to see the space evolve over time?

PRF: Of course, we will always be interested in acquiring historic pieces of crypto art for [MOCA]. Frankly we feel this is a beautiful and wonderful community, and there is not a lot we would change. As new money enters this space, we will be tested, and I hope everyone can remain true to what attracted them here in the first place. If we could make one critique, we would encourage all collectors who are just speculating with assets held in “vaults” to find ways to further prove the use case for NFTs!

NFTs are the future of art

SH: What are some of the benefits offered by NFTs that are most appealing to you as an artist?

TJ: Now that I’ve fully got my head around the rare digital art market and art concept, I see so many benefits, especially from the viewpoint of a physical artist/painting like me:

Creating digital animations with soundtracks is super exciting for me. NFT animations enable me to express my creative ideas and traditional artwork in completely new and dynamic ways that I’d never even thought of before and, importantly, to be able to monetize them.

Physical paintings and prints can be damaged over time if not properly cared for, whereas my digital work will always remain in the exact same visual state as when created.

Selling my physical painting via a JPG or “still image” NFT not only adds extra value to the painting but it ensures future collectors have access to my sales records. This transparency of my painting sales prices instills buyer confidence in my work and reputation — i.e., they know that I’ve not overinflated my prices, as they can easily see what other pieces have sold for and when.

Cost of international artwork delivery is very expensive (customs tax, insurance, professional packaging, etc.), whereas purchasing an NFT costs only a small gas fee.

It’s a lot easier for buyers/collectors and artists to benefit from the secondary art market. Auction houses are the main place to sell paintings on a secondary market. They take around 30%, and it’s a lot of hassle even getting an artwork in and up for sale. Moreover, artists are now getting a material percentage on secondary sales. So, for example, my “Picasso’s Bull” art drop on Nifty Gateway has allowed me to twice realize income from the sale, on the initial drop and also the secondary sale. An artist getting a piece of the secondary market sale is almost unheard of in the traditional art market.

Editions can be created easily — the digital version of the traditional print edition concept — so buyers/collectors who can’t afford a 1 of 1 can still collect an artist’s work in the form of an edition.

Fractionalizing (offering “shares” in an artwork) is now possible, and I’ll soon be offering fractional ownership of my physical paintings through NFTs.

Of course, being a painter for the better part of 20 years, I’ll always be partial to the experience of standing in front of a physical work of art. This feeling can’t be replicated in the metaverse… yet. Who knows what will happen, but I’m 100% confident that although digital art and experiencing it in virtual reality will become a huge part of the story of art, physical artworks will always be cherished and valued.

The interviews were edited and compressed for clarity.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-top-5-defining-trends-for-crypto-in-late-2020,"The cryptocurrency field is a place where everything changes in the blink of an eye. New technologies, key market players and trends shift much faster than in any other industry. From the current point of view, many exciting developments seem viable. Still, this chaotic industry can bring more opportunities within the upcoming months, and everything we’ve seen before will be surpassed by something truly outstanding. However, let’s quickly check in.

The shift toward a cashless society

One of the most society-redefining trends of 2020 came unexpectedly. Right after Christmas, the world seemed safe and sound despite dreadful news from China. Later in the winter though, it had been taken over by a deadly virus in the blink of an eye. The COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed, disrupted and stopped a lot of industries and made people rethink their attitude toward many things in life. Such previously questionable practices like remote jobs or crypto payments have become of significant importance and seem like they will remain present even after the pandemic ends. Why work from the office when everything can be efficiently managed from any spot in the world? Does it make sense to continue to overspend on luxurious offices if there is simply no need for that in the digital age?

Moreover, it’s about time to get rid of cash — we have to take a step toward a new quality of life. Meanwhile, the blockchain field has also blossomed, as a new era requires more professionals in the field of distributed ledger technology. In today’s world, apps for interaction with the crypto world have become advanced and straightforward enough to enable the purchase of digital assets with just a credit card. Stablecoin wallets are in high demand, and this evident trend is no more a millennial-only kind of thing as institutions join the club in substantial numbers.

Crypto is not for geeks anymore

The image of cryptocurrency is changing globally faster than ever. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are not a bubble anymore, as BTC’s market capitalization is now bigger than Coca-Cola and Intel, and blockchain is integrated into many fields and operations. Moreover, institutional crypto involvement is rising as the demand for Bitcoin soars amid the coronavirus crisis, with Grayscale experiencing a drastic increase in assets this year. More hedge funds are accumulating digital wealth fast — and that is sure to continue this year.

While the Facebook-led Libra project still has many stumbling blocks in the face of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators, its launch is continually delayed. Because mixing different monetary policies is questionable for the project’s success, we’re not sure that Libra will ever see the light of the day in the current condition.

One thing is undoubtedly evident: The world of mainstream users needs more convenient interfaces to interact with crypto — and they are coming. The digital divide steadily reduces, as in 2020, it’s easier to open a checking account in dollars or euros than ever before.

Growing DeFi adoption

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has become one of the most prominent trends in crypto since late 2019. The sector has been growing at a fast pace over the past six months, and a new milestone was recently reached by the sector as the total value locked in DeFi hit an astonishing new height of $4 billion.

Many companies that operate in the blockchain field have already introduced their DeFi products. Popular protocols such as Compound, Balancer, Curve and other platforms have opened the door to a whole new world of crypto opportunities for investors looking for deep liquidity, varying risk-reward ratios, and exciting, affordable modern financial instruments.

We’re about to see further adoption alongside user-base growth as institutional capital comes to the digital asset field. DeFi is growing insanely fast, and it’s of crucial importance to have a simple, effective, inexpensive on-ramp and off-ramp solution for this segment.

The advent of CBDCs

Nowadays, central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are either a hot topic to talk about or a solution in development in many countries. China, one of the world’s most extensive tech breeding grounds, has started to engage in creating the local digital asset. It would be exciting to see how a digital yuan launch and implementation could change the crypto world and shift the balance of economic power, taking out the dollar’s status as a global reserve currency. Could this example inspire other leading countries? The competition may be fierce in this field.

Stablecoins initiatives are still massively underappreciated throughout the world — most crypto holders are subject to volatility and counterparty risk. It’s not only global or local bank-lead projects that will be in the space in the future, as private companies are continuing developments as well. Projects such as USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX) and Stasis’ Eurs combine the benefits of blockchain with the reputation and relative stability of fiat.

Enhanced privacy with blockchain technology

Real progress happens when a crisis looms ahead. Back in the 90s, the internet was something of a miracle, magic or an arcane invention. Today, in the mobile-driven age of social media networks, we can hardly imagine our daily existence without the need to interact or communicate online. But with the growing engagement in digital life, we forget that all the available services, which are being used not only by casual users but also by most well-known CEOs and even presidents, are still too fragile, despite technological advances.

The latest Twitter hack compromised many high-level politicians, celebrities and individuals in technology. The problem leads to the question of what to do next. Discussions on blockchain-based improvements have heated up in a blink of an eye. We may see more problems, as hacking activity and ransom demands in crypto will not vanish anytime soon. Still, DLT will surely be noted when developing a shield for this particular dagger.

Looking into 2020 and beyond

Many analysts make distant forecasts for the crypto field and the price of Bitcoin, envisioning the further possible trends of the next decade. It’s undeniable that this once niche field is set to transform into a global mainstream ecosystem. Be sure to expect more price records, more inventions and more adoption.

What will the world be like in 10 years? Back in the 20th century, this question was much easier to address, but any predictions made today will highly likely become obsolete after a year. However, we can be sure that decentralized technologies and DLT-driven services will shape humanity’s further progress and development.

Source: Getty

The adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has significantly advanced since Bitcoin was created in 2009.

Nonetheless, there are persistent myths about cryptocurrencies and blockchain that hinder its adoption.

Below are some common myths, and the facts to debunk them.

Myth: Bitcoin and blockchain are the same things.

Fact: They’re different things. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Blockchain is the technology which Bitcoin is built upon.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, also known as a digital asset. It can be exchanged between two parties and used to buy goods and services.

Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a digital ledger known as a blockchain network. It contains Bitcoin’s entire transaction history and it’s publicly available to everyone. Its blockchain securely records transactional data by bundling it into ‘blocks’. New blocks are processed approximately every 10 minutes. This verifies transactions and adds another block to the ‘chain’.

Myth: There is only one blockchain.

Fact: There are many different blockchains.

Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and XRP, each run on their own blockchain. Each are separate from one another and do not directly interact. One cannot transact Bitcoin over the XRP blockchain as each asset is coded differently. This is like paying for a coffee in Australia with British Pounds – the cashier won’t accept the money!

Myth: All cryptocurrencies are the same and are only used for blockchains.

Fact: Cryptocurrencies and blockchains have a wide range of uses.

Industries like finance, medicine, energy, real estate and voting can take advantage of blockchain technology.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, amongst others, are digital money. They can be used to purchase goods and services such as food, flights or even video game systems.

The Australian Securities Exchanges (ASX) will transition from its existing CHESS system to a blockchain system in April 2022. The blockchain become the new prime infrastructure for clearing and settling ASX trades.

Story continues

Another example is medical focused blockchains, which store health data on a secure private network. This allows health professionals to easily access a patient’s records, no matter where they are.

Myth: Cryptocurrencies are speculative and backed by nothing, unlike money.

Fact: Cryptocurrencies are backed by the technology supporting them and its users.

Fiat money and Bitcoin are both not back by a store of value. Fiat money is government-issued currency that isn’t backed by a commodity such as gold. The word ‘fiat’ is Latin that roughly translates to ‘it shall be.’

Bitcoin’s value comes from the technology it’s built upon and the users who trade it. It also has built-in scarcity. Unlike fiat money, there is a hard limit on how many Bitcoins will exist; 21 million. This means, as demand for the asset increases over time, so too should its value. Hence, Bitcoin is considered a ‘deflationary’ asset.

Fiat money, like the Australian Dollar, is created by a government’s central bank. Its value comes from the currency’s issuing government and those who trade it. There is no limit as to how much money can exist. Central banks, like the Reserve Bank of Australia, can introduce new money into an economy. This action has the potential to increase inflation, which in turn decreases the buying power of money.

Historically, governments would have reserves of precious commodities, like gold or silver, backing their money. Printed paper money could be redeemable in that commodity. However, governments transitioned to fiat currencies – most notably the US government in 1971 when it cancelled the direct convertibility of US dollars into gold.

Myth: Digital currencies are primarily used for illicit activity.

Fact: 0.5 per cent of Bitcoin transactions in 2019 was transacted on the ‘dark web’ – far less than fiat money.

This equates to roughly US$829 million. Compare this with fiat money. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2009, criminal activities generated US$2.1 trillion. This is 3.6 per cent of global GDP that year or 2,533 times the amount processed through Bitcoin!

Digital asset exchanges like BTC Markets actively stamp out the misuse of cryptocurrency. Australian exchanges must register with AUSTRAC. They also comply with all anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies. Exchanges record known web destinations used for illegal purposes. Any assets sent to these addresses are stopped.

Myth: Cryptocurrencies are unregulated.

Fact: Cryptocurrencies are regulated.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are relatively new compared to existing financial systems. As a result, governments are playing catch-up to create legislation for this new era.

2020 has seen a lot of development in cryptocurrency regulation. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) plans cryptocurrency regulation as part of its 2020-2022 focus. The US Congress recently introduced over 30 cryptocurrency and blockchain bills.

Cryptocurrencies are legal and treated as property in Australia. This means they’re subject to capital gains tax. SMSFs are eligible to invest in cryptocurrency as permitted by their fund’s investment strategy. Digital asset exchanges are registered with AUSTRAC and fully compliant with all AML/KYC requirements.

Bloomberg, in their August 2020 Crypto Outlook, state “Something needs to go wrong to end mainstream Bitcoin adoption”. The future of cryptocurrency and blockchain is bright.

The first flash crash happened on August 2 with Bitcoin peaking at $12,123 and dropping to $10,518 in minutes. The initial cause of this dump was a large trader placing several big orders on Binance’s quarterly futures contract causing the price of Bitcoin to reach almost $100,000 before quickly dropping back. At the same time, this caused a massive bot-selling fest that drove the price of Bitcoin towards $10,000.

Ethereum is now facing a lot of resistance at $400, this level is now similar to the $250 resistance area that ETH used to face in June. We could easily see Ethereum trade sideways for the next few weeks before a clear breakout, however, considering the bullish momentum of the market, ETH is more likely to climb above $400 sooner than later.

Since the initial pullback on August 7, XRP has struggled heavily to go back above $0.30. Just hours ago, XRP bulls finally managed to push the digital asset above $0.30 just before another crash towards $0.285.

The campaign aims to elevate awareness of Grayscale’s brand and its products.



Grayscale provides opportunities for investors to gain exposure to digital currencies through its family of investment products that offer investors exposure to the digital currency asset class without the challenges of buying, storing, or safekeeping cryptocurrency directly.



The brand campaign features a new television commercial that depicts the history of money. Stills and video clips illustrate how money has evolved over thousands of years, taking a variety of forms including shells and metals. The voiceover reminds viewers that today, as we put value in fiat, government-issued currency, we’ve “proceeded to wave goodbye to value, printing unlimited amounts of money.” The spot begs the question: in today’s digital world, why isn’t currency digital as well? And Grayscale is the way to access the future of money.



The company licensed the Ramones’ number one hit, Blitzkrieg Bop, for the advertisement to further bolster the anthemic narrative.



The campaign is also supported by digital elements that highlight Grayscale’s brand proposition, as a trusted partner for investing in digital currencies and the asset manager behind the world's largest Bitcoin (Grayscale® Bitcoin Trust) and Ethereum (Grayscale® Ethereum Trust) investment products. Additional visual components of the campaign depict the breadth of investor-types that are now engaging in the digital currency asset class.



The new commercial will run on linear TV as well as digital and social platforms. The additional creative will run on digital and social channels. Grayscale collaborated with commercial director Brennan Stasiewicz, who developed and produced the advertisement working with Bunker as well as Vested in the creation and execution of the new campaign.

Last week, CNBC revealed that Mathew McDermott, a Goldman Managing Director, had been appointed as Global Gead of Digital Assets in July. The report quoted McDermott lauding digital assets:

“In the next five to 10 years, you could see a financial system where all assets and liabilities are native to a blockchain, with all transactions natively happening on-chain. So what you’re doing today in the physical world, you just do digitally, creating huge efficiencies. And that can be debt issuances, securitization, loan origination; essentially you’ll have a digital financial markets ecosystem, the options are pretty vast.”

Of note is the expectation that traditional assets will eventual become digital securities. Managed on blockchain and perhaps augmented by native smart abilities. While Goldman may be behind in recognizing the fact that inevitably all securities will be digital it is still very much a nascent sector of finance. You can expect McDermott to focus on both esoteric digital assets as well as traditional securities that are moving away from their paper-past.

Crowdfund Insider received several comments regarding Goldman’s renewed interest in digital assets from crypto-insiders. Dave Hodgson, Chief Investment Officer, NEM Group & Managing Director, NEM Ventures, stated:

“It is encouraging to see that traditional financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, who just a few months ago were pulling away from cryptocurrencies, are now recognizing the value of digital assets. I expect that this move will be reassuring to Goldman Sachs investors, who otherwise may find it difficult to gain exposure to this innovative asset class. It’s interesting to note that Matthew McDermott proposed the idea of a stablecoin – until further information is available, it’s difficult to assess why or if we need another stablecoin, what it is backed by and whether a large regulated financial institution is trusted globally to succeed. Imagine, for example, if Lehman Brothers backed a stablecoin…”

Hodgson said there are big strides being made in the crypto space pointing to the first EU state currency issued on the NEM Blockchain and interest in CBDCs.

“This is an encouraging step for the space as a whole, but altogether unsurprising given recent investments made by competitors JP Morgan and Fidelity,” said Hodgson.

Konstantin Richter, CEO and Founder of Blockdaemon, said there has been wider adoption of cryptocurrency to the mass market boosted in part by more regulatory clarity – specifically at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granting national banks in the US permission to operate crypto custody services.",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/74407/binance-ftx-poloniex-active-crypto-exchanges-defi-tokens,"Crypto exchanges Binance, FTX and Poloniex are most active when it comes to listing decentralized finance (DeFi) governance tokens, according to The Block Research.

Binance has already listed nine out of 13 DeFi tokens, including Maker and Compound. FTX follows next in Tier-1 category of exchanges with six listings, and Poloniex is at the top in Tier-2 category with 11 listings.

Coinbase, on the other hand, has listed four DeFi tokens thus far — Maker, Compound, Kyber, and 0x. Gemini and Bitstamp are yet to move — this reflects with their broader strategy of listing large coins that attract volume, according to The Block's Larry Cermak.

There are also many Tier-3 crypto exchanges that have listed nearly all DeFi tokens. However, these exchanges don't have reliable volume and tend to be illiquid, per Cermak.

DeFi tokens have been seen to jump in price after their listing on Binance or Coinbase. For instance, Binance recently listed Balancer's BAL token and Yearn. Finance's YFI token and both have increased by at least 50% since their listing.

The purchase of Bitcoin cryptocurrency was made pursuant to the two-pronged capital allocation strategy previously announced by the company when it released its second quarter 2020 financial results on July 28, 2020.

The company addressed the first prong, which called for returning a portion of its excess cash to shareholders, when it announced today that it had launched a cash tender offer for up to $250 million of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock via a modified Dutch Auction offer. By acquiring 21,454 bitcoins, MicroStrategy addressed the other prong of its capital allocation strategy, which called for investing up to $250 million in one or more alternative investments or assets.

“ Our investment in Bitcoin is part of our new capital allocation strategy, which seeks to maximize long-term value for our shareholders,” said Michael J. Saylor, CEO, MicroStrategy Incorporated. “ This investment reflects our belief that Bitcoin, as the world’s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions. MicroStrategy has recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.”

Mr. Saylor continued, “ MicroStrategy spent months deliberating to determine our capital allocation strategy. Our decision to invest in Bitcoin at this time was driven in part by a confluence of macro factors affecting the economic and business landscape that we believe is creating long-term risks for our corporate treasury program ― risks that should be addressed proactively. Those macro factors include, among other things, the economic and public health crisis precipitated by COVID-19, unprecedented government financial stimulus measures including quantitative easing adopted around the world, and global political and economic uncertainty. We believe that, together, these and other factors may well have a significant depreciating effect on the long-term real value of fiat currencies and many other conventional asset types, including many of the assets traditionally held as part of corporate treasury operations.”

In considering various asset classes for potential investment, MicroStrategy observed distinctive properties of Bitcoin that led it to believe investing in the cryptocurrency would provide not only a reasonable hedge against inflation, but also the prospect of earning a higher return than other investments. Mr. Saylor articulated the opinion, “ We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value. Bitcoin is digital gold – harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it. We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.”

A leader in the business intelligence space, MicroStrategy has a 30-year history of anticipating technology trends. MicroStrategy was one of the first companies in the enterprise business intelligence software sector. It was a pioneer in Relational Analytics, Web Intelligence, and Mobile Intelligence and has most recently invented HyperIntelligence® – zero click insights that can be embedded in applications to make them smarter, faster, and stronger.

In 2012, Mr. Saylor wrote “The Mobile Wave,” addressing the impact mobile computing would have on business, consumer, and political behavior and the implications of the rise of Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. MicroStrategy believes the world is entering “The Virtual Wave” – a rapid dematerialization of products, services, and processes enabled by advances in technology and catalyzed by the COVID crisis. MicroStrategy believes digital transformation has quickened amid rapidly shifting market requirements. These dynamics have many corporations rethinking their offerings, operations, and systems, as well as their balance sheets and financial strategies.

“ MicroStrategy remains focused on its corporate strategy of operating a growing profitable business intelligence company, serving some of the largest most respected institutions worldwide. This strategy includes seeking to grow its revenue through its HyperIntelligence, Cloud Intelligence, and Embedded Intelligence offerings, a refreshed go-to-market focused on simplified products and pricing, and a cloud-first platform-as-a-service focus. MicroStrategy’s goal of generating long-term operating income and free cash flow has also led it to adopt a new capital allocation strategy. MicroStrategy believes that buying $250 million in Bitcoin will provide it the opportunity to earn better returns and preserve the value of our capital over time compared to holding cash. Our corporate strategy and two-pronged capital allocation strategy are designed to benefit shareholders, customers, partners, and employees,” said Phong Le, President & CFO, MicroStrategy Incorporated.

MSTR-F",,https://www.coindesk.com/how-much-ether-is-out-there-ethereum-developers-create-new-scripts-for-self-verification,"Ethereum and Bitcoin advocates have engaged in spirited Twitter exchange since Friday to answer an ostensibly simple question: What’s the total supply of ether?

It’s not quite clear where the question originated. But providing one agreed-upon value for Ethereum’s native currency, ether (ETH), proved contentious enough to warrant new code.

“Adding a proper total supply command to the client seems like a low-cost and reasonable thing to do,” said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in the Ethereum R&D Discord channel last Friday.

Multiple independent developers jumped on the opportunity to set the “world computer’s” supply schedule straight.

The coin supply brouhaha takes place in the context of Bitcoin’s more-easily verifiable coin supply, thanks to the gettxoutsetinfo command, which every Bitcoin node can execute to calculate the current supply. Due to its distinct design features, Ethereum lacked such a command, hence the impetus behind independent developers writing code to calculate its supply.

The total supply of ether is 111,562,994 as of publishing time, according to Messari. (The firm pulls data directly off the blockchain, Messari director of research Eric Turner told CoinDesk.)

Ether, bitcoin and verifiability

The verifiability of assets is both a strong and novel feature of blockchains. Only rough supply counts exist for other assets such as gold or dollars. The supply of a given cryptocurrency, on the other hand, can be parsed down to the exact unit. This is valuable for modeling or auditing, among other reasons.

Bitcoin proponents – notably Kraken developer Pierre Rochard – recently pointed out that Ethereum had no simple method for verifying the supply of its native unit.

Bitcoin’s value and perception as “digital gold” emphasizes its supply characteristics – namely scarcity – moreso than Ethereum, which aims to serve as a developer platform for decentralized financial applications.

Indeed, many Ethereum community members were dismissive of the supply question. “I don’t give a shit about the supply,” said Augur co-founder and early cryptocurrency investor Jeremy Gardner on Twitter.

Beyond simply running the numbers, however, an additional concern voiced after the fact was the difficulty of running a full Ethereum node. Users who run their own nodes can “self-verify” not only the number of ethers in existence but also the validity of transactions on the Ethereum network.

Self-verification is a popular social concept, as well as an ethical touchstone, for Bitcoin proponents. The argument mainly relies on the ease of bootstrapping a Bitcoin node. Running an Ethereum node, on the other hand, is a much more time- and memory-intensive undertaking, one that’s led to the emergence of a small class of infrastructure service providers.

Ethereum community members are more dismissive of running a full node based on arguments from Buterin in the project’s early days. Ethereum 2.0 developers are also shooting for self-verification via lightweight clients made possible through Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

Third-party scripts

As attention paid to the supply discussion on Twitter grew, Ethereum developers started building scripts to calculate the supply.

Developers were quick to note that many data sites posted wrong figures because of faulty modeling of coin issuance.

In Ethereum, many third party-scripts fail to calculate a few complexities such as uncle or nephew blocks and burner addresses, cryptocurrency educator Andreas Antonopoulos said in a tweet.

Bitcoin developers have often made similar mistakes, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp tweeted. Lopp said many scripts fail to take into account block rewards, called the coinbase, left unclaimed by miners.

Regardless, Ethereum does have one actual supply figure even if it has been difficult to locate, Geth team leader Péter Szilágyi said in a tweet. If it did not, Ethereum wouldn’t work.",2020-08-11 19:55:45+00:00,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/investing/bitcoin-prices/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin is on a tear: The price of one bitcoin is now trading just above $11,500, the highest level in about a year. Bitcoin has surged more than 60% in 2020 and is up more than 180% from its mid-March lows of about $4,000.

What's driving the bitcoin spike? Experts say much of it is due to the weakness in the US dollar. The dollar has plunged in recent months on expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero for years as a result of the financial disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic.

""It's a flight to safety,"" said James Putra, head of product strategy for TradeStation Crypto.

Of course, safety is a relative term these days. Investors may think that bitcoin is a good hedge against a falling dollar. But the virtual currency remains exceedingly volatile.

According to Coin Dance’s Paxful and LocalBitcoins volume data, India’s bitcoin peer-to-peer trade volume reached an all-time high in July.

Siddhartha Dutta, CEO of Marlin, a tech startup in Bangalore, said the recent spike in demand for bitcoin mirrors Indians’ reaction to demonetization in 2016. Back then some people learned the value of holding bitcoin, whose issuance is not controlled by any government, when the Indian government recalled a vast percentage of paper currency.

The old bills suddenly lost value due to a government decree. The idea that bitcoin’s value is based on market principles, instead of fickle government policies, made it particularly attractive.

The price of bitcoin on Zebpay, an Indian crypto exchange, had surged from $757 to $1,020 in 18 days after demonetization, while the bitcoin price in the U.S. remained relatively static. For some Indian investors, investing in bitcoin was a safe option to store their wealth and minimize the uncertainties caused by demonetization and a possible gold ban.

India’s growing crypto market dramatically slowed in 2018, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered financial institutions to avoid working with crypto exchanges.

Now, the lifting of banking restrictions appears to have unleashed pent-up demand for cryptocurrency, which no government can declare worthless. These days bitcoin activity is ramping up across India on peer-to-peer exchanges such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins.

As the chart below shows, India’s peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction volumes have doubled over the last five months.

According to a spokeswoman for Paxful, one of the leading peer-to-peer trading platforms, India is now among the five fastest-growing bitcoin user groups in the world. Paxful’s Indian volumes surged from around $576,000 in May 2019 to $8.97 million in July 2020, and the total peer-to-peer Indian volumes on Paxful and LocalBitcoins reached $13.7 million. Smaller exchanges serving the Indian market, like Delta Exchange, are also seeing rapid growth (though Delta is a derivatives exchange, not a spot market). Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said new signups are growing 100% month-over-month.

Dutta believes crypto has also been slowly gaining traction thanks to mesh networks that help provide connectivity and fast streaming in rural areas. This could signal the start of an even bigger adoption cycle.

“People in India are getting exposed to the internet, mobile first,” Dutta said. However, he added, this growth should not be mistaken for “mainstream” adoption.

Crypto startups

The bull market, combined with coronavirus travel restrictions, could energize India’s startup scene.

Bangalore-based entrepreneur Prashanth Balasubramanian is the co-founder of the Lightning wallet startup Lastbit. Lastbit aims to reach beyond the Indian market to serve Europe and eventually North America. But since 2020 will be a year of relative quarantine, Balasubramanian is thinking it’s a good time to build at home.

“Silicon Valley is a fantastic place for business, but as a young company we’re able to function more effectively and keep things lean with a 10x difference in runway by using our Indian roots,” he said.

Dutta said he expects that cryptocurrency projects will continue to proliferate across India’s tech industry during the coronavirus recession.

“There is certainly potential to grow much more,” Dutta said.

Popular American-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has rumored plans to pursue a public debut later this year, or early next year—making the company the latest mega-startup to approach the public markets. The company has not yet officially announced its plans to go public, but has reportedly been in talks with investment banks and has spoken with law firms, which would mark a significant milestone for the crypto market.

Founded in 2012, Coinbase is one of—if not the—most well-known cryptocurrency platforms globally, with over 35 million users who trade virtual coins, including bitcoin, ethereum, and XRP. The New York Stock Exchange, BBVA, and former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit are among the San Francisco-based company’s many investors. Additionally, back in 2017, it was one of the top beneficiaries of the bitcoin BTC=BTSP boom, when the original cryptocurrency jumped from $1,000 to almost $20,000.

For the last several years, cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses have been in limbo in the U.S., as traditional banks have shunned the industry, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued regulatory guidance that many digital coins are securities, following up with enforcement actions when offerings of securities proceed without complying with securities regulations.

A new stock market listing for Coinbase would lend legitimacy to other companies building the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and potentially pave the way for future IPOs.



Direct Listing Might Be Pursued

According to Reuters, Coinbase may pursue a direct listing for its shares, instead of a traditional initial public offering. A direct listing enables a company’s existing shares of common stock to trade publicly on a national securities exchange without formally pricing a new block of equity through underwriters following a traditional book-building process.

In recent years, direct listings have become much more popular to achieve efficient pricing, as private companies became less dependent on IPOs as a fundraising mechanism.

Driving this move to direct listings, some of Silicon Valley’s most elite entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have become disenchanted with the underpricing of IPOs, which sometimes force companies going public to leave tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the table. This is because the customers of underwriters of traditional IPOs expect the IPO price to be discounted to true valuation to enable a first day bump in the post-IPO closing price of 20% or more.

Today, Coinbase is archetypal for the sort of company that might consider a direct listing: it is wealthy, having raised over $500 million during its time as a private company, and has a significant brand and following. Coinbase’s most recent private financing of $300 million valued it at $8 billion, according to data published by Crunchbase.

The direct listing process, contrary to the traditional book-building IPO, involves existing shareholders of a startup selling secondary shares to the public directly over a national securities exchange, instead of the issuer working with Wall Street underwriters to issue new blocks of shares, and those underwriters selling them on to their preferred accounts.

Like other recent businesses that have pursued a direct listing, including Spotify and Slack, Coinbase has a similar profile, with a high valuation, significant cash reserves and a substantial customer following and brand.



SEC Blessing Needed

Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam recently said the company is “spiritually” built to go public through a token offering, and many of its employees would be disappointed if it pursues a typical Wall Street IPO.

However, any blockchain offering, even a hybrid one, would depend on the blessing of the SEC. And, that could perhaps be a hard bargain given the SEC’s recent enforcement actions against Telegram and other token issuers.

The term “Coinbase effect” describes the price boost many cryptocurrencies have had as a result of being listed on Coinbase, which often occurs because Coinbase is the primary gateway to crypto for many buyers. So, given Coinbase’s status in the crypto industry, a successful IPO could create a ripple effect that boosts the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.

On the other hand, if Coinbase fails, crypto prices could plummet dramatically. Additionally, Coinbase may take into account the state of the broader cryptocurrency market in deciding when to go public—as cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile, and prices and trading activities have been in a slump.

Historically, Coinbase’s financial past has been opaque, with media reporting its 2017 revenue at around $1 billion, boosted by that year’s crypto-mania. In 2018, how Coinbase performed is less clear, although media reports described its diminishing performance alongside that of the currencies that it trades.

The company’s S-1 filing will provide insight into the company’s historical financial performance, allowing the public to see how Coinbase fared during various crypto-booms and busts.

Since being founded in 2012, Coinbase has raised a total of $547 million. In October 2018, its Series E round valued the company at $8 billion. As new companies like Compound and Kyber continue to use innovative methods to provide ownership of platforms to users, a direct listing could be a cost-efficient way for Coinbase to give users access to company shares.

With public markets at an all-time high and valuations for tech stocks out-performing the broader indeces, it’s not surprising that valuable unicorns are getting ready for a run on the public markets.

Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service, a federal service combating money laundering and terrorist financing, is reportedly planning to build a new analytics platform for tracking cryptocurrency transactions via artificial intelligence.

Dubbed “Transparent Blockchain,” the new system is designed to track the movement of digital financial assets and identify crypto service providers to fight illicit activity related to digital assets, local news agency RBC reported on Aug. 10.

According to the report, the new system is able to “partially reduce anonymity” of transactions involving major coins like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Omni (OMNI) as well as privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR).

As reported, the financial regulator has successfully piloted a prototype system to fight drug trafficking. The system was developed in collaboration with a major Russian research institute, the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the report notes.

The project has reportedly been funded by extra-budgetary resources so far, but would require additional funding. According to preliminary data, the Russian “Transparent Blockchain” will require about 760 million rubles ($10.3 million) from the federal budget from 2021 until 2023. The targeted customers of the new platform reportedly include major financial institutions like Russia’s central bank.

The news comes shortly after Russia officially passed its major cryptocurrency-related bill “On Digital Financial Assets.” Set to be adopted in January 2021, the new law prohibits the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a payment method. Earlier in August, Russia’s lawmakers passed new amendments to the law “On National Payment System,” banning anonymous deposits to major online wallets like Yandex, WebMoney, PayPal and Kiwi.",,https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-military/2020/08/11/bye-bye-bitcoin-marine-corps-bans-cryptocurrency-mining-on-government-devices/,"The U.S. Marine Corps has prohibited the use of cryptocurrency mining applications and other apps on government mobile devices.

The information made available by accounts on certain apps “is a privacy and security concern,” according to a Marine administrative message signed July 28.

Marines also are prohibited from having gaming, dating or gambling platforms on their government-furnished mobile devices, per the memo.

“Users are strongly encouraged to delete any apps from their personal devices that the US Government has deemed a risk,” the memo urged.

Lists of authorized and unauthorized apps will be made available to Marines, and prohibited applications will be automatically removed from devices by a management server.

Banning apps

Banning applications is not a new cybersecurity measure in the military.

Earlier in 2020 each branch of the military banned service members from installing the Chinese-made video sharing app TikTok on government-issued phones over fear that the app was being used by the Chinese government to collect data and spy on American citizens.

Cryptocurrency, favored by cybercriminals for its anonymity and ease of use, can be obtained through the resource-intensive process of mining. Because of the high processing power and energy costs associated with such activities, mining popular coins like Bitcoin can be unprofitable without a specialized setup.

Less popular coins with smaller networks, however, can be more easily mined on individual devices, cybersecurity expert Randi Eitzman told Marine Corps Times.

For this reason, criminals often “cryptojack” computers, infecting them with malware that will install mining applications and use a victim’s electricity and processing power for profit, FireEye reported.

Even if a service member were to use cryptocurrency mining applications on a government device without malware, they would still be using government resources for their personal gain.

“While some may try to argue cryptocurrency mining is a sort of ‘victimless crime,’ it is important to realize that it is theft,” Eitzman said.

Other branches of service have their own guidelines and lists of authorized apps, though none specifically outlaw the act of cryptocurrency mining.

The Army and Air Force use the Defense Information Systems Agency’s regulations.

“Users are only authorized to download approved applications, and users who download unapproved or third-party apps may result in the device being flagged,” a DISA spokesperson told Marine Corps Times.

DISA did not comment on what types of apps are or are not approved.

The Navy’s acceptable use policy limits personal use of government technology, prohibiting activities inappropriate for the workplace but allowing some personal use like posting items for sale on a forum, similar to a workplace bulletin board.

The policy prohibits any use of Navy technology that would reflect poorly on the Department of the Navy, said Joe Gradisher, spokesman for the office of the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare.

“Using the AUP as the guide then, cryptocurrency mining would not be a permissible activity on GFE (government furnished equipment),” said Gradisher.

The Marine Corps was not able to immediately respond to requests for comment or about whether or not there have been cases of Marines mining cryptocurrency on their government mobile devices.",2020-08-11 00:00:00

HODL – this means to hold (not sell) your cryptocurrency. The term became popular in 2010 when a typo in a Bitcoin forum went viral. The typo was retrofitted as an acronym for “hold on for dear life” due to Bitcoin’s volatility.

FOMO – fear of missing out is not only used in crypto, but the crypto version of it comes into play when you see a coin doing very well and are worried you may be missing out on an investment opportunity.

FUD – ‘fear, uncertainty and doubt’ is used to describe the bad news that seems to take hold when critics of crypto start talking. While FUD appears to be negative, it can be a boon to traders when the dips come around as they can buy crypto cheaper.

ATH – all-time high, or the highest historical price of a specific cryptocurrency.

Whale – a large crypto investor with a substantial amount of capital. Often whales are the market-movers for small coins.

Blockchain – a decentralised network that records transactions, much like a traditional ledger. These transactions can be any movement of currency, goods or secure data.

Pump and dump – the recurring cycle of spikes in price which are then followed by a huge price crash. Traders who pump buy large volumes and when other investors buy more, they dump or sell their coins at a higher price.

Fiat – conventional or government-issued money (your local currency).

Mining – the committing of computer hardware to process transactions on a blockchain (Bitcoin or otherwise). Miners do this to receive mining rewards paid in Bitcoin.

Halving – the Bitcoin halving is a recurring event built into its protocol which halves the number of Bitcoin awarded to miners. The most recent halving occurred on 11 May 2020.

Wallet – software with which you send and receive cryptocurrency. Remember, the coins are stored on the blockchain. The wallet contains the private keys that authorise the owner to send these coins to another wallet.

Exchange – an online trading platform where you can exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency or for fiat currency.

Bull run – a period when prices rise in the cryptocurrency market.

Bear run – a period when prices drop in the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin – Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency to ever be created and remains the world’s most popular and leading cryptocurrency by market cap.

Altcoins – any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. These newer coins are called ‘alternative coins’ or ‘altcoins’ as they are alternatives to Bitcoin.

Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that are pegged to more stable assets such as fiat currencies (US dollars, Japanese yen, etc.) to reduce price volatility.

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) – cryptocurrencies that are created or backed by a country’s central bank. It is expected that most countries will digitise their national currencies in the future. For instance, the South African Reserve Bank is investigating the possibility of a digital currency backed by the rand.

Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated crypto exchanges to get into the lending business, and the exchange is setting conservative parameters on the product, capping credit lines at $20,000 per customer and offering an interest rate of 8% for bitcoin-backed loans with terms that are a year or less.

Customers will need to fill out a brief application but won’t have to go through a credit check, however, and borrowers will be able to receive their loans in two to three days.

“Customers may use bitcoin-backed loans in different ways depending on their financial needs, including for large expenditures like home or car repairs, financing major occasions like a wedding, or helping to manage higher-interest personal loans or credit card debt,” Max Branzburg, head of product at Coinbase, said in an emailed statement.

The product is available in only 17 states but Coinbase is pursuing licenses in other states and countries to be able to expand its lending service, he said. A waitlist opened Wednesday afternoon, including the tagline:

“Have you ever needed cash for something urgent, like a car or home repair? In the past, you might have sold Bitcoin to cover it and incurred a taxable gain or loss. Now you don’t have to.”

The exchange says it won’t reinvest the collateral elsewhere and will keep the bitcoin at the exchange, unlike some crypto lenders who rehypothecate collateral or invest deposits into perpetual swaps.

Adding a lending product can be a way for exchanges to keep customer funds at the exchange instead of moving them elsewhere, said Joseph Kelly, CEO and co-founder of crypto lender Unchained Capital. Square’s bitcoin-friendly Cash App also announced this week that it is testing a lending product that will offer customers short-term loans of between $2 and $20.

Coinbase’s low interest rate will also allow it to operate in many states that would otherwise require additional licensing to avoid usurious lending practices.

“It’s a good bull-market product when customers have excess capital they’d like to do something with,” Kelly said. “We’ve almost never seen a monopoly lending market … I’d expect other exchanges to follow suit.”",2020-08-12 21:46:50+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/link-price-surges-32-to-overtake-bitcoin-cash-as-5th-largest-crypto-by-market-cap,"Disclosure

The world’s largest publicly-traded business intelligence company has swapped fiat for Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset, but the reasons behind it suggest that more big businesses will have no choice but to do the same.

Why did MicroStrategy choose Bitcoin, and will others follow?

Digital gold

In a press release issued on Aug. 11, CEO Michael Saylor went further than most by calling Bitcoin “digital gold.”

With no “ifs” or “buts,” Saylor unreservedly plugged the largest cryptocurrency over both fiat and other traditional safe-haven assets such as gold.

“Bitcoin is digital gold – harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it,” he commented.

That angle closely mimics some of Bitcoin’s foremost proponents, notably Saifedean Ammous, who in his book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” repeatedly explains that so-called “digital scarcity” puts Bitcoin in a separate league to any other form of money which has ever existed.

Like Ammous, Saylor also believes that Bitcoin’s very structure will ensure that its value will only increase with time.

He added:

“We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.”

Doubts over fiat’s future

Bitcoiners were particularly excited about MicroStrategy because it unashamedly replaced fiat currency for cryptocurrency.

Its purchase of 21,454 BTC for an aggregate price of $250 million late last month may not only be symbolic (given the total 21M BTC) but it also means that the company controls 0.1% of the total Bitcoin supply — something competitors will find increasingly expensive to replicate.

“MicroStrategy bought 0.1% of the Bitcoin supply. Very few companies will be able to copy this strategy,” What Bitcoin Did podcast host Peter McCormack tweeted in response.

For Saylor, there were multiple red flags that swayed him to turn to Bitcoin.

These were “among other things, the economic and public health crisis precipitated by COVID-19, unprecedented government financial stimulus measures including quantitative easing adopted around the world, and global political and economic uncertainty,” he said.

Continuing, he argued that what began as a result of Covid-19 would only cause further problems later on:

“We believe that, together, these and other factors may well have a significant depreciating effect on the long-term real value of fiat currencies and many other conventional asset types, including many of the assets traditionally held as part of corporate treasury operations.”

Cointelegraph has often reported on the detrimental impact of practices such as quantitative easing, and the voices urging consumers to abandon the fiat system en masse to protect their prosperity in the long term.

For Jason Yanowitz, founder of financial media network BlockWorks Group, Saylor’s reservations will ultimately spark trailblazing from the entire business sphere.

“MicroStrategy’s CEO said they bought Bitcoin to avoid inflation,” he summarized.

“Eventually every public company will do the same.”

This week, Cointelegraph noted that Bitcoin’s value appeared to be tracking central banks’ inflating balance sheets in 2020.

Bitcoin’s “Schelling point”

Finally, Saylor was highly complimentary about Bitcoin in particular — and did not mention that the company even considered any other cryptocurrencies.

“We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value,” he said.

Bitcoin’s eleven-year lifespan has seen it both remain the largest cryptocurrency and fend off multiple concerted efforts to undermine it.

As Ammous and various others often explain, Bitcoin has proven itself via this method — and alternative cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate that they can gain Bitcoin’s status and popularity.

Russia is reportedly developing a system using artificial intelligence to track and analyze transactions involving cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, dash, and monero. The system prototype has already been created and is currently being tested. This news followed the signing of crypto regulation into law by President Vladimir Putin.

Russian Crypto Monitoring System

The Russian government is planning a new system to track bitcoin transactions, local media RBC reported Monday, citing a letter to Parshin Maxim Viktorovich, Deputy Minister of Russia’s Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media. The letter, which it has seen, describes a plan for the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation (Rosfinmonitoring) to monitor cryptocurrency transactions.

Rosfinmonitoring is tasked with collecting and analyzing financial transactions to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. According to the letter:

Rosfinmonitoring plans to develop a system for analyzing cryptocurrency transactions using artificial intelligence (AI).

The project, called “Transparent Blockchain,” will “partially remove the anonymity of participants in transactions with cryptocurrencies in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Omni, Dash, and Monero systems,” the letter reportedly notes. The authorities, the Bank of Russia, and financial organizations will be able to use the system to monitor and analyze the movement of cryptocurrencies, identify service providers, and conduct investigations related to their illegal circulation.

The letter also details an “urgent need” for Rosfinmonitoring to monitor crypto transactions to give the government control over the circulation of cryptocurrencies. This is to prevent crypto assets from being used in “illegal schemes,” it adds, giving some examples of “drug trafficking, tax evasion, cybercrimes, contract killings, sale of information from closed databases, [and] financing of extremism.”

Furthermore, Nikita Kulikov, member of the State Duma’s expert council and founder of Pravorobotov Autonomous Non-Profit Organization, noted that Rosfinmonitoring plans to create an AI to “monitor the entire internet in search of illegal actions with crypto assets,” such as signs of money laundering and terrorist financing.

The prototype of this system has already been created and tested in the field of drug trafficking control, the letter details. It was developed by the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, one of the leading Russian research institutes specializing in physics. The Ministry of Internal Affairs became acquainted with this prototype and got interested in its use, the letter elaborates.

So far, the system has been developed without federal funding. However, to take it to the next level and provide it as a governmental service, preliminary data suggests that the project will require 760 million rubles ($10.33 million) from the federal budget: 440 million rubles this year, 230 million rubles next year and 90 million rubles in 2023.

A law regulating cryptocurrencies in Russia has recently been signed by Putin. It provides cryptocurrency with a legal framework but prohibits its use for payments.

The suit, which has already amassed more than $600 million in claims, accuses the firms of acting as a cartel in launching a coordinated attack designed to crush competition emerging from the nascent virtual currency sector in 2018 — when the social platforms enacted sweeping bans against the promotion of crypto assets and initial coin offerings.

After two-and-a-half years of preparation, Hamilton told Cointelegraph that he is ready to file proceedings within the 48 hours, highlighting that signups from claimants are set to close on Aug. 21.

Hamilton believes that the total value of claims against the firms could grow to as much as $300 billion.

Hamilton is the CEO of JPB Liberty — the legal firm that plans to bring the no-win-no-fee suit to court in Hamilton’s home country of Australia.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Hamilton recounted immediately recognizing the crypto ad ban as anti-competitive when it was enacted, drawing from his background in competition law.

After conducting extensive research into Australian competition law, Hamilton determined that the social media giants were acting as a cartel and it would be “pretty easy to prove it.”

Hamilton wrote to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and decided to start his own litigation funding company to back the case after the watchdog did not respond to his concerns.

In addition to Hamilton volunteering his labor, the suit has seen “a major law firm” contribute “hundreds of hours off the clock"" — with Hamilton emphasizing that “lawyers don’t work for free very much unless they really believe in something.”

Hamilton asserts that the wide-reaching crypto ad ban “completely killed off the [initial coin offering] ICO market.”

The lawyer described ICOs as offering “a new way for startup companies in the tech space to raise money” that bypasses the cumbersome regulated fundraising processes associated with the tech industry.

“This is a very big threat to Facebook and Google strategically, because, instead of having startups that have to fundraise all the way through and end up getting bought by Facebook or Google or someone before they become a competitive threat, [...] ICOs front-loaded the investment,” he said.

""Basically, people could raise all the money they were ever going to need to bring their product to fruition. [...] It actually meant that people could focus on development and improving technology, [...] rather than spending all their time fundraising,” Hamilton added.

Hamilton asserts that the impacts of the crypto ad ban were far-reaching, recounting that numerous claimants were left unable to secure investment after losing their ability to advertise on the internet’s largest platforms.

‘Absolute hypocrisy’

In light of Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project, Hamilton describes the firm’s strategy of “banning all of its competitors” from advertising on its platform “while secretly working on its own cryptocurrency” as “absolute hypocrisy” in clear violation of competition law.

Similarly, Hamilton highlights Twitter’s move to ban advertising from crypto firms while allowing Jack Dorsey’s financial firm Square to promote its crypto-friendly Cash App on the platform.

“This was an appalling attack on competitors. [...] At the same time as Twitter was banning crypto ads, Jack Dorsey’s Square’s Cash App was launching into crypto and became the number one app. They crushed their competitors and then provided little exceptions to the ad ban for their mates.”

Further, search engine optimization and online marketing professionals targeting the crypto niche found their accounts suspended — with Hamilton sharing the story of one SEO specialist whose Google Adwords account is still subject to a lifetime ban due to his work promoting crypto-focused clients at the time.

“Anyone who was in the Web 3.0 space and competing with Facebook and Google were crushed by this,” added Hamilton.

JPB Liberty is currently seeking funding from institutional litigation funders. If successful claimants will receive 70% of any future settlement, while 30% will go to the suit’s funders.",,https://www.wraltechwire.com/2020/08/12/flight-to-safety-bitcoin-becoming-digital-gold-as-dollar-weakens/,"Bitcoin is on a tear: The price of one bitcoin is now trading just above $11,500, the highest level in about a year. Bitcoin has surged more than 60% in 2020 and is up more than 180% from its mid-March lows of about $4,000.

What’s driving the bitcoin spike? Experts say much of it is due to the weakness in the US dollar. The dollar has plunged in recent months on expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero for years as a result of the financial disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“It’s a flight to safety,” said James Putra, head of product strategy for TradeStation Crypto.

Of course, safety is a relative term these days. Investors may think that bitcoin is a good hedge against a falling dollar. But the virtual currency remains exceedingly volatile.

Bitcoin’s intense swings could scare away some investors

Putra conceded that concerns about bitcoin hacks and security could make mass adoption of the cryptocurrency a difficult proposition for average consumers and investors. For example, a recent Twitter hack made it look like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian West and other verified accounts were promoting a cryptocurrency scam.

That’s why some experts aren’t convinced that bitcoin prices will keep climbing back toward their late 2017 record highs of near $20,000.

At some point, institutional investors (think hedge funds and other big money management firms) might cash in some of their bitcoin chips to take advantage of what Nick Cowan, CEO of GSX Group, dubbed an “obscene” rally since bitcoin bottomed in March.

“There is a herd who is in love with bitcoin that keeps pushing it higher. But is the smart money going to take a walk again?” Cowan said, noting that big institutions dumped bitcoin (along with many other assets) during the height of coronavirus fears earlier this year.

Still, Cowan conceded that the upward trend is the friend of bitcoin traders.

That may mean the bitcoin rally has legs after all — especially since the Fed’s recent moves are expected to eventually lead to higher inflation. In fact, prices are already edging up. The US government reported Tuesday that wholesale prices rose much more than expected in July.

More inflation could further weaken the dollar, push bond yields lower and provide another boost to bitcoin.

“Central banks have moved quickly to shore up the economy and some people are expecting a big post-Covid rebound,” Cowan said. “The bounceback could be quite quick.”

Digital gold for younger investors

The surge in bitcoin mirrors the rise of gold, which recently hit a new all-time high above $2,000 an ounce.

“Bitcoin’s rise is the same story as gold. Investors are looking for alternatives to stocks, bonds and the dollar,” said Will Rhind, CEO of ETF manager GraniteShares. “Gold is the currency of last resort, but bitcoin has cemented itself as an alternative to the dollar as well.”

TradeStation’s Putra agreed. He said many older investors are sticking with gold to hedge against the dollar’s weakness, although the under-40 set is skewing more towards bitcoin.

“Bitcoin is doing so well and it’s nice to bet on the fastest horse,” Putra said.

Rhind isn’t sure that bitcoin will ever be as popular as gold given that it lacks the commodity’s “universal appeal” because of its volatility.

But bitcoin is winning more converts — even in the corporate finance departments of Corporate America.

Business intelligence software company MicroStrategy announced Tuesday that it recently bought about $250 million in bitcoin to hold it on its balance sheet. Shares of MicroStrategy surged more than 10% on the news.

“This investment reflects our belief that bitcoin, as the world’s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash,” said MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor in a statement.

One expert said he would not be shocked if other companies soon follow MicroStrategy’s lead and add the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets.

“Any firm with a large corporate treasury to manage has to think more about how they allocate their assets,” said Zac Prince CEO of BlockFi, a firm that makes loans with cryptocurrencies. “This is probably the beginning of a trend.”",2020-08-12 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/38491/revolut-bank-losses-crypto-trading,"In brief Despite losses of $140 million this year, people are using London-based challenger bank Revolut more than ever.

Its crypto business is booming, with customers holding £93 million worth of cryptocurrencies at the end of 2019; about 2.5 times more than at the end of 2018.

Revolut currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Bitcoin Cash and Stellar, with a flat trading fee of 1.5%.

Times are tough for London-based challenger bank Revolut, which on Monday reported that annual losses in 2019 were triple those of 2018. Despite the losses, more people are using it than ever and its nascent crypto business has exploded.

According to its yearly financial report, customers held £93 million worth of cryptocurrencies ($121 million) as of December 31, 2019, about 2.5 times more than at the end of 2018, when the bank held £37 million worth of customers’ cryptocurrencies ($48 million).

And cash (fiat) holdings more than doubled: on New Year’s Eve, the bank held £2.281 billion in cash and cash equivalents; at the end of 2018, £903 million.

At the same time, the bank disclosed that its total loss for the year was £107 million ($140 million), more than three times its reported loss in 2018, £32.9 million ($43 million).

Revolut’s board members are confident that the bank, though running on fumes, will pull through. The board has “a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future,” they wrote.

As of December 31, 2019, the bank serviced 10 million retail users, almost triple that of 2018’s 3.5 million. And in February 2020, the bank raised $500 million; in June, another $80 million. And in July, it expanded its cryptocurrency offerings to the US.

The board wrote in a letter dated July 2020 that revenue has fallen due to COVID-19—it makes much of its money through currency exchanges, but interest has declined due to the pandemic. However, “some products, such as crypto trading, have been positively impacted by COVID-19 in the short term.”

According to data published by Revolut in May, UK crypto traders bought 58% less crypto per week in the second half of March, around the time when the government forced the country into quarantine and the price of Bitcoin cut in half.

But trading began to increase as the price of Bitcoin recovered from its mid-March crash. In the two weeks following April 20—the start of Bitcoin’s rise—the number of people buying crypto rose by 68% and the average amount of crypto bought increased by 57%.

Revolut currently supports six cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Bitcoin Cash and Stellar. Trading comes with a flat fee of 1.5%. It acts as a broker: these cryptocurrencies are owned by Revolut, which draws on its reserves with crypto custodians or “one of two currency exchanges.”",2020-08-12 18:15:10

John Demers, head of the Justice Department’s national security division, said authorities had seized cryptocurrency worth about $2 million, which he called “a significant dent” that will make “a big difference in their operations.”

Law enforcement officials said they had also blacklisted several million dollars more of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency tied to the terrorists’ online fundraising.

The social media fundraising for terrorism was as profitable as it was public, officials said, because the people raising and donating money wrongly thought using cryptocurrency would keep them anonymous.

“They become less cautious because they think there is a cyber-enabled veneer that protects them,” said one law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. “They’re not really trying to hide what they’re doing; they are in fact very open.”

As a result of that overconfidence, officials said, a number of people in the United States are under investigation in connection with making donations to terrorist groups.

In one of the cases announced Thursday, officials said the military wing of Hamas, al-Qassam Brigades, tweeted its call for donations and told supporters that giving bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies would be untraceable and used for violent causes.

Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI traced the funds back and ultimately seized 150 accounts tied to the al-Qassam fundraising effort.

The agents also got a court order to seize the al-Qassam websites and operate them covertly for weeks, allowing them to receive and redirect donations meant for the group while gathering more information about their donors.

Another online fundraising network sought to help al-Qaeda groups largely based in Syria, officials said. The organizations, according to the government’s court filing, laundered bitcoin and solicited donations using Telegram messaging channels and social media platforms. In some cases, the appeal for donations was couched as charity work when their messages made clear they were seeking money to buy weapons, the filing said.

In another case, authorities charge that Murat Cakar worked as a “facilitator” for the Islamic State and ran a coronavirus-related scam purporting to sell protective masks online. The FBI first became interested in Cakar years ago when a man in New York sent him money to support the Islamic State, authorities said.",2020-08-13 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-locked-defi,"The spot bitcoin market was fairly dull Thursday.

Little changed in the past day for bitcoin’s price. The top asset in the crypto market is back in $11,500 territory, where it was Wednesday, after briefly bottoming to $11,274 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.

However, the state of the options market continues to suggest that traders anticipate a bumpier bitcoin ride over the longer term, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “Implied volatility has edged higher, but only slightly. This shows that traders are still anticipating another big move, hence preferring long volatility strategies.”

John Willock, CEO of digital asset liquidity provider Tritum, expects bitcoin to move much higher before the year is done, but it will not be a steady upward trend. “There are quite a few psychological barriers to break along the way, especially once we get to $15,000, Willock said. “If our current pace keeps up I could definitely see $16,000 this year,” he added.

Swissquote’s Thomas also said the options market is currently seeing less institutional interest and more individual traders. He noted retail-friendly platform Deribit’s increase in bitcoin options open interest (outstanding contracts) versus more institutional-focused CME’s relative stagnation.

Deribit is an upstart crypto-only derivatives platform, while CME is a trading stalwart used by the biggest financial players for all types of commodities bets. “This shows that institutional players are standing aside, likely preferring to take a summer break,” Thomas said.

The top place for parking BTC in DeFI: Wrapped bitcoin, or wBTC, which allows investors to use the world’s oldest cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network. Over 21,000 BTC is locked in wBTC, by far its largest DeFi use.

Mark Hornsby, chief technical officer for crypto custodian Trustology, told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s role in DeFi could be bullish as investors feel comfortable about its role as the dominant cryptocurrency – and lock more of it inside Ethereum’s network.

“Due to its dominance, the bitcoin blockchain is an attractive proposition for DeFi,” Hornsby said. “Arguably, the lending and borrowing originating from these ‘wrapped’ instruments could bolster the underlying asset and, thus, bitcoin’s price point,” he added.

Several of the campaigns that came under scrutiny by federal authorities were detailed last year by The New York Times.

Seeking to send a deterrent message, Mr. Demers and other officials stressed that the government, including criminal investigators at the Internal Revenue Service, have developed tools and techniques that can identify people involved in so-called blockchain transactions that should give pause to would-be financiers of terrorism or other crimes.

As part of one of the investigations, officials said, the government took control of a website used for soliciting terrorist funds and operated it for 30 days, compiling information about the accounts making the donations and collecting the funds the donors believed they were sending to a militant group.

Investigations into the identities of the donors continue, they said.

The government also announced that it had taken control of four website addresses like Facemaskcenter.com and four Facebook pages that officials described as part of a scheme by a Turkish man they accused of being an ISIS facilitator, Murat Cakar. Officials said he tried to raise money for ISIS by fraudulently claiming he had large amounts of personal protective equipment, like N95 masks, to sell amid the shortage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.",2020-08-13 00:00:00,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902269353/department-of-justice-seizes-bitcoin-websites-from-terror-groups,"Department Of Justice Seizes Bitcoin, Websites From Terror Groups

Enlarge this image toggle caption Department of Justice Department of Justice

The Justice Department has seized millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency from terrorist organizations, according to court documents unsealed Thursday, in what the government called its ""largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency in the terrorism context.""

The Trump administration also said it seized several websites tied to an ISIS scheme to sell fraudulent face masks to the public during the pandemic.

All told the government seized more than 300 cryptocurrency accounts, as well as several websites and Facebook pages, allegedly belonging to members of al-Qaida, ISIS and the military wing of Hamas.

""It should not surprise anyone that our enemies use modern technology, social media platforms and cryptocurrency,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. ""We will seize the funds and the instrumentalities that provide a lifeline for their operations whenever possible.""

The fraudulent face masks involved a cyberscam but not necessarily cybercurrency. The department described ""a scheme by Murat Cakar, an ISIS facilitator who is responsible for managing select ISIS hacking operations, to sell fake personal protective equipment via FaceMaskCenter.com.""

""The site administrators offered to sell these items to customers across the globe, including a customer in the United States who sought to purchase N95 masks and other protective equipment for hospitals, nursing homes, and fire departments,"" the statement said.

The government seized the websites involved and said it is investigating whether the fraud resulted in any funds being sent to support terror efforts; the websites may also have been used for money laundering, the administration suggested.

The other two cases involved al-Qaida and Hamas soliciting cryptocurrency donations, either by appealing to their supporters or by impersonating charities.

Cryptocurrency's appeal lies, in part, in a potent mix of transparency and anonymity. All transactions are documented in a blockchain, a kind of ledger or record-keeping system that is visible to the public. But instead of being tied to a person's name or identity (such as money in a traditional bank account), the funds are only tied to strings of numbers.

This layer of pseudonymity has made cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin popular for some criminal transactions. But the Justice Department wrote in the newly unsealed court documents that ""it is possible to determine the identity of an individual involved in a [bitcoin] transaction through several different tools that are available to law enforcement.""

If someone exchanged bitcoin for U.S. dollars using a U.S.-based currency exchange, for instance, they might have revealed their identity in connection to that transaction.

Software that looks for ""clusters"" of transactions could then identify other bitcoin possessed by the same individual, according to the filing.",2020-08-13 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/daily-profitability-for-ethereum-miners-hits-over-2-year-high,"Disclosure

Known for being a pioneer in crypto derivatives and high-leverage trading, BitMEX typically facilitates the trading of $1 billion worth of crypto a day, per data provided by Skew. In a blog post, the firm said it would launch its new User Verification Program on August 28. BitMEX said that ""all customers will be asked to complete ID checks within the next 6 months.""

The exchange will require users to upload documents confirming their identity and location. In a sense, it is a departure from the crypto-native, libertarian brand the firm has been known for, but it could help BitMEX expand into new jurisdictions and avoid the ire of regulators. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched an investigation into the Seychelles-registered firm for allowing Americans to trade on the exchange, a source told Bloomberg News in July 2019.

In an interview with The Block, BitMEX's Ben Radclyffe said the firm's goal in adding new know-your-customer (KYC) procedures would help in the long-term by making things ""more transparent, accurate when discussing things with regulators and supporting those regulators.""

To be sure, it could serve as a headwind in the short-term, Radclyffe admitted. A number of new trading venues have sprung up in recent months that don't require the type of verification process BitMEX will now implement. Already, such venues have seized market share from BitMEX and the move could accelerate that, industry insiders say.

Still, Radclyffe says that certain clients have asked the exchange to roll out these procedures. He added that ""a decent proportion of our volumes is verified.""

As for the specifics of the program, the blog post said that users across the platform would have to go through a four-step process:

""Individual users will be prompted to upload a photo ID and proof of address, take a selfie, as well as answer a few multiple choice questions about source of funds and trading experience. It should take about five minutes to complete from start to finish. Corporate accounts will continue to go through the existing verification process, with our team ready to guide them through as quickly and efficiently as possible.""

The roll-out of KYC follows an earlier announcement this year that BitMEX would restructure its parent company. The new entity, 100x Group, sits on top of the firm's existing operations and appears to be looking to ""pursue a broader vision to reshape the modern digital financial system into one which is inclusive and empowering,"" as The Block first reported.

Radclyffe said that 100x's ambitions for BitMEX go beyond the listing additional cryptocurrencies.

""Expansion of our product has always been part of our strategy,"" he said. ""I think understanding our customer base better will allow us to be able to better tailor those product offerings.""",,https://fortune.com/2020/08/13/federal-agents-hamas-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-us-government/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-08-13 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/nigeria-using-bitcoin-trade-with-china,"Chukwuemeka Ezike sends thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoin a month in order to trade with Chinese exporting companies.

In return, he receives spare auto parts, construction equipment, and juices for a family business his father started more than 30 years ago. Ezike works full-time at Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi as its community manager but helps with his family’s business on the side.

He says bitcoin is faster than exchanging currencies the old-fashioned way. And he can use it to leapfrog bank limits of $10,000 a day, which he often needs to do.

Ezike doesn’t pay the manufacturer directly. Over WeChat, he works with a middleman named “Allen” who exchanges Ezike’s bitcoin for renminbi, China’s national currency, and then passes it on to the manufacturer. Ezike couldn’t divulge which companies he deals with, saying, “The Chinese are sensitive with the data that’s shared.”

He’s one of several Nigerians using bitcoin for this purpose. Ezike even helps other Nigerian companies make similar cross-border transactions with bitcoin.

Using bitcoin for global trade

In several ways, bitcoin makes sense for global trade. The currency jumps borders with ease, where other currencies encounter friction. If the counterparty is willing to receive bitcoin on the other end, it’s often faster and cheaper than legacy payments. But this can be a big “if” because bitcoin is a newer way of transferring money and people aren’t exactly used to it quite yet.

While bitcoin has these nimble properties, it hasn’t disrupted international trade and value transfer just yet, especially given the currency’s current limitations. If more people use bitcoin at once, the network becomes congested and payments slow down.

Behind the scenes, developers around the world are working on the Lightning Network to fix these problems so that more people, maybe one day even millions, can all use bitcoin regularly without seeing a spike in fees and sluggish transactions.

All that said, some Nigerians are becoming reliant on using bitcoin as a way to trade internationally, and are finding bitcoin has significant benefits over legacy financial systems.

Foreign exchange woes

Nigerian bitcoin entrepreneur Chimezie Chuta has another theory for why some are using bitcoin for trade with China and beyond.

Like most other countries in an increasingly globalized world, Nigeria imports a significant percentage of the goods that it uses. As Chimezie Chuta put it: “Nigeria is a very import-heavy country. Food industry, drugs, you name it, construction equipment, cars.” Much of these goods are bought from Chinese manufacturers. “Nigeria’s economy is heavily import dependent and China is a major import partner to Nigeria,” Chuta adds.

Nigerians have to struggle with this process, though. “Access to [foreign exchange (FX)] for importation by Nigerian business owners is highly limited because the [Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)] has limited liquidity to cater for everyone,” Chuta told CoinDesk.

If Nigerians want to reap the benefits of trade, they need to hunt down a way to exchange their naira (Nigeria’s national currency) for other currencies. In Nigeria, finding U.S. dollars or Chinese remnibi is not an easy task. “Importers typically rely on the black market for the additional FX needed and that comes at a very high price,” Chuta said. This phenomenon has been covered in Bloomberg, for instance.

This is one of the other reasons Ezike has turned to bitcoin as an alternative. “The hustle for [the] dollar and all that is quite a thing I love to avoid,” Ezike told CoinDesk.

With bitcoin, he can “take out all international banking routing processes,” he said.

Others are reaching the same conclusion.

“Chinese exporters have expressed willingness to accept bitcoin payments for their goods; hence, many business people in Nigeria find it more convenient to make such payments with bitcoin for obvious reasons,” Chuta said, adding that bitcoin is speedier, open and trustless.

More naira problems

Entrepreneur Monyei Chinazaekpele was able to buy clothes, COVID-19 masks and tests from House of Trippy in China, to resell to customers in Nigeria.

He decided to use bitcoin after experiencing mounting frustration with current banking limitations, especially their impact on global trade. “I was enlightened about the monetary policies on the ground. I was shocked to my nerve,” he told CoinDesk.

Chinazaekpele reiterated Chuta’s and Ezike’s point that foreign exchange is tough in Nigeria. “You can’t easily switch to other currencies,” he said, adding that he’s hopeful it’s just “a matter of time” before this situation improves.

“Basically, bitcoin is stress-free to use and honestly, the naira is not a good store of value,” Chinazaekpele said, pointing to the naira’s 12% inflation rate, which means the value of the currency depreciates by that much value every year.

Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, and sometimes the price goes down. But Chinazaekpele argues that bitcoin generally doesn’t have this inflation problem because over the long term the price has been going up.

Chinazaekpele’s also looking to buy a cashew processor with bitcoin, but he’s still working out the details with the factory, which is also located in China.

Keeping it on the down-low

All this trade with bitcoin is happening behind the scenes. Businessmen and women on the ground aren’t exactly eager to publicize that they’re using bitcoin for international trade. For one, the legality of cryptocurrency is fuzzy in the region.

The CBN has issued several warnings to banks. The latest in 2018 advised banks “not to use, hold or transact in any way with the technology.”

“In the bitcoin space we don’t know what reaction to expect, so we try to be a little bit discrete,” Ezike told CoinDesk. That’s why he doesn’t want to reveal the name of his father’s importing business. By only revealing his individual name, he’s less fearful that the Nigerian government will “attack” the business.

“We have had accounts frozen at some point due to bitcoin transactions,” Ezike said. “We had to appeal to re-open them.”

He added that it’s the same situation in China, which is why the people he transacts with there “ensure they [keep] a low profile.”",2020-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/74884/dave-portnoy-bitcoin-winklevoss-video,"Dave Portnoy, the pugnacious founder of Barstool Sports and, these days, a celebrity day trader, has bought some bitcoin with the help of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

As part of the operation, officials also seized a website and four Facebook pages that ISIS was using to sell fake personal protective equipment.

The seizure was just one part of a broader crackdown on the financial operations behind terrorist groups.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Federal agents have seized millions of dollars in bitcoin and more than 300 cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the terrorist organizations al-Qaeda and al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas group.

A press release, published by the Department of Justice Thursday, says its the government's ""largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency"" from terrorist organizations. The seizure was just a facet of a broader initiative to dismantle the financial operations of terrorist groups. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, and the Internal Revenue Service were all involved in the investigation.

Al-Qassam Brigades and al-Qaeda had regularly asked for cryptocurrency donations to support their cause, using social media to amplify their requests.

Al-Qassam Brigades first started doing so in early 2019 with a social media request for bitcoin donations that the group said would be used for violent causes. But they weren't anonymous as the organization wished — federal agents from various agencies were able to capture all 150 of the crypto accounts and redirect donated funds to bitcoin wallets operated by the US government.

And undercover HSI agents were able to seize 155 ""virtual currency assets"" connected to al-Qaeda.

The US also seized a website and four Facebook pages that ISIS was using to sell fake personal protective equipment. Officials said US customers could have inadvertently bought into the scheme by attempting to purchase PPE, which has been in short supply since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The investigation still has to go to court, at which point the government will decide if the funds will be forfeited. If it does, funds collected from the wallets ""may in whole or in part"" be donated to an organization that supports victims of terrorism.",2020-08-14 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-bounce-ether-options,"Bitcoin is up Friday while ether options traders are overwhelmingly bearish.

Bitcoin is back on the move Friday, breaking above $11,800 after a Thursday of relative quiet on the spot market.

“Crypto has had a good run for about three weeks in a row, since late July,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “There is a current resistance level of $12,500 for bitcoin, which looks pretty normal as markets, even crypto, cannot go up in a straight line day after day.”

Indeed, over the past month, bitcoin reached a high of $12,130 before dipping. That signaled a retrenchment will be likely before a move to further highs in 2020, according to Lifchitz. “A slight pullback could be even in the cards in the next couple of weeks but without any special bearish event, this shouldn’t be worrisome and the next major move from here should be up,” he added.

The bitcoin options market appears to agree with Lifchitz. Options with August 20 maturity show trader’s are giving bitcoin a 75% probability of being over $11,000, while only a 21% chance of hitting $13,000 by next Thursday, according to data aggregator Skew.

Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank, said some traders are probably concerned the current Ethereum-powered DeFi frenzy won’t be able to keep going for the rest of 2020.

A report Thursday showed that U.S. jobless claims fell to 963,000 last week, the first weekly figure below 1 million since March. But in the topsy-turvy logic of financial markets, the improvement was seen as neutral or even negative – since it might relieve pressure on authorities to speed up more trillion-dollar stimulus packages.

“The good news may be bad news now,” Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, told Bloomberg News.

Bank of America analyst Athanasios Vamvakidis acknowledged last week in a report that it was hard to tell if the dollar’s recent slide in foreign-exchange markets was due to ebullience over easy Federal Reserve monetary policies – or fears that the U.S. currency might be at risk of losing its status as the dominant world currency.

What’s striking is that, through it all, crypto traders have stayed almost unequivocally bullish.

Bitcoin is up 64% in 2020, more than double the gains for record-breaking gold. Prices for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, have tripled this year, thanks to the fast growth in decentralized finance, known as DeFi, and in digital “stablecoins” linked to U.S. dollars.

John Todaro, director of research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock, noted in an email Thursday that the market value of 10 digital tokens associated with DeFi has quintupled this year to almost $10 billion.

Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, wrote Thursday in a report that bitcoin might do well in any of the currently plausible market scenarios: “Bitcoin could be a ‘risk-on hedging-type asset,’ where it performs relatively well in thriving markets, yet acting as a hedge to global uncertainties, displaying financial attributes that fall in between that of equity and gold.”

Mentions are becoming more common in mainstream financial publications. The Financial Times reported Thursday that crypto hedge-fund managers have returned more than 50% through July, compared with the low-single-digit gains that hedge funds generated across traditional asset classes.

Barstool Sports president Dave Portnoy, who has gained a following this year for live-streaming profanity-laced trading sessions to millions of retail day traders, reportedly owns $1 million of bitcoin after meeting with the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.

It’s all become so bizarre that some cryptocurrency analysts acknowledge even they can’t really make heads or tails of the markets these days.

“Ultimately, when it comes to investing in this environment, the risk factor is through the roof,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers Thursday. “All risk metrics and meters have long been broken, so we really need to approach all investments with extreme caution right now.”

That’s probably the safest interpretation.

Bitcoin Watch

Price charts for bitcoin and ether. (TradingView)

Bitcoin printed gains for the second straight day on Thursday, despite risk aversion in the stock markets. Even so, the immediate bias remains neutral, with the cryptocurrency still trapped in an ascending triangle (above left).

The current consolidation could end with a bullish breakout above $12,000, as ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has jumped to fresh multi-month highs, confirming a bull flag breakout, or a bullish continuation pattern on its daily chart. That could be taken as a positive signal for bitcoin, as ether has recently led the market higher with its DeFi-led price rally.

Supporting the case for the bullish breakout in bitcoin is the recent surge in institutional participation. Open interest in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose to a record high of $841 million earlier this week and is up by over 100% over the last four weeks, according to data source Skew.

A triangle breakout, if confirmed, would shift the focus to resistance at $12,325 (August 2019 high). The short-term outlook would turn bearish if buyers fail to defend the lower end of the triangle, currently at $11,280. That could encourage selling and lead to a deeper decline toward the Aug. 2 low of $10,659.

Token Watch

XRP (XRP) – One of the largest cryptocurrency projects by market value is “still trying to find compelling uses” eight years after its launch, according to the Financial Times. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it may take “years” to develop “a lot of utility through XRP.” Michael Arrington, a crypto hedge-fund manager, told the FT that Ripple’s efforts to work with banks is “like Uber trying to disrupt the taxi industry by working with the taxis.” The XRP token is underperforming this year, up 45% versus bitcoin’s gain of 59%.

Band Protocol (BAND) – The much-awaited “oracle” token started trading Thursday on the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, according to CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson. The token’s price has surged more than 10-fold since the start of May, according to CoinGecko. Oracles provide price feeds for semi-automated DeFi lending and trading platforms. As previously reported by First Mover, the Band Protocol is being watched closely by cryptocurrency traders and analysts as a potential rival to Chainlink, whose LINK token has also jumped 10-fold in price this year, and is most valuable among digital assets with a market cap of at least $1 billion.

Yam (YAM) – The DeFi protocol was “a Frankenstein of other DeFi protocols,” according to the data firm Messari. It was a “blaze of social media-hosted meme-economy glory,” wrote Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics. The Defiant, a newsletter, dubbed it the “YAMpocalypse.” Here’s what happened with Yam this week, according to CoinDesk’s Will Foxley and Paddy Baker: The project launched Tuesday, and the next day prices for the token shot up to $160. Early Thursday, a critical bug was discovered that effectively killed it, and the market value tumbled by $60 million in 35 minutes. “The longer it takes you to do due diligence in this cycle, the lower your alpha,” Amentum Capital co-founder Steven McKie told CoinDesk.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced the “largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations’ cryptocurrency accounts” on Thursday, including millions of dollars and 300 crypto accounts.",2020-08-14 12:51:57+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/diversity-and-inclusion-in-blockchain-and-crypto-the-gender-aspect,"When we talk about financial inclusion, we have to think about inclusion for whom, in what context, and what inclusion itself means. One of the common answers when thinking about who needs to be “financially included” is “most currently unbanked people, who should ideally have access to commercial banking systems.”

But it’s not as simple as just asking, “How do we get unbanked people into the banking system?” because the banking system can be exploitative, and newly banked customers often wind up being the least-important customers or paying the highest fees, among other issues. There are significant limitations on the extent to which current systems are the right solution for a lot of people’s actual needs.

So, we have to ask tough questions and understand what the critically important problems actually are, particularly as we proceed upward on the hierarchy of needs. I think we need to examine access to crypto in this context.

Gender cultural code as the reason

A question I think about a lot is: Whom do we as a society empower to take risks? Generally speaking, the answer is young-ish white men from certain (privileged) educational backgrounds — noting that whether or not they actually completed college is usually not considered relevant. These individuals have access to not only certain kinds of privilege, but they also have the ability (engendered by cultural and social habits and norms) to accommodate an enhanced level of risk. Obviously, it’s not the case that “every white man can take on risk,” but the disproportion is clear: Young white men are founding more companies more often, and a reason for that is that they are culturally oriented toward thinking that it’s okay to fail, and it’s okay to take risks. They have a confidence that is culturally ingrained in them.

When looking across non-white cultures, risk-takers are still predominantly male. We as a society empower men to take risks that we do not similarly empower women to take. There are a million reasons for this that are coded in gender, and it is something we have to acknowledge before we can effectively address it.

The good news is that in the United States, the way we’re raising girls now is very different from the way I was raised. I examine and pay a lot of attention to this as a parent, as I have three young daughters. My daughters are definitely getting very different messaging from the media, from books and from their teachers than I received. Even though I was raised in a progressive household when it comes to gender issues, these external cultural influences are very powerful, and it’s wonderful to see how much progress has been made. I am not going to say that the job is anywhere near done, because gender roles are still very coded into our culture and language, but there is cause for optimism.

Mathematicians and the coder identity

Another thing I’ve been thinking about a lot is STEM education — specifically, why girls leave math and computer science in droves. I’ve been reading up a lot recently on the fascinating idea of decolonizing mathematics. There’s a whole social justice movement about developing an identity as a mathematician or a computer scientist. Culturally in the U.S., or even more broadly speaking in Western cultures, there is no notion of an identity of a female person as a mathematician. It is familiarity with these kinds of concepts and mathematical fluency beyond arithmetics that eventually leads to familiarity with coding, which then paves the way to being interested in careers in coding and logic.

Part of it is really starting to ask questions like, What is the cultural identity as a coder and how is that culturally ingrained? We still suffer from this idea that it’s some loner who puts on headphones and drills in. That isn’t necessarily wrong; introverts often do tend to gravitate towards coding, and there’s no question that some of these things are personality traits (though I’m an extroverted woman who loved coding, for the record). But personality traits do not have to be gender-coded unless we make them so, at a societal level. We can choose what cultural context we create around mathematics and coding.

I love that my daughters now have access to books with protagonists who are girls of color who are scientists. Series like that didn’t exist when I was growing up, where the protagonist is basically a girl of color, deliberately positioned against the supposed black-and-white of who is and isn’t a scientist to eventually solve mysteries using science. Representation matters, at every level. If you see something, it becomes easier to imagine.

Now, to get an education about crypto, whether as an investment vehicle in terms of money or from a tech perspective — you pretty much have to have minimum connectivity, or internet access. The access needs to be robust and stable enough to provide hours and hours of time to become an expert in the field. Moreover, there needs to be a family structure that enables a member to dedicate their time and can cover expensive network costs to facilitate the endeavor. Ideally, there should be access to an institution with people who can teach you, whether through online activities like streaming or downloading, or through a community, or by having access to experts, or whatever it might be. You have to have a lot of support around such an undertaking.

In a three-part documentary called Inside Bill’s Brain, Bill Gates demolishes the premise of Malcolm Gladwell’s nonfiction book Outliers. Microsoft’s founder said he used to just go down to his parents’ garage with friends and tinker around with robotics as a kid because he had access to it. Therefore, a lot of onboarding in tech is about what gets put in your path. The learning curve and its hurdles in tech are a lot higher for someone who does not come from an environment where these technological options are presented to them.

The opportunities presented to each person determine the likelihood of their understanding something like crypto. It’s difficult to imagine the success of some people in the crypto and blockchain space, myself included, if they hadn’t, to some extent, serendipitously fallen into a certain kind of environment. Nowadays, the needed environment to learn about tech, specifically crypto and blockchain, is more common, but it’s still far more prevalent in some places than others.

There is a woman named Fareshteh Forough, an Afghan social activist, who is the CEO and founder of Code to Inspire, a coding school for girls in Afghanistan. It’s a great example of an inspiring woman who wanted to develop a community for coding and robotics for girls. The school’s programs aren’t taught as traditional education, but as a trade that women and girls can do from their own homes, without even having to go out in public. They make money for their families using their skills, thereby making their education and work status culturally acceptable. Forough basically decided not to try to fight patriarchal culture. She accepted elements of it and said, “Nevertheless, within this patriarchy, I can still create opportunities for women and girls to engage in these kinds of activities. I can train them and they can actually create a livelihood.”

Forough is also looking at where the money goes. To prevent women’s wages from being taken by their male relatives, she is empowering some of them via crypto so they can create their own accounts and have their own wallets. In this way, they can create a separate, private, account for themselves, as their relatives rarely understand how crypto works and aren’t able to track it down. This access can lead to more opportunities and empowerment.

When you examine context, you can’t just assume that everything is equal. Part of what the progressive race relations movement in the U.S. has been so good at doing is saying, “Look, there are real differences here.” It is not the same thing to be raised black in an urban center and white in a suburb, to take one often-cited example. Economic privilege, obviously, is critical to access as well, in addition to ability, gender, etc. Imagine you’re dealing with a lot of other things, like unequal education and/or the fact that you have to regularly combat discrimination for not fitting into a traditional gender role or for not being neurotypical; these affect how you move through the world.

I don’t think that I’m saying anything particularly radical, but I do think that these things are not talked about enough in the blockchain space or are talked about quietly, in quiet corners or on the women’s or LGBTQ+ panels at a conference, rather than much more openly like other issues. So, what I sometimes do is focus on financial inclusion as a proxy, because so much activity is happening around that conversation right now, and I can push people to at least acknowledge that there is an issue and be willing to speak about it.

I work for the World Economic Forum, so my official professional view is one of objectivity. And I think that, objectively, we have a huge problem with inclusion in our society! Again, I don’t think saying that is novel or radical, because it is, or should be, obvious and self-evident. Once you accept and internalize this reality, you can get to a place where you start kicking out ideas and thinking, How do I address that? But it can’t be addressed without understanding the context.

Cryptocurrency and financial inclusion

Crypto is fascinating for a zillion reasons, one being that it came about because there was a really interesting problem and someone wanted to solve that problem. I don’t think that Satoshi Nakomoto, who invented Bitcoin, was thinking about inclusion in any meaningful way - I think it was much more about government surveillance issues and financial stability — that kind of stuff. I think it was a nerdy, libertarian sort of approach. Back in 2009, we were at a time of increasing dissatisfaction with the government’s approach to a lot of different things, and I think crypto has become a critical response to that. But I think it’s pretty safe to say it wasn’t originally about helping poor or unbanked people.

Now, we’re at a point of maturity with this technology: an inflection point to build something that can actually address these social issues and be a tool to help democratize systems. We, as a community and as an ecosystem, need to make a choice about which side we are going to come down on regarding equality in conjunction with how we use these new forms of technology and for which purposes we implement them. We need to think about user rights, and decentralization, what its pros and cons are, and the other benefits of all these opportunities.

Each of us as individuals has a set of choices to make. To start changing the world, you don’t have to wait for the right protocol or the right app or company. To solve these problems, individuals have to make a decision on their own about what matters to them — rights, equality, inclusion and other issues — which leads them to think about this stuff every single day and embed these ideas into emerging tech by asking themselves: Why is decentralization exciting? Why is it important? What is it about the system that isn’t working? What are the systems that we are building as alternatives?

How do we ensure that we’re really considering the points of view of unspoken-for individuals specifically and not guessing or building or colonizing yet another environment, like we did with mathematics? Because that’s the default. It’s the easiest thing to do, and it’s what will happen if we don’t pay attention.

Key Takeaways BitMEX is implementing mandatory KYC for all users, irrespective of trading size.

Moving in the direction of regulatory requirements can catapult the exchange into a playground for hedge funds.

This provides a unique opportunity for derivatives DEXes to fill BitMEX's shoes as a non-KYC trading venue.

BitMEX‘s new KYC policy requires all users to submit their personal information to the exchange by February 2021. This presents an opportunity for the exchange to cater to a broader customer base, and also creates a chance for DEXes to rise to the occasion and take over the non-KYC trading market.

BitMEX Moves Towards Regulatory Standards

The industry’s largest derivatives exchange announced KYC for all users starting from Aug. 28, 2020.

BitMEX, an exchange that boasts close to a trillion dollars in yearly volume, is a haven for whales who want to bypass KYC while still trading millions of dollars in crypto.

Many customers trade on the platform because of the no-KYC policy, and the latest move can act as a catalyst for rival Binance to usurp the futures and perpetual contract market.

The CFTC probed BitMEX for allowing residents of the United States to trade on its platform without registering with the agency.

The U.K.’s primary financial market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also warned U.K. residents against using the exchange. The derivatives platform is alleged to have “providing financial services or products in the U.K. without our permission,” per the FCA.

As regulators turn their attention to BitMEX, and crypto markets in general, the need to find a balance between crypto’s cypherpunk ethos and regulatory requirements is a must for the industry’s longevity.

Centralized exchanges like BitMEX are far more prone to regulatory action than their decentralized counterparts. Still, despite the newfound attention, many platforms including FTX Exchange and Phemex remain focused on serving traders.

Phemex, a derivatives exchange offering perpetual contracts with 100x leverage, told Crypto Briefing that:

“Our slogan, ‘Trade Simple,’ represents our desire to deliver straightforward financial services to as many people as possible. As such, we will continue to welcome and empower traders from all over the world while ensuring that our services always remain accessible.”

Conversely, decentralized alternatives are also gaining steam. Ethereum-based DEXes have encountered stellar growth in 2020. dYdX and Synthetix, DeFi projects building permissionless derivative trading, can emerge as the biggest winners from BitMEX’s KYC.

However, there is a bright side for BitMEX too.

With KYC implemented, the exchange will be able to establish itself as a legitimate player for large retail traders and institutions. By registering with the CFTC, it can continue to serve clients in the United States – an essential move to retain its vast liquidity.

As crypto matures and starts to attract attention from more institutional funds and corporations, BitMEX can cater to their requirements for both legitimacy and liquidity, thus continuing its fantastic growth story.

This leads to inflation and investors subsequently stashing their investment capital in long-term, stable investments. Historically, that has meant gold, but in the current economic crisis, gold has been joined by another long-term store of value: Bitcoin (BTC).

There are several good reasons for this. The United States Federal Reserve is handling the crisis terribly, and has responded to soaring unemployment numbers in the same way they always do: by printing money. Already, the dollar has lost 5% of its value, with predictions that this is only the beginning. The currency is expected to shed up to 20% in the next few years, according to analysts at Goldman.

Alongside this devaluation has come another threat to investors: deflation. With the value of dollar assets dropping rapidly and the worst yet to come, investors are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge against deflation. This appears to be the primary reason why Bitcoin has retained its value despite woeful news in other parts of the economy.

Are these investors correct, though? Can cryptocurrency act as a hedge against the dollar’s inflation? Let’s dive into it.

Inflation and deflation

For crypto investors accustomed to dealing with daily — or even hourly — market movements, it can sometimes be easy to forget about the macro-level trends that drive our economy. Inflation is one of these, and it’s useful to have a broad definition of the term before we look specifically at the role of crypto in beating it.

Essentially (and as you might remember from Economics 101), inflation generally comes about because of a general decrease in the purchasing power of fiat money. Many things can cause this loss of purchasing power: foreign investors pouring out of a particular currency, or even investors attacking a currency. Most often, though, inflation is the result of an increase in money supply, like when the Fed unilaterally creates billions of dollars and sends out checks to millions of Americans, for instance.

Deflation is the opposite. In deflationary scenarios, prices decrease as fiat currency increases in value relative to different goods and services. Again, there can be different causes for this, but it generally comes about due to tightly controlled fiscal policies, or technological innovation.

The global pandemic and inflation

The key point in these definitions is that inflation can only occur in fiat currencies — i.e., those not based on the market value of a tangible asset, but largely on confidence in growing gross domestic product. Since the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, the latter has been the basis of the U.S. dollar’s value.

Having a fiat currency gives governments a powerful degree of freedom when it comes to printing money, and supposedly when it comes to controlling inflation. However, when confidence in the government is low (as it is now), government spending programs can lead to inflation quickly getting out of control. In the 1970s, gold boomed because investors saw it as a hedge against the dollar’s rapid inflation.

This is similar to what is happening now. The global COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a massively inflationary monetary policy and aggressive expansion of money supply while prices in certain key areas such as food staples keep increasing due to supply shocks caused by lockdowns.

In this environment, it’s no surprise that gold is booming. There is, after all, only a limited supply of gold on earth, and so its price cannot easily be affected by government policy. Some crypto currencies, however, are also booming — apparently for the same reason. Billionaire investors are therefore lining up to compare Bitcoin to gold.

Bitcoin: A deflationary asset?

The reason why some forms of cryptocurrency can act as a hedge against inflation is precisely the same reason gold can: there is a limited supply. This is something that is often forgotten about by many, even those in the crypto space, but it’s worth remembering that many cryptocurrencies — and most notably, Bitcoin — are built with an inherent limit.

The 21 million Bitcoin limit means that at a certain point, there should be fewer Bitcoins versus the demand for them, meaning that in terms of value, the price per unit should increase as the supply decreases. In addition, the fact that Bitcoin allows investors to limit their exposure to government surveillance networks means that, in this time of low confidence in government, many people are moving their investments away from the U.S. dollar and toward crypto in order to avoid inflation and government tomfoolery. In other words, the comparison with gold investments of previous crises seems pretty apt.

But here’s the thing: It’s not completely clear that Bitcoin is, in fact, a deflationary asset. Or at least, not yet. While it is technically true that the supply of the currency is limited, we are nowhere near that limit, with most estimates putting the last Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. What this means, in practice, is that Bitcoin will be unable to act as a completely stable hedge against inflation for at least another 120 years.

Flexibility and stability

This might not matter that much, of course. One of the primary driving forces behind the rise of Bitcoin has been the combination of (relative) stability and (relative) variability that it affords. In this context, it’s heartening that investors now regard crypto as a stable hedge against an inflating U.S. dollar, but to regard crypto as merely a replacement for gold would be to miss the point: Cryptocurrency is far more than just a hedge.

(TSX: GLXY) (OTC: BRPHF), a financial services firm that specializes in digital assets, published its Galaxy Digital Holdings LP’s and GDH Ltd.’s financial results on August 14, 2020.

Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz noted that its Q2 2020 and year-to-date results “reflect a dynamic cryptocurrency and blockchain technology sector with multiple positive tailwinds, as well as our businesses’ cumulative investments in market relationships, differentiated solutions, and infrastructure.”

The Galaxy Digital Founder added:

“Whether it’s newly announced partnerships, consistent inflows into Asset Management, strong volumes in Trading, new mandates in Investment Banking or new and follow-on venture investments, Galaxy Digital is moving quickly to take advantage of the broad digital asset opportunity set.”

As confirmed in a release, Galaxy Digital began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”), after graduating from the TSX Venture Exchange. The company also finalized its share repurchase program in April of this year, which involved around 4.9 million shares valued at about 5.5 million CAD.

Galaxy Digital noted that Ian Taylor, the firm’s Head of Investment, will be resigning soon and Galaxy is now looking for a suitable replacement.

During Q2 2020, the Principal Investments team at Galaxy Digital finalized two new and four follow-on investments, which were valued at $5.7 million, the release stated.

The release further noted:

“Investments made during the second quarter bring capital deployed for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $19.9 million represented by 2 new investments and 9 follow-on investments. Investments made (including loans purchased) from January 9, 2018 through June 30, 2020 total $201.5 million and are represented by 37 new and 39 follow-on investments.”

The report added that as of June 30, 2020, Galaxy Digital Capital Management had $375.4 million worth of assets under management (AUM).

These include the Galaxy Benchmark Crypto Index Fund LP – $10.5 million (as “calculated per the terms of the fund’s partnership agreement”); Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, LP, Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund, LP, and Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund, Ltd. – $39.8 million; and Galaxy EOS VC Fund LP committed capital – $325.0 million.

The company reported a comprehensive net income of $38 million, which is significantly lower than the $113.8 million it earned during the same period in 2019. However, Galaxy’s recent performance is still a lot better from the previous quarter when the company reported a loss of $27 million.

Wall Street appears to have taken the news positively, with the firm’s stock rising 7% on August 14, 2020 (the day the results were made public).

Galaxy Digital’s management noted:

“The current quarter gain was largely a result of realized gain on digital assets, i.e. cryptocurrencies which trade continuously in the market.”

Galaxy also revealed that more than $1 billion in volume was traded via its over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The company claims that there was “an increase in actively trading counter-parties and trading volumes relative to the first quarter of 2020 despite seeing some near-historic low volatility in the space.”

Last year, Galaxy Digital recorded a net loss of $68.2 million during Q3 2019.

This week news.Bitcoin.com spoke with Jennifer Harding Marlin from the St. Kitts & Nevis islands law firm JH Marlin. The business specializes in all types of law practice and citizenship by Investment (immigration) is very popular. Marlin explained that recently, the company is getting “a lot of clients in the crypto space that are looking to obtain second passports.”

During the last few months, the whole world has been shaken by the Covid-19 outbreak and this has caused citizens to seek alternatives in certain careers, education, and even citizenship.

News.Bitcoin.com recently spoke with an expert when it comes to second-citizenship when we discussed the subject with JH Marlin’s Jennifer Harding Marlin. She recently told our newsdesk that crypto investors, in particular, have been looking to obtain a second passport.

News.Bitcoin.com has covered the many reasons to why crypto investors would want to obtain second-citizenship or consider renunciation. Marlin told us that with social uncertainty, economic distress, and political tension worldwide, people are on the move toward getting out of big nation-states entirely or leveraging dual citizenship.

“The law firm has been operating for three years and we’ve been getting an increasing number of citizenship by investment applicants who are really big into cryptocurrencies,” Marlin said.

The St. Kitts attorney is originally from Canada and moved to the Federation of St. Kitts & Nevis in 2014, as her law firm specializes in citizenship by investment and corporate law. St. Kitts & Nevis is the most popular destination worldwide to obtain dual citizenship and citizenship by investment has been in operation since 1984.

“It is the longest-running citizenship by investment operation in the world,” Marlin highlighted. She also said that the program price has dropped for a family of four from $195,000 to $150,000 until December 2020.

“A lot of crypto investors have become clients and they are based in much larger countries like the United States,” the attorney explained. “They are interested in getting a second passport for either a plan B or they are eventually going to want to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Or just have dual citizenship capabilities and then one day they may or may not renounce. Right now in the U.S., they have limited visa-free travel and a lot of countries are prohibiting U.S. passport holders too.”

Marlin further emphasized:

Obtaining a second passport by citizenship by investment gives people a way to have access to visa-free travel. With the St. Kitts & Nevis passport you have visa-free travel to over 140 countries.

Marlin detailed that some people choose to renounce their citizenship so they can no longer be subjected to certain taxes.

“In St. Kitts & Nevis there’s no such thing as personal income tax,” Marlin said. “As well as no gift and inheritance tax, so there are tax advantages. There are also tax benefits depending on which country the person comes from. For example, I am Canadian and I am a non-resident Canadian, I don’t have to pay taxes in Canada— I have to pay taxes where I reside.”

“So there’s an option to purchase government-approved designated real estate, for someone who wants to invest by citizenship by investment which starts at $200,000,” Marlin continued.

“The real estate needs to be maintained for seven years or there’s the option for real estate at $400,00 for a minimum of five years. The most popular option, however, is through donation to the sustainable growth fund. That’s because it’s often quicker and people don’t have to maintain real estate property,” she added.

Marlin revealed that a great number of individuals who are choosing to leverage dual citizenship stem from nation-states like the U.S. and Hong Kong.

Marlin said she thinks the current trend of crypto investors stems from individuals who follow people like Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver and other digital currency advocates who have second passports.

She also said that the trend probably comes from the fact that St. Kitts & Nevis is a freer country than most.

“Some people in the crypto space don’t have access to visa-free travel,” Marlin stressed. “So by acquiring a second passport they can have more access to visa-free.”

Marlin said the first thing people should do is get comfortable with their motivation. “Once you are a citizen you are a citizen for life, and you never have to visit the country,” she concluded.

The process can take up to six months and Marlin said that if someone is interested in dual citizenship they should be prepared to have a vast assortment of documents ready.

Check out the variety of articles hosted on nomadcapitalist.com that explain the process of dual citizenship in great detail.

How easy is tracking BTCs? It should be noted that Bitcoin is not really anonymous because all BTC transactions are kept permanently and publicly on the blockchain or ledger system, so it’s very easy for anyone to see the transactions and balances of any BTC address.

Chainalysis researchers recently explained in detail that as the rush for BTCs keeps increasing, the price will most definitely be affected. The report said:

“With more people looking to trade BTCs, which is only becoming scarcer following the recent halving, bitcoin moving from the investment bucket into the trading bucket could become a crucial source of liquidity

However, one would expect this will only happen if bitcoin’s price rises to a level at which long-term investors are willing to sell,”

When we look back to just a decade back, crypto was just a myth. But the success of cryptocurrencies has made some of us realize that investing early is the best option. However, the questions settle at what to invest in? Or which one among bitcoins, altcoin, and the stable coin will be best for trading and investing.

If you see bitcoin is the grandfather of crypto and have been in the market since 2009. And, the bitcoin industry is quite rich, as you know how high the prices are. Even though you do not we will discuss that later in this article. However, you do not always have to buy bitcoins for a stable coin. This means that you can open your world to all the proximate options and then choose wisely. Sometimes through stable coins, you can make millions, as they are not subjected to volatility.

Hence, your decision for investment entirely depends on the present market. It also includes your favorable options, depending on the payment you make and the term you choose. Let us first discuss the definitions to understand better what- Bitcoin, Altcoins, and Stablecoins are.

Cryptimi also shows a list of the top 5 cryptocurrency to invest this year.

What are Bitcoins?

Bitcoin is one of the first cryptocurrency that introduced the world to blockchain technology. Bitcoin was introduced by a pseudonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Even to date, no one knows who exactly that person or group is or are. Since the very inception of bitcoin, only a few assumptions have come in light, proving nothing solid on who Satoshi is. However, the Satoshi we investors know is the smallest piece of bitcoin i.e. 0.00000001 ฿.

Bitcoin can be purchased using the bitcoin exchanges like bitcoin system. Once you make the purchase your digital asset will be stored in the unhackable blockchain network. The security that bitcoin provides is top-notch, however, there are some potential risks. Any investment has its share of risk so does bitcoin, if avoided wisely can assure you the safest transaction in the world.

The present rate of bitcoin is $11,250 on 8th May 2020; however, it is expected to increase in the future. Well, it is rising constantly there is no doubt about that, but it sure will reach millions in the next few years.

How to and when to invest?

If you want to invest in bitcoin, then you must consider spending over $10,000 in one go. The industry experts suggest that making investments that are for the long-term is the most profitable one due to the volatile market. But if you are not into the long-term wait plan then you can invest as day traders. Invest for a short time, then withdraw when the rate rises and continue with small trading for the time being.

What are altcoins?

The bitcoin alternatives are known as altcoins. This means that all the other cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. Most of the altcoins are a copy of the original bitcoin source code, but with alterations. The new altcoins to compete with bitcoin are coming up with new concepts for purchasers.

There are over 1600 altcoins in the market that you can choose from. Among these, the most famous ones are Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. The crypto engine website will provide you with altcoin options as well.

The present rate of some altcoins

Currently, Ethereum is $388.05, Litecoin is $57.44, bitcoin cash is $287.36, EOS is $3.05, and several others.

What are Stablecoins?

These are stable coins that are not subjected to market volatility. These coins are gaining traction in the crypto industry rapidly to offer a stable platform. These currencies are fixed mostly, unlike other cryptocurrencies like altcoins and bitcoin. These coins are stabilized by attaching it with other assets such as national currencies or gold.

The stable coins just like other cryptocurrencies are private, secure, and transparent. Some of the examples are Paxos Standard and Gemini Dollar that are powered by the US dollar i.e. regulated and approved by the Financial service department of New York State. Other than that, the most famous stable coin is Tether rated at $1.00, even this coin is powered by the US dollar.

Key Takeaways Manic yield farming events and sky high token valuations make identifying top DeFi projects difficult.

Crypto Briefing has created a framework that draws on governance and token distribution to measure which protocols are the most decentralized.

The critical obstacles facing most projects is that of token concentration and attracting token holders to participate in developments.

Identifying the top DeFi projects from most decentralized to least decentralized can be difficult. The task is made more challenging following meteoric token prices and bubble-like folly throughout the ecosystem.

From thousands to billions of dollars in just two years, projects that buckled down to build a resilient product have reaped their hard work’s rewards.

Despite this fantastic growth, however, addressing core obstacles that stand between DeFi and real adoption is necessary. The primary blockades? Governance and decentralization.

In its current state, decentralized finance only lives up to the second half of its name. Achieving true decentralization has yet to truly materialize, but for good reason.

At a time when these protocols are nascent and iterating core functionality, the founding team needs adequate control to be able to push upgrades in an instant. What emerges is a spectrum; decentralized iterations, some more successful than others.

There are protocols like Uniswap, for example, where the founders relinquished their control from the get-go. This means nobody can shut down Uniswap, but upgrades aren’t possible either. Conversely, protocols like Compound and Maker need their smart contracts to be upgradeable. Keeping the network’s development static is not a viable option.

Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, believes on-chain governance via a native token is the middle way for these iterative protocols to move forward:

“There is nothing wrong with off-chain governance and most of the things in life are governed off-chain. However, when it comes to DeFi protocols, on-chain governance does have value propositions as it allows the governance of executable code without any interference, empowering true communities.”

As these protocols start to mature, transitioning governance and power from a team of ten to a community of hundreds is vital. But for this to work, community members must have a strong incentive to act in good faith.

While influential community members are bound to exist, implementing measures to mitigate their control over the network is required. Thus, limiting their ability to form a cartel and capture the system.

With this in mind, there are two primary governance risks facing crypto protocols: Regulators stepping in to shut down a centralized feature of a project, or whales conspiring to stage a network takeover via a native governance token.

A final concern facing DeFi protocols is that of regulation. Unlike their centralized counterparts, most decentralized platforms don’t ask users for formal identification or other personal details.

Jake Brukhman, founder and CEO of CoinFund, told Crypto Briefing that:

“I don’t believe that DeFi and regulation are mutually exclusive. At the same time, I don’t think protocols themselves will need KYC: I see protocols as the information technology for transactions, and they will simply delegate compliance to the edges (users).”

By taking all of this into account to build a coherent framework to evaluate governance, three key aspects help determine where a particular project stands on the decentralization spectrum:

A method of gauging a community’s opinion and enforcing a decision that achieves consensus. The easiest way of doing this is by voting in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Incentivizing the community to vote in good faith. A native token that holds monetary value helps align the individual’s desire for profit with the protocol’s best interest. Equitable distribution of tokens to prevent concentration in the hands of a few actors who can collude and capture the network.

Let’s apply this framework to the top DeFi protocols to determine which is the most decentralized, and which is the least.

Ranking DeFi Protocols by Decentralization

Launched by Andre Cronje in February 2020, yEarn Finance is one of the most gripping projects in DeFi. The excitement revolves principally around the astonishing yields on yVaults, but it’s the grassroots governance movement that sparked further involvement.

YFI, the platform’s token, is perhaps had the most equitable token distribution since Bitcoin. There was no pre-mine or token allocation to developers and investors. Instead, the entire supply was up for grabs during yEarn’s liquidity mining initiative.

Whales with large amounts of capital to spare always dominate token farming events. YFI was no stranger to this as token concentration with large entities is reasonably high.

yEarn Finance doesn’t have a DAO for protocol governance but does use the YFI token for on-chain voting. Instead, yEarn relies on a 6-of-9 multisig held by various community members to implement proposals. Executing decisions through a multisig wallet isn’t the most capture-resistant way to manage the treasury.

Even in a DAO, 5-10 elected members enforce decisions. However, a meaningful difference is that plans to decentralize via a DAO will allow the token holders to veto executive decisions and remove DAO members.

For its fair distribution, alignment of governance and financial incentives with a token, and use of a community-owned multisig, yEarn Finance is the top DeFi project based on decentralization.

A top DeFi protocol with over half a billion dollars of locked collateral, Synthetix is taking extensive measures to decentralize control of the system.

After two years and multiple pivots, Synthetix decommissioned its governing foundation. In its place, the core team set up three distinct DAOs to ensure the smooth sailing continues.

The ProtocolDAO is the owner of all Synthetix smart contracts and is responsible for upgrades and new deployments. A few core members are responsible for executive decisions of this DAO.

The SynthetixDAO was initially just a multisig but transitioned into a full-fledged DAO in June 2020. This DAO is set to be fully operational in 3-6 months and will be responsible for treasury management. Compensating contributors, paying for Chainlink price feeds, and other such activities fall under this DAO’s purview.

Finally, the GrantsDAO funds public goods in Synthetix, such as campaigns for public awareness or intuitive dashboards for users.

The SNX token will soon be at the center of these DAOs, giving individual token holders power in the governance process. Token holders will be able to vote out elected DAO members, even overriding their decisions in certain circumstances.

On the topic of token issuance, the concentration of SNX tokens is not drastic, but it isn’t ideal either. Synthetix raised funds via a public sale, and all VC investors involved with Synthetix bought their stakes directly from tokens allocated to the treasury.

A sweeping revamp to Aave promises to put governance in the hands of token holders while improving the alignment between the native token’s value accretion and the protocol’s sound management.

The current LEND token is being migrated to AAVE with a reverse token split (like a reverse stock split) to reduce supply from 1.2 billion to 12 million. Additionally, three million new tokens will be created as ecosystem reserves, diluting existing investors by 25%.

Aave’s next era marks a DAO launch. The DAO allows for the implementation of proposals that reach consensus through on-chain voting. Staked AAVE tokens act as a backstop in the event of a deficit. Doing so entails receiving protocol fees as a reward for absorbing this risk.

Staked AAVE is sold in the market to the extent of the deficit to protect the protocol’s longevity.

This process will begin in the coming weeks, and Aave will no longer be governed solely by the founding team. This shift earns Aave a spot as a top DeFi project.

The original DeFi protocol, MakerDAO, is an established player and a pioneer of on-chain governance. Recently, the Maker Foundation migrated control of the MKR token over to the community.

Unlike the Synthetix Foundation, the Maker Foundation didn’t dissolve. Instead, it was demoted to being just another governance participant.

Changes to the Maker protocol is in the hands of token investors. Implementation of a proposal is only possible after ratifying it with on-chain votes. The DAO is now the sole decision-maker for Maker’s risk parameters and collateral asset inclusion.

However, voter apathy runs rife in the Maker ecosystem, with an average of less than 5% of tokens taking part in votes. Most votes get unilaterally swung in a particular direction because of whales with significant influence. Funds like a16z and Polychain Capital hold a substantial amount of MKR supply.

Information regarding the issuance of MKR tokens is hazy. Maker didn’t conduct an ICO. Instead, they slowly sold tokens into the market through various means.

Maker set the tone for DAO-based governance backed by a native token. However, the value accretion mechanism is to use cash flow from stability fees to burn tokens instead of rewarding users. So far, the burn mechanism hasn’t proved all that effective, as evidenced by MKR’s price.

MKR issuance does not have a cap, further eroding the value of burning tokens. New tokens are issued and sold to cover any protocol level deficits. A single instance of such a debt in March 2020 led to more tokens’ issuance than the protocol has ever burned since launching in December 2017.

The risk of dilution is serious for MKR investors unless they bid on the new tokens themselves.

This mechanic causes a minor disconnect between token holders and the governance process. The resulting mismatch between incentives and MKR holders is possibly the root cause of low voter turnout.

A recent DAO and governance token launch brings Curve one step closer to decentralization. CRV holders can vote to introduce an admin fee to the protocol and back the tokens with steady cash flow.

From a governance perspective, the DAO will facilitate on-chain voting for proposals. Employees and shareholders hold the majority CRV voting power at commencement. While LPs account for 62% of total supply, it will take years to accrue more votes than seed investors and employees because of Curve’s slow token release mechanism.

As a result, the team and shareholders will control the network with the majority vote in the early days. This dynamic is very likely to reverse over time, giving LPs more power in the future. Unfortunately, the botched token launch and concentration of critical votes place Curve low on the list of top DeFi projects.

The launch of COMP kicked off the liquidity mining circus this June and was a prime catalyst for the rise of DeFi.

Despite Compound’s startling growth in the past few months, there are concerns regarding decentralization.

Token distribution is almost the exact opposite of Synthetix. Instead of a public sale and allocation to VC funds from the treasury, Compound issued tokens directly to investors to raise capital; its liquidity mining program distributed tokens in the treasury to the community.

The distribution is an excellent idea from a business perspective but is not ideal for decentralization. Liquidity providers get the biggest piece of the pie with 42% of total supply, but shareholders and employees (current and future) also have a combined 49% supply.

Like MakerDAO, whales dominate voting on Compound. The top five voters own 10.12% of total votes; the top ten account for 15.1%. For reference, the network needs a minimum of 400,000 votes (4% of total votes) to pass a proposal.

Collusion between any three of the top ten will allow them to capture the network unless other whales step in to oppose them—this critical dynamic limits Compound’s ability to scale up this list of top DeFi projects.

More participation offsets this risk, which is not a flaw of the model but rather a result of COMP farmers sitting on their tokens without voting. Passing a proposal to give COMP holders a portion of protocol fees could vitalize governance.

As token holders’ financial incentive converges with Compound’s long-term growth, more COMP owners can be expected to vote.

DeFi: Minimizing Governance, Maximizing Decentralization

The ideal governance mechanism for a protocol is zero governance. But this isn’t sustainable in an environment that relies on innovation to attract new users.

DeFi’s big brands are starting to implement some form of decentralization. Obstacles are sure to arise soon, but mitigating them will help separate the wheat from the chaff.

Still, as it stands, the top DeFi projects based on decentralization are yEarn Finance, Synthetix, Aave, Maker, Curve, and Compound.

Most whales are publicly known investment funds and crypto companies, which dramatically reduces the risk of acting in bad faith. The ensuing reputational risk outweighs the benefit of seizing power in a crypto ecosystem.

But the point of decentralizing finance is to make sure no one can gain undue control of a system. So, while measures to avoid this scenario seem excessive today, they instill public faith in a protocol by guaranteeing nothing adverse happens tomorrow.

The motto of this decentralized movement is allowing access to everyone while prohibiting control from anyone. Successfully pulling this off will change finance as we know it.

The asset recently topped out at a new all-time high of $18 before receding and settling at its current level around $16. Considering the parabolic growth, analysts now fear a large correction is on the cards.

On its quick path to $18, LINK barely built any significant support levels other than some brief consolidation around $13. This means that any serious trend reversal could take the asset tumbling back down to previous resistance at $8.

Uncertainty has also been noted by blockchain analytics firm Santiment, which noted that many investors are moving LINK tokens onto exchanges. This is a common sign of investors preparing to sell should the market turn. For now, however, the overall crypto market remains particularly bullish and LINK is maintaining its position.

Why the growth?

One of the biggest reasons it seems LINK has been exploding lately is that it is used by so-called ‘yield farmers’ to buy tokens of a new defi protocol called Yam. YAM tokens are used by yield farmers to provide liquidity on Uniswap pools in the form of staking to earn rewards. However, the project ran into some issues two days ago due to a coding problem and now appears to have collapsed completely.

Yam is not the only defi protocol to utilize LINK though, and as the defi space continues to grow, LINK will likely keep growing too. It also has very strong technology backing it and big names like Dave Portnoy of Barstools Sports getting involved. Not to mention Michael Anderson of Framework Ventures who predicted a LINK price above $25 back in April, when it was only a measly $4. While at the time that prediction seemed hopeful, it now seems highly likely.

Chainlink explained

Chainlink is designed to operate on the Ethereum network using its popular ERC20 protocol, amongst others. It’s essentially a decentralized network of nodes that help to connect data sources that are not on blockchains to data sources that are on blockchains. Hence the name, “Chain-Link”.

It does this by aggregating data using something called ‘oracles’ and then converting that data into a format that can be stored in blockchain smart contracts This provides a highly secure and automated method of using the advantages of blockchain technology for non-blockchain-based data.",2020-08-15 08:22:31+00:00

Toppled from their masters-of-the-universe pedestal in the early 2000s, they now eke out meager gains, dodge investor recriminations about fees and occasionally attempt to stay relevant by explaining to the rest of us where the current confusion is taking the global economy. True, there are some formidable brains and admirable initiatives among the former kings of finance. But so far, after a promising legacy and the occasional shining moment, this has not been their decade.

This week Eurekahedge, which monitors industry health through a series of hedge fund indexes, reported average performance for July of 2.6%, and a year-to-date return of 1.7%. This significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (+4.7% for the month), Nasdaq Composite (+5.3%), gold (+10.3%), bonds (the long bond TLT index is up 4.4%) and, of course, bitcoin (+22%). The underperformance year-to-date follows a similar pattern.

But here’s an interesting twist: The Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index was up 21% in July, and 50% over the first seven months of 2020. That’s a nice performance. But aren’t hedge funds supposed to outperform the industry benchmark? The YTD performance of bitcoin to the end of July is 55% – in other words, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap outperformed crypto-focused hedge funds by five basis points, or 10%.

In hedge fund terms, that’s significant, not least because one of the main points of hedge funds is to take extra risk, get extra return and make benchmarks look boring.

So, is the story here the outperformance of crypto hedge funds compared to their traditional brethren? Or is it the underperformance of crypto hedge funds compared to the industry’s benchmark?

I think it’s the former, that crypto funds are outperforming non-crypto funds, a trend that is likely to continue given evolving market developments and sentiment.

The relative underperformance to bitcoin (and even more so to other crypto assets such as ether) does not dim the prospects for crypto hedge funds going forward.

Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of directly in the market is going to be a more attractive option for many investors even if the returns are slightly lower, because using a vehicle run by seasoned management is probably safer than direct market participation. Investors don’t have to worry about custody, best execution and liquidity crunches.

And some recent developments point to more favorable tailwinds for crypto hedge funds as the year progresses.

Visibility

First, we have growing awareness of crypto as an asset group. Mentions of bitcoin in the press got a bump with the halving in May, and have remained high since, as this chart from The TIE shows:

Media is still talking about bitcoin Source: The TIE

This exposure is likely to intensify over the coming weeks as inflation concerns spread. This week, listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy chose to invest half of its $500 million of excess treasury in bitcoin, as an inflation hedge.



Also, this past week Grayscale Investments* launched a TV ad that positions cryptocurrency as a natural evolution of money, and investment house Galaxy Digital took out a full page ad featuring bitcoin in big letters in the Financial Times. For an audience growing increasingly uneasy about monetary policy, price pressures and market fundamentals, these are hard to miss.

Volatility

Second, volatility is back. In the case of bitcoin, volatility was until recently trending sharply down from “typical” levels. While still lower than its 2019 average, the metric has turned upward again.

Not quite like old times yet... Source: CoinDesk Research

This may deter some investors, but hedge funds typically seek out volatility. Its return could entice more mainstream hedge funds to set up a crypto arm. According to a report in the Financial Times this week, some “blue-chip” names are looking to do just that.

What’s more, until recently, correlations among crypto assets were relatively high. By betting on bitcoin, you could with one investment pretty much count on a large part of the market’s performance.

Over the past few weeks, however, correlations have fallen, and given the growing attention on individual projects emerging in decentralized finance and other applications, this trend is likely to continue.

A less-correlated market means more opportunities for alpha Source: CoinDesk Research

That makes the case for professionally managed crypto portfolios even more compelling, as outperforming the industry’s benchmark becomes a more creative challenge when active asset selection has a greater chance of delivering less correlated returns.

Support

And third, the growing operational support for professional crypto investing is also an encouraging factor.

Institutional-grade prime brokerage services for crypto investors are still in their infancy, but some big names with sizeable balance sheets and professional street cred have entered the space. And some finance giants such as Goldman Sachs and Fidelity seem to be carefully moving towards offering similar services.

When names that hedge funds are already familiar with start to offer support for crypto investments, we are likely to see even more traditional hedge funds try the crypto market on for size.

Furthermore, July’s statement from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that banks can now custody crypto assets is another strong step forward in getting hedge funds comfortable with the asset class. Public comments submitted by industry participants, including banks, think tanks and crypto companies, indicate an interest but also a need for further clarification. As this clarification emerges over the coming months and years, we are likely to see first a trickle and then a flood of traditional financial institutions eager to cater to those hedge fund clients that are becoming active in crypto markets. And in a virtuous circle, any type of service that reduces settlement and trading friction is likely to boost hedge fund interest.

Redemption

Are these trends enough to restore the hedge fund manager to his or her former glory? Will crypto hedge fund managers become the new kings of the market? It’s unlikely, at least not in the same money-to-burn way.

With markets undergoing a profound transformation in their underlying philosophy and with fundamentals no longer a driving force in valuations, beating the market no longer has the same intellectual cachet that it had in previous decades.

Yet there is still cachet in spotting winning trends before the mainstream, and in being insightful and brave enough to back nascent technologies.

The redeemed hero of the 21st century may end up being a hedge fund manager after all – only the heroics will not just be based on wealth. They will be based on the courage to see beyond the typical manager’s toolbox, to acknowledge one’s own limitations when it comes to understanding finance, and to understand that change can be harnessed for good.

Supply misunderstandings

Crypto land is never short on drama. One of the many attention-grabbers this past week was what has become known as “supplygate,” in which it was revealed that there is no agreement on what the actual supply of ether (ETH) is. It turns out that different data aggregators display different amounts.

There's a difference... Source: CoinDesk Research

For some, this is a clear example of Bitcoin’s superior transparency, and even calls into question whether Ethereum works as a ledger. In my opinion, the comparison is pointless. Total supply is important, even if only for the purposes of calculating market cap, which in turn affects some crypto indices.

Also, there are genuine concerns that the lack of clear idea of the supply does make the network vulnerable to an “inflation bug,” in which a code error mines additional tokens. If you don’t know what the supply is, how do you know if it’s not what it should be?

Yet, the consternation is especially interesting for what it says about the different value propositions of bitcoin and ether.

To start with, while both Bitcoin and Ethereum run on proof-of-work blockchains, there are stark differences in how supply is issued and calculated. I’m not going to wade into the details here, but it helps to understand that Bitcoin has a relatively simple protocol-level method to get the current supply, while Ethereum has some technical differences that make extracting exact balances a lot more complicated and time-consuming. And with the ether issuance changing every 15 seconds or so, latency further complicates the attempt.

Even more significant is the value proposition of each. Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21 million is part of what gives it value. Ethereum doesn’t have an effective hard cap – therefore its exact supply at any given moment is not as relevant. It has never claimed to be a hard money, and while some insist that “ETH is money,” that argument is largely used in the context of the potential of decentralized finance.

To me, all this highlights the uniqueness of the concept of crypto networks. Circulating assets with active developer communities can prioritize different characteristics, which speaks to the innovation and potential disruption, not to mention the unforeseen use cases, of assets that have managed to accrue significant monetary value on the basis of adoption and faith. Long may the dramas rage, especially when they are as educational as this one.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

In spite of a worrying inflation report, the looming income cliff as a support package agreement is again delayed, and general pessimism regarding the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks, the S&P 500 continued its march upward, almost reaching all-time intraday highs at time of writing on Friday afternoon. European stocks, especially those linked to tourism, took a hit as new lockdown measures were announced in some areas.

There was some positive news on U.S. retail sales (at the cost of the hospitality sector), and U.S. unemployment claims fell below 1 million for the first time since March. But overall, the feeling is that the recovery has stalled in most major economies.

In spite of central bankers actually talking about inflation, gold had a bad week, falling almost 6%. Bitcoin held its ground, falling less than 0.1%, in the face of a bitcoin-gold correlation that has almost surpassed its year-to-date high.

A tale of two narratives... Source: CoinDesk Research

As bitcoin’s correlation to gold heads up, its correlation to the S&P 500 continues to trend down. Could this be yet another narrative twist for the cryptocurrency? Is it now more of a risk-off, digital gold play than it has been for most of the year so far?

CHAIN LINKS

Publicly traded business intelligence firm MicroStrategy put half of its excess treasury into bitcoin, investing approximately $250 million. TAKEAWAY: This is a big deal, not just for the size and not just for the fact that a listed company with over $1 billion in revenue has publicly bet on bitcoin as an inflation hedge. It’s also a big deal for the signal it sends to other companies that inflation might be coming, and that bitcoin is a good hedge. What’s more, the size of the bet turns MicroStrategy into a listed bitcoin play. Since the purchase was disclosed earlier this week in an SEC filing, the stock price has increased by almost 20%, a bump that other companies will take notice of. (As an aside, the CEO Michael Saylor is the author of “The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything,” so his conviction about bitcoin is not a shot in the dark.)

Caitlin Long, founder of Avanti Bank, gives more detail on the Avit, a type of commercial bank money or programmable electronic cash, issued on a blockchain. TAKEAWAY: I am fascinated by the emerging subset of bank-issued tokens, as they could become a significant feature of the settlement landscape of the near future, and as such, have a material impact on how markets work. The supply of fiat-backed stablecoins has surged over the past few months, as investors take advantage of the enhanced liquidity they confer. Yet the legal aspect of stablecoin settlement is still unclear. Bank-sponsored tokens, however, could cover that gap, and make settlements more efficient while enhancing market liquidity. Avit takes the stablecoin concept a step further in that it will be an entirely new token, backed by U.S. dollar-based reserves, but not a representation of a real-world asset.

Crypto exchange Coinbase will soon allow U.S. retail customers to borrow fiat loans against their bitcoin holdings. TAKEAWAY: Against the scramble from other big-name firms to get into the business of prime brokerage for institutional investors, this move underscores Coinbase’s retail-first strategy. Although the marketing stresses the efficiency of borrowing against bitcoin holdings for expenditures such as weddings, home renovations, etc. it could end up being used to leverage crypto positions – customers could use their bitcoin to borrow money with which to buy more bitcoin. The leverage is not much – loans are limited to the lesser of $20,000 or 30% of the bitcoin holdings. It is still notable, however, given relative scarcity of leverage opportunities, especially for retail clients on U.S.-based spot exchanges.

Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, has started listing ether (ETH) options with strikes above $1,000, and some traders are now betting the cryptocurrency will reach that price by year’s end. TAKEAWAY: Trading interest in ETH seems to be gathering steam, as open interest and daily volumes for ETH futures and options are reaching record levels. They are still significantly lower than volumes for bitcoin (BTC) derivatives, but the growth is notable and likely to continue as the Ethereum blockchain continues to move towards a systemic upgrade that will in theory solve scaling and cost issues.

Staying with derivatives, bitcoin futures’ open interest on the CME, often taken as a proxy for institutional participation in the sector, has reached $800 million, up nearly 120% from the July low of $365 million. TAKEAWAY: This makes it the third-largest bitcoin futures exchange in terms of open interest in the world, behind OKEx and BitMEX, and the only one that’s regulated in the U.S. As recently as a month ago, it was in fifth position.

Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group, crypto mining companies listed on Nasdaq, are up over 95% and 125% respectively over the past 12 months, significantly beating bitcoin’s 3% gain. TAKEAWAY: This highlights that crypto assets are not the only way to get exposure to the market. Riot Blockchain’s increase is in spite of Q2 earnings released earlier this week which showed a drop in mining revenue from a year ago. Listed companies also come with additional micro risk, however, and should not be seen as a proxy for the assets themselves. Hut 8, for instance, which announced Q2 earnings this week, has lost almost 50% of its value over the same period.

Jesus Rodriguez points out some of the challenges crypto assets present quant strategies. TAKEAWAY: These include the fact that the datasets are smaller than with traditional assets, with some trading histories counted in months, which makes it hard to build predictive models. Also, the crypto market’s relatively frequent “outlier” events and irregular trading patterns will confuse models. And models are further hampered by the poor quality and reliability of datasets, with many exchanges exhibiting fake volumes, wash trades or spoofing behavior.

Will Foxley reached out to exchanges, traders and funds for more insight into last week’s 51% attacks on the Ethereum Classic network. TAKEAWAY: Some insiders attribute the lack of a price plunge to the highly correlated nature of the smaller cryptocurrencies – others believe it’s because the network fundamentals are unchanged. As I mentioned last week, I believe that it could be because it’s already priced in. ETC has significantly underperformed most crypto assets over just about any recent timeframe.

India’s crypto trade volumes have soared since the Supreme Court of India lifted banking restrictions for exchanges in March, reaching an all-time high in July. TAKEAWAY: Given the sheer size of the potential investing population, India’s attitude towards bitcoin is worth keeping an eye on, as even a moderate uptick could move the market. Also relevant is the country’s experience with demonetization, and its relatively high inflation.

Podcast episodes worth listening to:",2020-08-16 21:01:52+00:00,https://defirate.com/bitcoin-wbtc-growth/,"“Bitcoins are being tokenized to use Ethereum faster than they’re mined” – Zack Voell. That’s right – 6,785 BTC got wrapped in the Wrapped BTC (WBTC) contract while 5,738 BTCs were mined this week. Bitcoin is making it’s way to Ethereum at an unprecedented pace.

Currently, the block reward for Bitcoin is 6.25 BTC per block, meaning roughly 900 are mined each day. In total, there is roughly 26,000 BTC locked in the WBTC sidechain, giving it a market cap of more than $300M.

The two main advantages of locking BTC into WBTC is that they can then be used in the wider DeFi landscape and traded with other ERC20 tokens on DEXs like Uniswap. The second, more plausible reason, as to why we are seeing such explosive growth is that they are being used in Yield Bouncers to earn interest on their BTC. Pools like Curve’s sBTC or the WBTC Balancer Pools provide users the ability to earn a very lucrative interest rate.

FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, confirmed that both their regular exchange and OTC desk are seeing a ton of new inflow.

Critics are not happy

Critics are not happy about this latest development as WBTC goes against the ethos of the space. When redeeming Bitcoin or WBTC, users have to go through BitGo. BitGo is a digital asset trust company and security company, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, therefore introducing a central point of failure which goes against the core values of DeFi. It should also be noted that when you deposit BTC to BitGo, users have to undergo KYC and AML onboarding along with your BTC. This further turns off many people who would have otherwise used their system.

Many critics have also pointed out that while this is good for the Ethereum ecosystem, this could have negative consequences for the Bitcoin blockchain. This is because with each halving, the block rewards are halved and miners become increasingly more reliant on the transaction fees. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC and sometime in 2024, that block reward will be cut down to 3.125 BTC. What this means is that if a huge portion of BTCs are locked in sidechains like WBTC, renBTC and pBTC, there is a lack of bitcoin circulating in the Bitcoin Blockchain and thus, miners do not get the transaction fees that they otherwise would have earned.

Bitcoin Competition Heats Up

While WBTC is the biggest player in the tokenized BTC space, it is not the only player. Ren Protocol is quickly catching up with it’s wrapper – renBTC – boasting a markcap of nearly $75 million USD. Many have rallied behind renBTC as it is a better alternative to WBTC because it is more decentralised and not reliant on any central custodian nor does it require its users to go through the intrusive KYC/AML procedure. Check out our coverage on Ren here.

With over 1600 #BTC transferred to #Ethereum, RenVM has processed 19.1 Million USD, its highest daily volume to date. https://t.co/MvmjrIIkbp pic.twitter.com/2wUoPpoVGs — Ren (@renprotocol) August 15, 2020

Bitcoin has its own Layer-2 sidechain called Lightning Network. However, it has failed to attract any major traction and sits at a mere Total Value Locked (TVL) of $12 million USD. This pales in comparison to WBTC’s Market Cap of +$300 million USD and even renBTC’s Market Cap of nearly $75 million USD.

What this goes to show is that the appetite for compelling yield is attracting many users to port their bitcoin over to Ethereum. While it should be obvious that there is a significant amount of risk associated with doing so, this ‘risk-on’ appetite is not one we expect to slow down anytime soon.

In the background, tBTC is quietly preparing for its relaunch after Keep Network shut down its trustless bridge to address bugs that arose from unprecedented demand.

Grayscale Investments announced that it has raked in record investments of $217 million the week its TV commercial campaign launched. The company’s crypto TV commercial kicked off on CNBC, MSNBC, FOX, and FOX Business. Following Grayscale, Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital places a full-page ad in the Financial Times.

Record Investment Week After TV Commercial

In less than a week after Grayscale’s cryptocurrency TV commercial campaign launched, the company says it has achieved the highest weekly investment inflows into its cryptocurrency products. Grayscale debuted a TV campaign entitled “The history of money” on Aug. 10. It aims to elevate awareness of the company’s brand and its cryptocurrency products. Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert tweeted Friday:

Grayscale had our largest fundraising week ever … $217 million invested into the Grayscale funds. Guess you liked the commercial.

Silbert said last week, “We’re going to bring crypto to the masses,” noting that his company’s national ad campaign would kick off on “CNBC, MSNBC, FOX, and FOX Business.”

Grayscale now offers 10 cryptocurrency investment products. The company’s net assets under management (AUM) on Aug. 14 was $5.9 billion. Its Bitcoin Trust continues in the lead, with almost $4.88 billion in AUM. Last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported that Grayscale purchased over $1 million worth of bitcoins in five days. Earlier this month, the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to obtain reporting status for its Ethereum Trust. Recently, Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust was approved for public trading.

Grayscale is not the only cryptocurrency company promoting bitcoin on mainstream media platforms. Last week, Galaxy Digital placed a full-page ad in the Financial Times that reads:

Now is the time to invest in bitcoin. In uncertain times, bitcoin is a hedge independent of the hegemony.

The company’s CEO, Michael Novogratz, has been a proponent of bitcoin; he recently said that he preferred bitcoin to gold. The billionaire investor has predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $20,000 by the end of the year.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin continues to consolidate near the recent highs of $12,113.50, which shows that the bulls are not closing their positions as they anticipate the uptrend to extend further.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The average directional index (ADX), a component of the directional movement indicator, remains strong above 38 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,357) is sloping up, which suggests that the uptrend is strong.

The BTC/USD pair has formed a pennant, which is a bullish pattern. If the buyers can propel the price above the pennant and the overhead resistance at $12,304.37, the uptrend is likely to resume.

This setup has a target objective of $14,956. However, the bears will try to stall the rally at $13,000 and again at $14,000.

Instead of the breakout, if the bears sink the pair below the pennant, a drop to $10,400 is likely. A break below this level will suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels and might signal a short-term top.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The positive directional indicator (+DI) and the negative directional indicator (-DI) are criss crossing and the ADX has dropped near to 18. This suggests a lack of direction on the 4-hour chart.

Currently, the price has turned down from the resistance line of the pennant, which suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this level. However, the bears have not been able to sustain the price below the 20-EMA, which suggests buying on dips.

A breakout of the resistance line of the pennant will signal that bulls are back in the driver’s seat. On the other hand, if the price sustains below the 20-EMA, a drop to the support line of the pennant is likely.

ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) remains in a strong uptrend with the ADX trading above the 53 levels and the 20-day EMA ($382) rising up. The +DI remains well above the -DI, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ETH/USD pair has rebounded off the breakout level of $415.634, which shows strong buying by the bulls at this support. If the bulls can push the price above $444.15, a rally to $480 is likely.

Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $415.634, a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. If the pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will again attempt to resume the uptrend.

However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, then a drop to $366 is likely. A strong rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears had pushed the price below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but they could not sustain the price below the $415.634 support, which suggests that the bulls are aggressively defending this support. If the bulls can now drive the price above $444.15 then the uptrend is likely to resume.

However, if the pair turns down from $444.15, then the price might consolidate in a tight range for a few days.

The ADX has corrected to below 23 levels, which suggests that the trend has weakened in the short-term. This also points to a possible consolidation in the near term. This view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below the $415.634 support.

EOS/USD

The ADX on EOS is below the 20 level, which suggests that it is not in a strong trend yet. However, the sharp rally on Aug. 15 carried the price close to the critical overhead resistance at $3.8811.

EOS/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Currently, the bears are defending this resistance level but the bulls are attempting to push the price above it.

If the bulls can sustain the EOS/USD pair above the overhead resistance at $3.8811, the momentum is likely to pick up. The next target on the upside is $4.4 and then $4.66. If both these levels are scaled, the rally can extend to $5.40.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $3.50, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($3.16) is possible.

EOS/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The ADX on the 4-hour chart has risen to above 41 level, which suggests that the short-term trend is strong. The +DI is above the -DI and the 20-EMA is sloping up, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

Currently, the price has rebounded off the 20-EMA, which suggests strong buying on dips to this support. The bulls will now try to sustain the price above the $3.8811 resistance. If successful, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum.

This view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-EMA. Such a move will signal advantage to the bears.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) broke above the overhead resistance of $3.96 on Aug. 10. Although the bears attempted to fake this breakout on Aug. 11 and 12, they could not sustain the lower levels, which suggests aggressive buying by the bulls on dips.

XTZ/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ADX has risen to above 28 level, which suggests that the trend is gaining strength. If the XTZ/USD pair rebounds off the $3.96 levels, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $4.50. If successful, the pair can rally to $5.5.

Contrary to the assumption, if the bears sink the price below the critical support at $3.96, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($3.62) is possible. If the pair bounces off this support, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. Below this level, the decline can extend to $2.6.

XTZ/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have held the $3.96 support. If they can push the price above the downtrend line, a move to $4.50 is possible. However, if the bears defend this resistance, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.

The flat 20-EMA and the sharp fall in the ADX suggests a balance between supply and demand. This view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the $3.96 support. If that happens, a fall to $3.60 and then to $3 is possible.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) broke above the overhead resistance of $5.423 on Aug. 12, which has pushed the ADX to above 30 levels. The +DI is above the -DI and the 20-day EMA ($4.97) is sloping up, suggesting an advantage to the bulls.

ATOM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Currently, the ATOM/USD pair has recovered from the intraday lows, which suggests strong buying on dips.

If the bulls can push the price above $6.604, the uptrend is likely to resume. If an uptrend resumes only after a one to three day correction, it indicates strong momentum. The pair remains positive as long as it sustains above the breakout level of $5.423.

The bears will gain an upper hand if the pair drops below $5.423 and sinks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will signal a lack of buyers at higher levels and could result in a deeper correction.

ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The ADX on the 4-hour chart has dropped to below 25 levels, and the +DI and the -DI are close to each other, suggesting a balance between the bulls and the bears. The 20-EMA is also flattening out, which is another indication of a consolidation.

However, if the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, a move to $6.35 and then to $6.604 is possible. The uptrend is likely to resume on a close (UTC time) above 6.604.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, a drop to $5.423 is likely. A break below this support will turn the short-term trend in favor of the bears.

Four of the top five South Korean banks have reportedly announced their plans to provide cryptocurrency services. The announcements came ahead of the crypto regulation that will soon go into effect in South Korea.

Largest Korean Banks Entering Crypto Space

South Korea’s largest banks have reportedly revealed that they will be providing cryptocurrency services. With the country’s crypto regulation going into effect next year, cryptocurrency has been attracting the attention of traditional financial institutions, particularly for custody services.

Shinhan Bank and Woori Bank have said that they are considering introducing cryptocurrency services ahead of the enforcement of the Special Money Act next year, local news outlet MTN reported Thursday. The Act regulates the crypto industry in South Korea in line with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Shinhan is the largest bank in South Korea with total group assets of $482 billion. Woori is the fifth-largest bank in the country.

NH Nonghyup Bank’s technology development team has also been working on a cryptocurrency custody service to allow the bank to store and manage customers’ cryptocurrencies. Nonghyup is the fourth-largest financial institution in South Korea by total assets.

KB Kookmin Bank applied for a patent earlier this year for a number of crypto services, including trading, financial reporting, asset management, consulting, advisory, over-the-counter brokerage, and custody. Last week, the bank signed an agreement with Hashed, Haechi Labs, and Cumberland Korea to further develop its crypto services. KB Kookmin is the second-largest bank in South Korea with total assets of $474 billion as of June.

Banks worldwide are increasingly warming up to the idea of providing crypto services. Recently, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) officially stated that national banks and federal savings associations in the country are authorized to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers. In Germany, about 40 banks have reportedly applied for a license from the country’s top financial regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), to provide cryptocurrency services.

Akon City, the $6 billion futuristic city that will be run on the akoin cryptocurrency, will resemble “Wakanda” from Black Panther. Akon says cryptocurrency will empower Africans to overcome hurdles, such as high inflation and government corruption.

Akon City Will Be Like ‘Wakanda’ in Black Panther

Senegalese-American star and philanthropist Akon has updated the progress of Akon City, a $6 billion cryptocurrency-run futuristic city in Senegal. Akon says his city will resemble Wakanda from the Marvel hit movie Black Panther in more ways than just its futuristic appearance.

He told TMZ last week that Wakanda has helped him secure investment for the project from investors and partners. “This movie literally made an idea of what Africa could really be,” Akon was quoted as saying. “It’s just ironic that I was already working on this before the movie came out, but it’s something that helped me a lot when I was trying to explain to explain to people what I was trying to do.”

The centerpiece of Akon City will be a 5,000-bed hospital, which Akon says will cost about $1 billion to build, the media outlet conveyed. Besides the hospital, the first phase of construction includes homes, hotels, schools, police and fire stations, an airstrip, a mall, a waste facility, a solar power plant, and all the other hallmarks of modern-day cities. Akon plans for the city to be “renewable” with a focus on solar energy.

U.S. engineering firm KE International recently awarded Akon with a $6 billion contract to build Akon City in Senegal. The company previously said it had already secured $4 billion from investors for the first two phases of Akon City’s construction. KE International is also building the $2 billion Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC), a green city based in Western Kenya with a 5,000-bed hospital that recently partnered with the Akoin platform. The complex is already 85% complete, according to Akon.

The Grammy Award-nominated singer expects phase one of Akon City to be completed by 2023. The entire city, running entirely on the akoin cryptocurrency, is expected to be completed in 2029.

Akoin Cryptocurrency

At the heart of Akon City is the Stellar-based akoin cryptocurrency. Akon aims for the coin to be used as a common method of payment allowing for easy exchange between Africa’s 54 countries so that citizens and entrepreneurs can engage in the digital economy with only a mobile phone.

The akoin cryptocurrency has its own wallet. It “allows users to trade amongst partnered cryptocurrencies internally … through a proprietary and private Atomic Swap technology that makes a direct transfer with all major cryptocurrencies, our partners’ alt currencies possible, without having to go through a major exchange,” the akoin website details.

Akon explained on a Binance virtual conference last month how the akoin cryptocurrency will empower Africans. Reiterating his stance that cryptocurrency “could be the saviour for Africa in many ways,” he emphasized that it will help them overcome key hurdles, such as high inflation, government mismanagement of funds, and corruption. Pointing out that many African fiat currencies suffer from rampant inflation, the singer noted that it is very difficult to exchange them into other currencies. For example, he said that when he traveled to his home country of Senegal, he was unable to exchange the West African CFAs into euros, which had led him to create his own cryptocurrency.

For ease of use, there will be an internal conversion system, allowing conversion between cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and prepaid cell minutes, which Akon says are exchanged as currency by many Africans. The akoin wallet app will also allow users to “learn, earn, spend, and save,” the singer said.

553 reads

@ anti-danilevsky Anti Danilevski Founder & CEO at Kick Ecosystem. Crowdfunding & Blockchain evangelist since 2009

Cryptocurrency is about to become more accessible, thanks to a new mandate by the United States Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). Now, National Banks and Federal Savings Associations “of all sizes” can provide cryptocurrency custody to customers, a report from The Block notes.

According to the letter, these spaces have had permission to store digital assets since 1998, and cryptocurrency will be an extension of that. Of course, this could mean more than just holding wallet keys, though that is the primary intent of the service. The point here is that banks recognize cryptocurrency as a valid vehicle for investment, considering they’re now willing to protect those who hold them.

This is a massive step forward for Americans in the cryptocurrency space.

Before now, only specific businesses could hold cryptocurrency in custody. But as Nasdaq states, this could push massive corporations like Bank of America or Wells Fargo to provide cryptocurrency holding services to customers. If a bank offers these services, customers have much more reason to trust the often suspicious assets like Bitcoin.

While this letter doesn’t change the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency, it will change the world of crypto education forever. Many who are scared to enter the nascent space can be assured of their options. It can be risky to invest in cryptocurrency, no doubt, but knowing the smartest ways to do so can bring in millions. Banks can hire knowledgeable workers to bring that information to their customers, educating the masses and bringing tons of money into the space.

This isn’t to mention that crypto startups can start to thrive in the United States, given that they can finally open up business bank accounts - a limiting factor before this mandate was put into place. So not only will bankers be educating users on cryptocurrency, but startups and other emerging businesses will too.

It’s worth noting that this isn’t necessarily the intent of Bitcoin. After all, the asset was designed to circumvent banks, not to be utilized by them. However, if the masses are still struggling to get into the space, there needs to be some compromise. This is it. Even institutional investors - those who are somewhat educated on how to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies safely - are hesitant to enter the space. Crypto needs every chance it can get to pull in money and users.

Of course, this development is just one of many positive changes coming around the globe.

Late last year, the cryptocurrency space exploded at the news of China finally, publicly embracing blockchain technology. Since then, the country has established the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), a network of interconnected blockchain services that can be utilized by the entire region. Now, it is to integrate with popular blockchain networks Tezos, NEO, Nervos, EOS, IRISnet, and Ethereum. Developers on the BSN will be able to build decentralized applications for anyone in the world to use.

In Russia, the government has made it so cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is legal to trade within the country. It is, however, still illegal to use it as a payment method. Essentially, the government can tax the asset on trades, but will not allow users to make untraceable payments with it. While that’s a small step forward, it’s still a step towards adoption as the country plans a full regulatory bill regarding the technology.

While cryptocurrency is still in its nascent stages, the future has never been brighter. Countries are recognizing decentralized digital assets as legitimate forms of currency, implementing regulation, and assuring citizens of its validity.

However, Binance reveals that with Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto-asset in terms of adoption and market cap, you’d be “up 57% more than your Amazon gains.”

The Binance team notes in a blog post:

“Bitcoin’s meteoric rise over the past decade has put traders in mainstream markets on notice. It’s easy to draw comparisons between BTC’s stellar performance versus traditional stock indexes.”

According to Binance, when it comes to market price movements, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to “more closely” resemble the movements of traditional stocks. The exchange argues that before Bitcoin’s emergence, the stock market had been the preferred way (and still is) to grow investment portfolios in the long-term.

Going on to compare Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance to the S&P 500 (which tracks stock performance of 500 top US firms) or with the NASDAQ 100 (which is another major index that tracks the 100 top US companies), Binance reveals:

“Your $1,000 invested in Bitcoin (BTC) at the start of 2020 would have grown to $1,660, compared to $1,265 if you chose NASDAQ or just $1,029 for S&P 500…prices fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, but this is just one of the many instances that show Bitcoin’s competitiveness as an asset class.”

The Binance team adds:

“In 2017, when Bitcoin’s rally entered the public’s consciousness, stock analysts classified five tech companies as standard-bearers for blue-chip stock. These companies — Facebook Inc. (FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL), exhibited great performances in the stock market in the recent decade.”

Since January 1, 2020, a $1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) investment has appreciated by around 66% or about $660. Ethereum (ETH) has surged 204% so your initial $1,000 investment on January 1 would have earned you around $1,041.

Meanwhile, those who might have invested $1,000 in Amazon (AMZN) stocks would have made around $667 in gains. A similar investment in Apple, Facebook, Netflix, and Google stocks would have led to gains of approximately 24%, 50%, 66%, 44%, and 10% since the beginning of this year.

Due to the rise of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, Coinbase is planning to let certain US based customers borrow cash using Bitcoin (BTC).

Major Wall Street industry participants, including Michael Novogratz, a former billionaire hedge fund manager, has launched a full-fledged crypto merchant bank and offers several Bitcoin focused funds.

Despite this impressive growth, the crypto and blockchain space suffers from rampant market manipulation, and there’s not nearly enough focus on compliance as only 1% of digital asset derivatives platforms are properly regulated according to a new report.",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-defi-japan-smart-contracts,"One of the quietest yet best-funded bitcoin companies in the world is gearing up to enter the 2020 decentralized finance (DeFi) bull run.

In July the DG Lab conglomerate, which like Ethereum powerhouse ConsenSys includes both an investment arm and an adjacent software company, open-sourced its proposal for self-sovereign derivatives trading on the Bitcoin blockchain, using discreet log contracts (DLC). (The company is currently researching whether DLC can be integrated with the Lightning Network.)

These contracts turn bitcoin, the asset itself, into programmable money capable of a wider variety of functions.

This offers a stark contrast to the typical DeFi approach so far, which relies on “wrapped” representations of bitcoin or exchange platforms. The Silicon Valley startup cLabs recently acquired DeFi firm Summa, which spearheaded the bitcoin-on-Ethereum approach. Now it looks as though DG Lab, founded in 2015, is the leading incumbent exploring DeFi opportunities for Bitcoin.

“I’ve been working on a proposal to integrate DLC channels into the Lightning Network,” Crypto Garage researcher Ichiro Kuwahara said of his recent work. “We can establish many contracts without broadcasting transactions on the blockchain.”

DLC could one day tap the Lightning Network to execute business logic without clogging up the base-layer blockchain. The hottest trend among Bitcoin veterans these days is imagining DeFi functionality applied to the bitcoin currency through such layers. There are many opinions on how to approach this opportunity, from DLC to soft forks.

Competition

Not everyone agrees on how to use Lightning for smart contracts.

Bitcoin veteran Jeremy Rubin, who launched his Judica startup this summer, believes Blockstream’s Liquid Network, which companies like Crypto Garage use to experiment with such smart contracts, overcomplicates the construction.

“I think we can do it much simpler. … It’s solvable on-chain but can be done in [Lightning] channels as well,” Rubin said in an interview, explaining how his proposed Bitcoin soft fork could optimize the base layer for smart contracts. “I can construct this contract, which is a derivative, without you being online. I can make a valid contract then email it to you.”

These days, both ends of a Lightning transaction need to participate at roughly the same time for the payment to go through. (Or, at least, both need to set everything up in advance.) Rubin is arguing there’s a way to make it so one party can execute a consensual transaction. Public keys allow the other party to see, whenever they come online, proof of everything about the deal.

“It’s this notion of flow and conditionality that doesn’t currently exist in Bitcoin,” Rubin said. “[These 2020 DeFi projects] are about helping define commutes … a sequence of steps that can happen based on choices along the way.”

There are enough engineers working on DeFi options for Bitcoin that one of them might technically work, even if socially it doesn’t catch on. Only time will tell which ones find product market fit, and how that may or may not spur crypto adoption.

Japanese bulls

Stepping back, the DeFi bulls at DG Lab Fund raised over $93 million in 2019 and, according to the firm’s blog post, are raising a second fund in 2020.

The fund invested in DG Lab, the separate namesake startup, which simultaneously attracted investors from Japanese enterprises including the e-commerce giant Kakaku.com and the telecommunications provider KDDI. Meanwhile, the DG Lab Fund itself invested in River Financial, Arwen, Blockstream and Curv, to name a few, in addition to startups in adjacent sectors such as AI and security.

“We have several startups that are working with DLC. For example, Suredbits is one of the key players in this field and we are working closely with them,” said Shunichi Kimuro, senior manager at DG Lab Fund. “We wanted to show what is possible using the Bitcoin protocol by using our peer-to-peer [P2P] derivatives.”

Yet another startup called Crypto Garage, in which DG Fund did not invest directly, is using Blockstream’s Liquid technology to explore this type of smart-contract software.

“You define the outcomes of your contracts and create a transaction for each of the outcomes. And it can only be unlocked with one of the outcome transactions or with mutual agreement between the contract participants,” Crypto Garage engineer Thibaut Le Guilly said in an interview.

Rubin pointed out that even if he disagrees with Le Guilly on certain aspects these Bitcoin projects have much more in common with each other than with Ethereum DeFi projects.

Different goals

“There’s a really big gap between DeFi, as Ethereum is trying to do it, and P2P finance,” Rubin said. “Uniswap is really great. But they tokenize their liquidity pools. … We [Bitcoiners] are talking about finding a way for people to work directly with each other.”

Bitcoin DeFi projects aren’t using representatives of bitcoin, they want to enable traders to do tasks directly with bitcoin.

“There are about 20 people in the Bitcoin community working on tools, applications and specifications for [Discreet Log Contracts], including at SuredBits,” Le Guilly said in an interview. “[Traders] don’t have to involve an exchange.”

It appears as though Ethereum DeFi advocates offer a different interpretation of decentralization than their node-obsessed Bitcoiner brethren. Bitcoin advocates are focused on every user being able to participate in the network by running their own full financial stack, while Ethereum fans are more focused on the ability to offer their services from any data center around the world.

Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz said his infrastructure startup can easily move accounts across borders, thanks in part to a distributed team. This, from his perspective, is a slightly decentralized step away from Silicon Valley norms.

“If Amazon said you can’t run nodes, for example, we can very quickly and seamlessly move our infrastructure to other cloud providers,” Lallouz said. “Everyone at the same time would have to say the blockchain network is something we don’t support [to censor our customers] across the internet.”

While Ethereum DeFi experiments attract quick flashes of capital, losing considerable sums as advocates iterate, Bitcoin DeFi experiments seem comparatively modest. Yet, veterans know not to underestimate the Bitcoin development scene in Tokyo, home to the creators of self-sovereignty experiments including BTCPay and DG Lab. This period may just be the calm before a perfect storm.",2020-08-17 07:24:57+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-hits-12000-ethereum-xrp-breakout/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin seems ready to break above $12,000, which could propel its price towards $13,600.

Ethereum made a new yearly high as investors turn bullish around the upcoming ETH 2.0 upgrade.

XRP seems poised to enter a new uptrend, but everything depends on its ability to slice through $0.35.

After Bitcoin crossed the $12,000 barrier, market enthusiasm has pulled Ethereum and XRP along for the ride. Although all data points to a further advance, these three cryptos still face critical supply barriers ahead of them.

Bitcoin Prepares for a Major Price Movement

The flagship cryptocurrency has endured a prolonged consolidation period that began on Aug. 2. While its price has made a series of higher lows since then, the $12,000 resistance level continued to reject Bitcoin from advancing further.

Such market behavior formed an ascending triangle on BTC’s 4-hour chart. A horizontal line can be drawn along with the swing highs while a rising trendline developed along with the swing lows.

A recent spike in the buying pressure behind the pioneer cryptocurrency allowed it to break above the overhead resistance. Now, it could see shoot up nearly 13% based on the ascending triangle formation.

This target is determined by measuring the distance between the two highest points of the triangle and adding it to the breakout point.

IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model adds credence to the bullish outlook. Based on this on-chain metric, Bitcoin sits on top of a massive supply barrier that may allow the uptrend to continue.

Approximately 1.33 million addresses had previously purchased nearly 1.14 million BTC between $11,430 and $11,800.

This critical area of interest may have the ability to absorb any downward pressure as holders within this price range would likely do anything to remain profitable. They might even buy more tokens to push prices to reach higher highs.

Although the odds seem to favor the bulls on the lower time frames, the TD sequential indicator estimates that Bitcoin sits in overbought territory.

This technical index recently presented a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick on the 3-day chart. The bearish formation is indicative of a one to four three-day candlesticks correction before the uptrend resumes.

It is worth mentioning that the TD setup has been incredibly accurate at predicting BTC’s local tops and bottoms. It even presented a buy signal in early July, just before prices surged over 33%.

Therefore, this indicator’s current forecast must be taken seriously since a break below the $11,430 support could result in further losses.

Ethereum Faces Stiff Resistance Ahead

Ethereum’s social sentiment skyrocketed as speculation mounted around the Medalla testnet and the boom in DeFi tokens.

While the number of ETH-related mentions on social media went through the roof, large investors seemingly rushed to add more Ether to their portfolios. The spike in demand for the smart contracts giant was significant enough to push prices up to a new yearly high $445.7.

ETH reached this milestone alongside a new all-time high in positive social sentiment, but this is not necessarily a positive sign, according to Brian Quinlivan, marketing and social media director at Santiment.

“This is a classic case of the crypto community being simultaneously euphoric about a coin’s prospects with very few people willing to be bearish on the highly reputable project. But if history has taught us anything, buying into a euphorically viewed asset is the worst time to do so,” said Quinlivan.

The TD sequential indicator adds credence to the bearish outlook since it presented a sell signal on ETH’s 3-day chart. The bearish formation developed as a green nine candlestick, anticipating a one to four three-day candlesticks retracement.

Historical data shows that each sell signal the TD index provided since the beginning of the year has been validated and succeeded by steep price declines.

In the event of a correction, IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP model reveals there is a crucial support wall underneath Ether that could hold falling prices at bay. Based on this on-chain metric, roughly 700,000 addresses hold nearly 6.7 million ETH between $390 and $403.

Such a considerable supply barrier may have the ability to absorb some of the selling pressure. But breaking through it would likely result in a downswing towards $300.

On the flip side, the IOMAP cohorts show that the most critical resistance barrier ahead of Ethereum lies between $428 and $440. Here, nearly 600,000 addresses bought 1.8 million ETH. If demand for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is significant enough, it may slice through this hurdle and aim for $500.

XRP Poised to Enter New Bullish Cycle

Ripple made headlines after announcing that its business model would pivot towards expanding the utility of its native token, XRP.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse affirmed that the distributed ledger firm would aim to support activities far beyond the scoop of international remittances, just like Amazon branched out into e-commerce.

“Amazon started as a bookseller and just sold books. We happen to have started with payments. Two years from now, you’re going to find that Ripple is to payments as Amazon was to books,” affirmed Garlinghouse.

More emphasis will be placed on creating the necessary tools, services, and programs to empower developers worldwide to build their applications on top of XRP’s blockchain. Senior Vice President at Xpring Ethan Beard explained the move as shifting from “writing cheques to writing code.”

While the San Francisco-based startup strives to find compelling uses for its distributed ledger technology, data from Santiment reveals that the development activity on the network has been declining.

The behavior analytics firm takes into consideration the number of public GitHub events that a given project generates, such as issues, pull requests, comments, and repositories, to name a few.

Based on this on-chain metric, Ripple’s commitment to creating a working product and continuously polishing its features does not reflect the recent announcement. Since the beginning of the year, the development activity on the XRP protocol dropped from a score of 25 to 11.6.

It remains to be seen whether the new initiative will be remembered as one of Ripple’s unfulfilled promises.

Regardless, investors seem optimistic about XRP’s price action. The cross-border remittances token appears to have made a higher low on Jun. 27, for the first time since early 2018. If the buying pressure behind it continues to increase, it may have the ability to allow prices to break above mid-February’s high of $0.35 to make a higher high.

Under such circumstances, XRP’s multi-year downtrend will come to an end, and it will mark the beginning of a new bullish cycle.

On the Cusp of a New Bull Market

Market participants are growing overwhelmingly positive about the idea that a new bull market has begun.

This sense of optimism has been recorded by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI), which is currently hovering around the highest levels of “greed” it has been in over a year. Based on historical data, each time this fundamental indicator senses “extreme greed” among crypto enthusiasts, the market tends to suffer significant losses.

While the different support levels mentioned above have yet to be broken to add credence to the bearish outlook, the CFGI spells trouble. Now more than ever, it is imperative to implement a robust risk management strategy to avoid getting caught on the wrong side of the trend.

In fact, it has been worse due to significant liquidations happening above the resistance level creating massive wicks to the upside and downside in mere minutes. This latest attempt to crack $12,000 has a lot of trading volume but investors are not confident just yet. We would need to see Bitcoin trading above $12,000 for a few hours and then see continuation to really confirm the breakout.

Ethereum is in a healthy and sturdy bull run. The rally is robust because bulls have been able to establish clear levels of support on the way up. Ideally, a good rally should have periods of consolidation and sideways trading before going up more.

Tron is currently trading at $$0.0306 with a lot of bullish momentum behind it. Bears are struggling to find anything after an entire week of gains for Tron. The increase in trading volume has been significant but many indicators are now heavily overextended.

press release

Announcing the official launch of $RMPL, an ERC20 cryptocurrency with an elastic supply model, redesigned to solve unfair market manipulation and exploitation. $RMPL is currently on Uniswap, and will soon be released on several popular cryptocurrency exchanges.

RMPL is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol developed with an elastic supply model. The total supply of RMPL constantly changes via a randomized rebasing that adjusts the supply at a random time 0 to 48 hours after the previous rebasing. This randomized rebasing prevents the price manipulation and exploitation of these events by bots or whales, solving the problem that arose when rebasing followed a strict schedule, taking place at the same time every day.

Whereas scheduled rebasing creates an unprofitable and monopolized environment for the majority of the user base, randomized rebasing keeps the volatility in the token supply, not the price.

The base price target of $RMPL starts at 1 USDT with double the monthly adjustments for dollar inflation. This creates a more attractive coin to hold onto longer. Owning RMPL means owning a percentage of the network. As the market cap rises, so do the shares.

“Unlike some of our competitors who have gotten so big, they have no room to grow, $RMPL will open at a cost low enough for most users to invest at the ground level,” commented Ed E, co-founder. “And with its randomized rebasing, no one can preemptively manipulate the price.”

After its launch on UniSwap on Aug 2, 2020, $RMPL users traded over $8,000,000, netting it the honor of second place for 24-hour volume on the Ethereum-based exchange. To view on Uniswap, click here.

Upcoming RMPL announcements:

Exchange listings are currently being worked on and will be available in the coming weeks

The RMPL Cradle will launch later this month, offering a solution to incentivize liquidity provision on Uniswap

About RMPL

RMPL is a decentralized ERC20 cryptocurrency with an elastic supply model that reaches supply-price equilibrium based on randomized rebasing. Developed to protect against the market manipulation and bot/whale exploitation that traditional scheduled rebasing encounters, RMPL offers its holders a steady ownership in the network with holdings that rise in value with the market cap.

China’s southwestern Sichuan province, a mountainous region that is estimated to have over 50% of the Bitcoin network’s total computing power, has been hit by heavy rainstorms since last week, which peaked over the last two days.

The heavy rainstorms have caused electricity outages in parts of the region as hydro-plants stop generating power to help discharge the floods. Some counties are also experiencing telecommunication and internet breakdowns, said Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of PoolIn.

As result, impacted bitcoin mining farms in the region are forced to unplug from the network for the time being. It’s not clear when the situation will prove as the rainstorms are still ongoing.

Data from BTC.com shows the world’s top four bitcoin mining pools – PoolIn, F2Pool, BTC.com and Antpool, all based in China – have each seen their hashrates drop between 10% and 20% over the last 24 hours. The computing power connected to these four pools accounts for around 50% of the Bitcoin network’s total.

Pan said in a Weibo post Tuesday China time that in addition to mining farms being forced to unplug due to electricity and internet disruptions, some have also proactively paused operations ahead of time and evacuated their on-site staff for safety precautions.

According to the Xinhua News Agency, the accumulated rain volume in a dozen most-impacted cities in Sichuan between Aug. 10-15 alone has already surpassed the average August monthly volume in any year’s record.

Further, one major highway that leads to Sichuan’s mountain area, where most of the mining farms are located, is shut down due to severe floods and mudslides.

Meanwhile, bitcoin’s last three-day and one-day average hashrate has dropped to around 123 and 110 exahashes per second (EH/s), respectively. These numbers are down over 3% and 10%, respectively, from the seven-day rolling average around 127 EH/s, which is still at an all-time high.

The monsoon season in China every year brings abundant rain and thus excessive hydropower resources especially in the country’s southwestern regions, including Sichuan and Yunan. Such energy excess leads to cheap electricity prices that have been attractive to bitcoin miners.",2020-08-18 03:43:49+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/08/17/crypto-crimes-twitter-hackers-keyser-soze,"The high-profile Twitter hack — which saw malicious actors take over 130 verified accounts including Bill Gates and Elon Musk — managed to be both technically brilliant and incomprehensibly stupid at the same time.

It was a multi-person attack, deep inside the company’s infrastructure, using sophisticated social engineering to defeat 2FA-protected accounts.

But while the hackers were smart enough to defeat Twitter’s security, trawling through the internal Slack messaging system to unlock ever greater levels of access, they ultimately failed. Miserably.

Instead of, say, using Musk’s account to send Tesla market FUD to tank the stock price (and make millions shorting it) the hackers instead sold access to various accounts on the darknet for a few magic beans to some vanity-handle clowns, and then spammed out a two-for-one Bitcoin giveaway scam, netting a paltry $117,000.

And then they got caught.

“It doesn’t make sense as far as the sophistication of the attack,” says Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace. “The actual scam was ridiculous.”

Rather than an elite group of high-level professionals, the ringleaders were a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings who’d stumbled upon Twitter’s God Mode but had no idea what to do with it. The FBI tracked them down thanks to a series of total noob mistakes, including using their home WiFi without a VPN, and trying to cash out stolen Bitcoin using Coinbase accounts verified with their real drivers licenses.

It turns out that just like ordinary criminals, some technically adept cyber criminals can act like bumbling goons too.

Cleverness not required

Alex Lazarenko, Group-IB’s Head of R&D says that being clever is not a prerequisite of hacking into many crypto exchanges, which can have worse cybersecurity than non-finance companies.

“From our experience with our clients they are pretty bad with security,” Lazarenko explains in his thick Russian accent.

“There are not so many sophisticated attacks because the industry is not very much secure in terms of cyber security. A lot of people are getting into trouble with cryptocurrency because of simple mistakes.”

Most cryptocurrency scams don’t involve a crack team of hackers pulling off some ingenious and unique multi-level con — instead they just dust off hoary old scams and dress them up with a thin veneer of technobabble about ‘high yield investments’ and ‘sophisticated trading algorithms’.

“There’s nothing much new under the sun,” says Michael Cohen, Vice President of Operations at MyChargeBack, an American company that deals with retail crypto crimes. “You don’t have to be Dr Evil to scam someone via cryptocurrency. You can be a Mini Me.”

Scammers and thieves love crypto because there’s a perception that there’s no central authority to complain to, no way to reverse transactions, and the funds are difficult to trace. (In truth, most on-chain transactions are far from anonymous, and their traceability is often a boon to law enforcement.)

But cryptocurrency’s complexity means that even some of the smartest people can fall victim to their dumb tricks.

“The common denominator of all of them is a tremendous amount of inexperience on the side of the consumer,” says Cohen.

“You could have doctors, lawyers, investment CFOs, government officials. We see there’s no delineation between someone’s professionalism and education and the susceptibility to these types of scams.”

So how smart do you have to be to pull off various types of crypto crimes?

The Scam: Say Hello To My Little Friend

Criminal sophistication level: Grunts and goons.

Crypto extortion is a crude and unpleasant crime. At its most basic this involves a man with a shotgun bursting into your apartment demanding the passcode to your Bitcoin wallet.

Crude attacks can be defeated with similarly crude countermeasures however, and when this exact situation happened to a Norwegian crypto millionaire last year, he vaulted over the balcony of his second-floor apartment and escaped.

In a bizarre spin on the practice, The New York Times reported a group of men had ransacked the New York apartment of a man named Nicholas Truglia, and held his head underwater demanding his crypto logins. But it turned out that Truglia had made up the story, and in doing so he’d sparked an investigation by the police into his unexplained crypto wealth.

He was unmasked as The Bitcoin Bandit, the ringleader of a 25-person SIM swap gang, and ordered to pay $74.8 million in compensation to Michael Terpin, an investor in multiple ICOs and head of a blockchain marketing group.

The Scam: Show Me The Money

Criminal sophistication level: Dumb as a stump.

The oldest scam in the world is convincing people to hand over money now, with the promise of getting more money later.

‘Bitcoin giveaways’ on Twitter trade on this principle and have been at plague proportions for years. For a slightly more sophisticated example, head on over to YouTube on any given day and you’ll find tens of thousands of people watching a ‘live broadcast’ from someone posing as Ripple or SpaceX to promote the scam.

It’s lent credibility by screening on what appears to be a verified channel with hundreds of thousands of followers. Scammers typically use phishing emails to get a password to take over a gaming nerd’s verified channel. They then change the name from ‘Bob’s Gaming Channel’ to ‘Ripple’, and start screening old footage as ‘live’ to attract viewers. Both Ripple and Steve Wozniak have launched lawsuits against YouTube over the practice.

The Scam: We’re Not In Kansas Anymore

Criminal sophistication level: basic comprehension of Rock, Paper, Scissors

Moving up the scale, we begin to find crimes that require a modicum of technical ability. One method scammers use to steal passwords is to clone exchange websites to fool victims into entering their details.

The trick here is to use a domain name that looks identical to the real one, but isn’t, thanks to a ‘homograph attack’. This takes advantage of the fact that various letters in alphabets like Cyrillic and Greek look virtually identical to English.

In 2018, scammers set up a fake Binance site, complete with a reassuring looking padlock next to the address denoting an SSL certificate. But the letter ‘n’ had been replaced with a version that included an underdot (ṇ). Scammers pulled a similar trick by replacing the ‘r’ in Bittrex with one that included a cedilla (ŗ) which looks like a comma.

Once every couple of months Ledger is forced to put out another warning of a malicious browser extension pretending to be Ledger, seeking to trick users into entering their seed phrase. At one crypto conference in 2017 scammers went so far as to distribute fake Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets so they could later steal funds users deposited.

There are also simple malware programs devoted to diverting your funds to scammers — one Trojan called CryptoShuffler affects the cut and paste function, so that each time you ‘cut’ a wallet address, it pastes in the scammer’s destination address instead.

The Scam: I Know What You Did Last Summer

Criminal sophistication level: knows not to iron a shirt while wearing it.

Sextortion is where victims receive a personally addressed email from attackers who claim to have hacked their webcam and recorded them masturbating, demanding payment not to release the footage.

“They’re not spamming,” says Jevans. “They actually do have your name and they do have your email address. That’s why they’re convincing.”

SIM swapping involves a social engineering attack, whereby criminals contact a victim’s telecom provider purporting to be them in order to trick support staff to forward the victim’s number to a phone the hacker controls. This allows attackers to intercept two factor authentication text messages to steal crypto.

While phone providers have protocols to stop this happening, these are often easily circumvented, as hacker ‘Daniel’ told the online publication Trijo last year: “There are always ways to convince. For example, that you call and pretend to work at Tele2 (a Swedish telecom company) and ask them to help you forward a number. It does not take many calls before you have learned to pretend.”

The Scam: You Had Me At Hello

Criminal sophistication level: smarter than the average bear.

Tricking people into handing over money can be as easy as sending a few emails. In 2014, a hacker gained access to the email of an executive at BTC Media, which was in business negotiations at the time with Bitpay Exchange, and tricked Bitpay’s CFO Bryan Krohn into filling out his corporate email information on a Google doc.

This gave the attacker access to Bitpay’s internal systems, where they discovered that the exchange would provide Bitcoin upfront to SecondMarket with an agreement to pay later. The attacker then emailed Bitpay’s CEO from Krohn’s account, instructing him to send 5000 Bitcoin to ‘SecondMarket’… which was of course just the hacker’s wallet.

Bitpay lost $1.8 million and their insurance wouldn’t cover the loss as there technically was never a ‘hack’.

“The simplest attack is the best one you can do,” says Jevans. “There are still very simple attacks that can make you hundreds of millions of dollars a year by sending the right email to the right person at the right time.”

Cohen has noticed a big uptick this year in crypto scammers contacting victims via Tinder on dating sites.

“They enter into a quasi-relationship and show a screenshot ‘oh, this is my account, I do day trading,’ he says. “It’s kind of a honeypot, they bring them in that way. They log into their trading account and see $100,000.”

“Suddenly the person has forked over $50,000 via cryptocurrency after being baited into this online ‘trading’ enterprise.”

The Scam: Always Be Closing

Many crypto investment schemes turn out to be dressed up Ponzi schemes – named after Charles Ponzi, who came up with a legitimate arbitrage scheme initially, but then started to use the funds from new investors to pay ‘returns’ to existing investors and himself.

Cryptocurrency is the perfect disguise for Ponzis because a) it’s complicated and b) people really do get rich from crypto. Right now three of the top five biggest gas guzzlers on Ethereum are suspected Ponzi schemes.

“Back in the day before Bitcoin and other things were big, these scams were making a few hundred or thousand million dollars,” explains Jevans. “Now you look at things like Plus Token. These things have escalated with the ability to transfer money globally.

The PlusToken scammers made off with $3 billion by offering high returns to investors who thought they were funding the ‘development’ of an exchange and wallet. OneCoin brought in $4 billion with crypto mining and selling trader training material. Bitconnect was a ‘lending platform’ offering 1% interest per day for Bitcoin that hit a $2.6 billion market cap.

Even QuadrigaCX – whose founder famously died* suddenly with the only passcode to the exchange’s crypto wallet – turned out to be a collapsed Ponzi.

Off the shelf Ponzis

Despite the vast sums involved, Ponzis aren’t hard to set up. You can buy software to run a professional looking Ponzi scheme for a couple of thousand dollars on the web, hire a handful of people to do marketing, social media and answer the odd customer enquiries, and you’re up and running.

“(For) a billion-dollar scam, you don’t need that many people,” says Jevans. “You could probably do the whole thing with 10 people and a million dollars. Laundering the money however requires the services of professionals. “Behind the scenes they are very intelligent, you have to be very savvy, there’s no question about that,” he says.

“Here’s the thing I was once told,” says Jevans. “There’s no point stealing $10,000 and there’s no point stealing $10 million dollars.”

“Steal $100 million dollars because then you can afford the best lawyers and you’ll only do five years in jail and you walk out with $90 million. You only have to do it once and then you’re done.”

Ransomware is another game that anyone can play using software bought on the darknet.

“Ransomware isn’t a highly innovative field,” explains Fabian Wosar, the Chief Technology Officer for Emsisoft, which provides anti-ransomware tools. “The vast majority, if not all, of the attacks, use off-the-shelf attack toolkits.”

The Scam: I’m Gonna Make Him An Offer He Can’t Refuse

Criminal sophistication level: solves Rubik’s Cube with their eyes closed.

But while ransomware attacks can be carried out by bored high school kids, most of the real money is made by sophisticated, well-funded ransomware gangs. A gang called REvil came to mainstream attention this year after crippling Travelex for weeks with an attack on New Year’s Eve. The company eventually paid 285 Bitcoin.



The latest twist involves stealing confidential files during the attack and threatening to release them in order to ramp up the pressure to pay the ransom. When REvil stole the private legal secrets of celebs including Elton John, Robert DeNiro, Madonna from a New York law firm, they released 2GB of Lady Gaga’s file The firm still refused to pay, so REvil made their money auctioning off 756 GB of celebrities’ data on the darknet for Monero.

“They are technically sophisticated and where you can see just looking at the code that the people behind them have a great deal of software engineering experience and attention to detail,” says Wosar.

State-sponsored cybercriminals

Sitting near the top of the tree are North Korea’s hacking gangs. Crypto is the perfect way to evade crippling financial sanctions, and these hackers are state-backed professionals who face significant penalties for failure. There are tertiary-education training courses for DPRK hackers at Kim Chaek University of Technology and Kim Il-sung University. In 2018, it was estimated that North Korean hackers are responsible for more than 65% of all stolen crypto: They’re believed to have stolen at least $2 billion of cryptocurrency.

“Guys like the North Koreans — state sponsored cybercriminal gangs — they are the most well-resourced and sophisticated,” says Lazarenko. “Regular cyber-criminal gangs are just stealing money but those guys have other things to do than just stealing money.”

Jevans says North Korean gangs are the most sophisticated in terms of target choice, techniques and surveillance.

“We’ve seen them steal $250 million from one exchange in a swoop,” he says. “They’re attacking inside, targeting the employees and IT systems, breaking in, looking for vulnerabilities, figuring how the hot wallets work, the cold wallets, and then using those private keys to move large amounts out. We have evidence they’re doing infiltration into exchanges and sitting there waiting to do surveillance.”

Building a bot

The Lazarus Group’s March 2019 attack on the DragonEx exchange that netted $7 million is a good example of the lengths they’ll go to. The hackers set up a fake LinkedIn profile for ‘Gabe Frank’, the supposed CTO of a wallet company called WFC Proof and used the account to connect with DragonEx executives.

To lend the ruse legitimacy, they created a slick website for WFC and a social media presence for the company’s non-existent employees. They even built a working crypto trading bot for the DragonEx executives to play with. Of course, the bot was really just the delivery vector for malware to steal the private keys from users and the exchange’s cold wallet.

The Scam: And Like That… He’s Gone.

Criminal sophistication level: the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled…

But the cleverest and most ingenious crypto crimes are so technical and complex they sail over the heads of many people.

Even the experts are scratching their heads over an incident in June when two small value Ethereum transactions were sent with a combined gas fee of $5.2 million. Various people including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have suggested that hackers had gained partial control of an exchange’s funds, and were wasting millions on gas fees as leverage to force the exchange to pay a ransom. But Jevans isn’t so sure about that. “A technical attack is finding, for example, a smart contract that has vulnerabilities and exploiting them,” he says. “So that to me looked like the fallout of a technical attack.”

Lazarenko divides this category of crime into smart contract vulnerabilities, and source code vulnerabilities — where a flaw is exploited in software that runs the front end, or the server. An example of the latter saw Poloniex lose more than 12.3% of its Bitcoin in 2014. Owner Tristan D’Agosta explained at the time:

“The hacker discovered that if you place several withdrawals all in practically the same instant, they will get processed at more or less the same time. This will result in a negative balance, but valid insertions into the database, which then get picked up by the withdrawal daemon.”

But even source code exploits are old hat to Lazarneko, who reserves his admiration for blockchain specific smart contract exploits.

“A lot of old-fashioned ways of hacking into something works pretty well with cryptocurrency exchanges, like phishing, social engineering attacks. Nothing really new,” Lazerenko explains. “But with smart contracts vulnerabilities we can see a lot of new things going on because you have to use specific features of blockchains.”

DAO to DeFi

The most famous example of a smart contract exploit was the 2016 DAO hack. One of the creators of the DAO Stephan Tual actually identified the ‘recursive call bug’ a few days before it was used to drain 3.6 million Ether.

There have been a wave of attacks this year on DeFi projects including dForce/LendF.me, Uniswap, Maker and Opyn — which exploited a similar bug to The DAO attack. With some of the incidents it’s debatable whether these are even thefts or hacks, because the attacker is still playing by the (albeit badly drafted) rules. For example, in the bZx exploit in February, a very clever person was able to leverage the complexities in the ways DeFi protocols interact to make $318,000 in ETH. The person:

Took out a loan for 10,000 ETH from dYdX.

Used 5,500 ETH to collateralize a 112 wrapped Bitcoin loan on Compound.

Used 1,300 ETH to open a 5x leveraged position on the ETH/BTC pair on bZx’s Fulcrum trading platform.

Borrowed 5,637 ETH through Kyber’s Uniswap and swapped them for 51 WBTC, causing large slippage.

Swapped the 112 WBTC from Compound to 6,671 ETH, resulting in a profit of 1,193 ETH.

Repaid the 10,000 ETH loan on dYdX.

“It’s also a philosophical question: is that a vulnerability or not,” asks Lazarenko, “because … source code is the law and if the source code allows you to do something then you can do that.”

The biggest hack that will ever happen

Lazarenko says the example of the DAO – where even Buterin missed the bug when auditing the code — means that it’s conceivable that in future hackers could take down the ultimate target: an entire blockchain platform. While blockchain itself can’t be hacked he explains, “You have source code which is managing this, which manages the operations of miners which manages the operation of the peer to peer network,” he says.

“The biggest hack that will happen is when somebody can bring down a blockchain platform like Ethereum.”",2020-08-17 00:00:00

Portnoy has made a name for himself in 2020 as a popular live-streaming stock trader on Twitter, calling himself Davey Day Trader.

renBTC uses smart contracts to manage cross-chain conversions, as opposed to WBTC’s trusted third-party custodians.

renBTC now makes up more than 20% of all Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain.

Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC isn’t the only Bitcoin-to-Ethereum value transfer taking DeFi by storm.

Ren project’s renBTC has seen a nearly 200% increase—from $59 million to more than $176 million—in locked BTC transferred to the Ethereum blockchain since August 13, according to data collected from DeFi Pulse.

👀 @renprotocol sure had a good weekend. It jumped from ~$59M to $172M TVL https://t.co/kT0CnhrszU pic.twitter.com/rVpEwpjTmy — DeFi Pulse 🍇 (@defipulse) August 17, 2020

The substantial increase comes as DeFi continues to hit new heights in total value locked and market cap, placing renBTC firmly in second place as the favored method of porting Bitcoin value to Ethereum, behind Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The sharp growth is more evidence that Bitcoin holders are eager to get into the DeFi game on Ethereum, and are finding a variety of ways to do so.

RenBTC is a product of Ren, an open protocol designed to facilitate cross-chain liquidity transfers between blockchains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and more. Unlike WBTC, which uses a system of trusted third-party custodians to mint new WBTC tokens, renBTC and other Ren-based assets are generated or destroyed using smart contracts.

Singapore-based Ren was founded in 2017 and raised more than $34 million in a 2018 ICO. RenBTC was released in May 2020. The recent integration of Ren into MyEtherWallet may be responsible for some of the recent increase in interest.

The recent spike in renBTC issuance increased the total supply to more than 10,000 on Monday—that’s an average of more than 100 Bitcoin converted to renBTC every day since launch. By contrast, WBTC supply is now more than 28,750; a launch in November 2018 put the average conversion at around 45 Bitcoin per day, with the vast majority of those occurring since May 2020.

According to data gathered from Dune Analytics, the total number of Bitcoin now transferred to the Ethereum blockchain is more than 44,000, worth more than half a billion dollars. That equates to more than 1% of the total Ethereum market cap of about $47.8 billion, and more than 0.2% of the value of the total Bitcoin market cap of $222.8 billion.

Decrypt reported earlier in August that renBTC was approaching 10% of the total supply of Bitcoin locked on Ethereum. In just a week’s time, that figure has grown to more than 22%, even as the total supply of Bitcoin on Ethereum continues to expand across the board.

Such changes could be early indications that while WBTC is the go-to method of transferring liquidity today, the non-custodial renBTC may be the preferred option of tomorrow.",2020-08-18 21:36:14,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-rally-hedge-assets-low-yield-inflation-hedge-2020-8,"Reuters

Bitcoin rose above $12,000 on Monday as investors continued to hunt for inflation hedges amid near-zero rates.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency has rallied more than 200% from its March low as industry giants and retail investors alike scoop up the token.

Much of the rally has been fueled by tanking real yields. With Treasurys offering little return, investors have turned to hedges including gold and bitcoin to protect against rising inflation.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin surged above $12,000 on Monday and held the level in early Tuesday as investors continued to seek yield in unorthodox assets.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency traded as high as $12,476.7o over the past 24 hours, hitting its highest level since July 2019. Bitcoin has rallied past several key psychological thresholds in August after choppy trading throughout the summer. The upswing comes as the stock market closes in on record highs and investors brace for a potential rotation into safe-haven assets.

The digital currency is also boosted by tumbling real yields. The Fed's plan to hold rates near zero for the foreseeable future is driving real Treasury yields below zero and forcing investors to find healthy returns elsewhere. Some have piled into gold, as low yields erase the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding metal.

Others are experimenting with cryptocurrencies, anticipating their insulation from inflation will lift prices higher. Industry giants including Michael Novogratz and Paul Tudor Jones recently revealed growing stakes in bitcoin, with the former telling Bloomberg TV last week that roughly a quarter of his net worth is linked to the coin.

Bitcoin's latest advance comes on the heels of a strong year-to-date performance. The token is up about 70% in 2020 so far and has tripled from its March low.

Still, bitcoin needs to soar another 62% to retake its 2017 record of nearly $20,000 per coin.

Young, risk-loving investors have been propping up cryptocurrency for years, Novogratz said in a recent interview with ""The Tom Ferris Show"" podcast. Once big-money players enter the fray, more investors will take bitcoin and its uses beyond hedge-positions seriously, he added.

""Bitcoin has been a young man's game. It's been Gen Z and the millennials, it's been bought on Coinbase app or Square or Robinhood,"" Novogratz said. ""Those things aren't going away. Quite frankly, there are going to be more of them.""

NOW WATCH: Epidemiologists debunk 13 coronavirus myths",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/us-regulators-charge-airbit-club-for-running-crypto-mining-scam/,"US authorities today unsealed charges against what it alleges a fraudulent multi-level marketing scheme involving a purported mining business and money laundering ring. The regulators assert that AirBit Club has been selling illegal investment schemes as well as claiming passive, guaranteed daily returns that cannot be verified.

Participants of the scheme could also receive commissions by directly referring people who purchased the packages, and if their referred participants brought in other people in turn.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

The DoJ named defendants in this case as Pablo Renato Rodriguez, Gutemberg Dos Santos, Scott Hughes, Cecilia Millan, And Jackie Aguilar. The complaint identified dos Santos and Rodriguez as founders of AirBit Club. The pair are serial scammers that were fined $1.4 million three years ago for running another Ponzi scheme called ‘Vizinova’.

Scott Hughes, an attorney licensed to practice law in California, has also been charged with the same offence for promoting the scheme. He faces an additional charge for incorporating a company to promote the scam and helping to remove negative information about AirBit Club and Vizinova from the internet.

On top of these charges, prosecutors accused AirBit Club of deploying elaborate tactics to lure victims with promises of large returns on their investments in computing power to mine cryptocurrencies.

AirBit Club solicited investors to subscribe to their packages on the promise of returns paid for up to three hundred days. The money invested was allegedly used to pay for cryptocurrency mining equipment/software and its affiliates.

In its business model, a user signs for an AirBit Club account and buys a subscription or membership plan in cash. Each package has a different cycle, volume, and estimated profit.

Too Good to Be True

As originally introduced, investors in AirBit mining operations would reportedly earn more than 100% on their initial investment although anyone who took this risk could have faced a loss on the investment.

These promising profits were indeed too good to be true and did not factor in the ever-increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty. After doing the math, to make the scheme play out according to the plan, the bitcoin price would need to more than fourfold this year.

Details shared today by the regulator further highlights the deceptive nature of the mining pool. Not only was it being carried out without licensing, but also investors who tried to withdraw their money were met with excuses, delays, and hidden fees amounting to more than 50% of the requested withdrawal if they were able to make any withdrawal at all.

AirBit Club also allegedly ceased paying out investors and closed accounts of some clients when they attempted to withdraw some profits, citing “economic and financial crisis caused by (Covid-19).”

While they rewarded investors for recruiting new participants, the regulator describes these entities as fledgeling companies with little to no actual business operations and few prospects for profitable operations. Specifically, the company operates an affiliate program that pays commissions from the deposits of new investors.

“In one instance, AGUILAR told one Victim of the AirBit Club Scheme who was complaining about her inability to withdraw AirBit Club returns that she should ‘bring new blood’ into the AirBit Club Scheme in order to receive her returns,” the DoJ said.

AirBit Club has apparently refused to disclose where the mining takes place, what relationships it has to mining pools, or what hardware it uses. In other words, the regulator believes the entire operation could be nothing more than a ponzi-style scam.

In a related development, the SEC said on its website that Airbit Club was not registered with the regulator, nor was it authorized to solicit investments from the public. Court proceedings for that case are ongoing.",2020-08-18 21:16:14+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-bitcoin-omisego-portnoy-orchid,"Price point

Suddenly, It’s Not Just Bitcoiners Who Think the Dollar’s Going Down

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

By Bradley Keoun

As the news broke in recent days that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had bought shares in a gold miner, commentators immediately began to wonder if the billionaire investor might be betting against the U.S. economy or the dollar.

Bitcoin analysts and investors wondered why it took him so long, given the trillions of dollars of money pumped into the financial system this year by the Federal Reserve to help fund the ballooning U.S. national debt.

“The money printer working overtime is obviously causing Buffett and his board grave concern,” Mati Greenspan, of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday. “While Buffett is perhaps not so sure how to react to a world that no longer values bonds and government debt, others are sure.”

There’s a growing sense among members of the cryptocurrency community that their longstanding assessment of the traditional financial system as unsustainable is finally gaining traction among Wall Street experts and mainstream investors. If the concerns spread, it might buoy prices for bitcoin, which many digital-asset investors view as an inflation hedge similar to gold.

Goldman Sachs, which in May of this year panned bitcoin as “not a suitable investment,” hired a new head of digital assets earlier this month and acknowledged rising interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional clients. The firm warned in July that the U.S. dollar was at risk of losing its status as the world’s reserve currency.

Dick Bove, a five-decade Wall Street analyst who now works for the brokerage firm Odeon, wrote last week in a report that the U.S. dollar-ruled financial system could come to an end amid challenges from a possible multi-currency system, which include digital currencies.

“The case for bitcoin as an inflationary hedge and sound investment is being articulated with crystal clarity by influential people outside of our crypto bubble,” the digital-asset analysis firm Messari wrote last week. Buffett didn’t return a call for comment.

Dollar dominance on the wane?

Whether or not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the answer, there’s little on the horizon that might turn investors away from the gnawing sense that U.S. finances are becoming more precarious.

Goldman Sachs economists predicted in an Aug. 14 report that the Federal Reserve will pump $800 billion more into financial markets by the end of this year, followed by another $1.3 trillion in 2021.

According to Bank of America, there’s a risk investors might shift their “portfolio allocation out of U.S. dollar assets” to position for the “erosion of the hegemony of the dollar as a reserve currency.”

“A constitutional crisis is one dynamic that could potentially accelerate the process of de-dollarization,” they wrote, noting that November’s presidential election might be “fiercely divisive” and “contested.”

According to the bank, a recent survey of fixed-income money managers showed nearly half of respondents expect foreign central banks to decrease their reserve holdings of dollars and dollar-denominated assets over the next year.

Bitcoin price chart. (TradingView)

By Omkar Godbole

Bitcoin rose 3.2% on Monday to about $12,300, confirming an ascending triangle breakout on the daily chart.

The pattern resumes the uptrend from July lows under $9,000. The focus now is on resistance at $13,200 (July 2019 high) and $13,800 (June 2019 high).

“The market is looking at the 2019 high, and that’s the level to watch,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.

The on-chain data is supportive of continued gain in bitcoin. For instance, the balance of coins held on cryptocurrency exchanges sank to 21-month lows on Monday, indicating a strong holding sentiment in the investor community.

The bullish momentum looks strong as the cryptocurrency’s recent gains have been accompanied by increased miner supply. According to crypto data company ByteTree’s miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, miners have run down inventory by selling more than what they mined over the past five weeks. In other words, buyers have been able to absorb extra miner supply.

From a technical analysis perspective, the bullish bias would be invalidated if prices dropped back below $12,000 on Tuesday.

OMG (OMG) gets boost from blockchain backup: Rising congestion on the Ethereum blockchain is spurring interest in crypto projects that might speed traffic on the network. Prices for OMG, the token for the OMG network – a “layer-2” scaling solution for Ethereum transactions – rose by more than 70% over the past weekend, according to data source CoinGecko. It reached as high as $3.30 earlier on Monday and then quickly fell below $3. The OMG network uses a protocol called Plasma to scale up Ethereum transactions. Market participants are looking for OMG to “spreadhead layer-2 solutions,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital asset firm BeQuant.

Orchid Protocol (OXT) takes off even though it’s not a DeFi token: Prices for Orchid, the native token to a blockchain project that enables private internet browsing from Orchid Labs, hit an all-time high at $0.84 over the past weekend, up fivefold from a March low, according to CoinGecko. Barstool Sports’ David Portnoy, who claimed to have at least $1 million worth of bitcoin after meeting last week with the Winklevoss twins of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted earlier Monday that he has invested in OXT. “I’m now in on the shitcoin $oxt,” Portnoy wrote on Twitter, with a hashtag of “#pump.” The Orchid project previously raised $43 million for its token sale, as reported by CoinDesk. Its major investors included big names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchain Capital.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) facing delisting? The Malta-based OKEx said it may consider delisting Ethereum Classic from trading on its exchanges after it lost approximately $5.6 million of ETC from two recent 51% attacks. It won’t be an easy decision to make, Chief Executive Officer Jay Hao told CoinDesk, considering that OKEx has the highest trading volume of ETC among crypto exchanges. The impact of the two attacks on ETC’s prices, however, have not been significant: ETC’s price was still at around $7 on Monday, little changed from the week before the attacks first took place on Aug. 1.

Numerous factors could affect trade decisions, including regulatory and exchange news, stock market news, rumors, and opinions on social media such as on Twitter, Reddit, Youtube, and Telegram. There are also events that could affect the market, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), forks, airdrops, hacks, rebranding, and company future plans. Capital One asserted that “it would be impossible for human traders to track all of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency-related data and respond to that data in real time.” It would also be impossible to verify the credibility of the information in real time, the company added, noting:

Accordingly, there is a need for a centralized platform that analyzes speculation, news, and other cryptocurrency-related information as well as provides a recommendation and/or implements the provided recommendation.

The patent application describes a system with “a credibility analysis engine configured to determine the credibility of the cryptocurrency-related information,” with weighting assigned. It also describes an AI engine “configured to predict a cryptocurrency market trend based on … all received information and corresponding weighting.” In addition, it can be configured to generate and execute personalized trades automatically based on predicted crypto market trends.

The eight modules shown in the illustration — cryptocurrencies market, social media, event, cryptocurrencies company, user, regulation, fiat currency, and traditional data modules — may receive different types of crypto-related information, the filing notes.

Cryptocurrency-related information includes “speculation, rumors, opinions, and other information posted on social media,” the patent application details. For example, the information may be “an influencer’s opinions, recommendations, predictions, etc.” The system may evaluate the information and give corresponding weightings based on the popularity of the social medial post as well as the poster using data such as “views, likes, dislikes, comments, shares, retweets, and reposts.”

After analyzing, the system will “generate market predictions based on initial hypotheses and weights,” and can execute personalized trading decisions. The full patent which details the entire system can be found here.

Executive guide Ransomware: One of the biggest menaces on the web Everything you need to know about ransomware: how it started, why it's booming, how to protect against it, and what to do if your PC's infected. Read More

Law enforcement in Ukraine has announced today the arrest of a cybercrime gang who ran 20 cryptocurrency exchanges where they laundered more than $42 million in funds for criminal groups.

The group, which authorities said had three members, has been operating from Ukraine's Poltava region since 2018. According to Ukrainian officials, the group has advertised its services on underground criminal forums, where they offered to convert cryptocurrency from criminal activities into fiat (real-world) currency for other groups, helping criminals launder their ill-gotten profits.

The arrests took place in late June, earlier this year, but new details have been released Aug. 18 in joint press releases by Binance and Ukraine Cyber Police. Binance, who collaborated in the investigation, said the group collaborated with ransomware gangs, and also spread ransomware themselves.

The Bulletproof Exchanger Project

The Aug. 18 arrest also marks the first fruits of ""Bulletproof Exchanger,"" an internal Binance project that the company started earlier this year.

The project's goal is to identify hubs of malicious activity in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, track down the operators, and work with authorities to arrest and shut them down.

""'Bulletproof exchanger' is a general term used internally to refer to a high-risk exchanging service that serves as a cash-out point for criminal activity, such as ransomware,"" the Binance security team told ZDNet in an email last week.

""We kept running into exchangers like these in our day to day investigative work and historically rogue cashout points have played an important role in the underground criminal economy (i.e. BTC-E), which is why we decided to devote research efforts to study this problem,"" it said.

Acting on this decision, Binance said it began building a database of various signals and data sets earlier this year, such as user data, DNS records, open-source intelligence feeds, law enforcement requests, and blockchain analytics.

Help from TRM Labs

Once Binance had a full database at its disposal, the company partnered with TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm specialized in detecting fraud.

Binance said TRM Labs came in and combed through ""a massive amount of blockchain transaction data to analyze and correlate with suspicious activity on [Binance's] platform"" and eventually identify a first bulletproof exchanger and one of its clients, a ransomware gang.

""For this particular group, the strength of the signals which their accounts were eliciting gave us high confidence they were involved in nefarious activities and prompted the need for further investigation,"" the Binance security team said.

Leveraging a memorandum of understanding (MoU) the company signed with Ukrainian officials last year, Binance safely passed its findings to Ukrainian law enforcement, who began an investigation into the illegal exchanges and the group behind them earlier this year.

""Some cases can take years,"" the Binance security team told ZDNet. ""It was a perfect storm in this case, and we were able to move very fast, approximately three months from the time the case was opened to the time of takedown.""

Bulletproof Exchanger Project to continue

Binance says that its Bulletproof Exchanger Project will continue to operate going forward and that it hopes to track down similar criminal cash-out points and cybercrime groups in the near future.

""Fighting money laundering, ransomware, and other malicious activity is of critical importance to the well-being of the [cryptocurrency] community and industry growth,"" Binance said.",,https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/global-investment-bank-enters-crypto-currency-market-832954950.html,"NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Wall Street Organization, Inc., (WSO) www.wallstreetorganization.com, a recognized international banking investment banking company with nearly a quarter of a century of providing capital formation mechanisms to operating companies announced today, that it is throwing its financial hat into the ring, to establish a foothold on the rapidly accepted Bitcoin and Crypto Currency marketplace.

Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first of a new kind of asset called crypto currency, a decentralized form of digital cash that eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries like banks and governments to make financial transactions.

Instead, Bitcoin is powered through a combination of peer-to-peer technology — a network of individuals, much like the volunteer editors who create Wikipedia — and software-driven cryptography, the science of passing secret information that can only be read by the sender and receiver. This creates a currency backed by code rather than items of physical value, like gold or silver, or by trust in central authorities like the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen.

The Bitcoin represents an electronic payment mechanism based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

According to The Wall Street Organization's Dr. Farid Alshabbar, Ph.D., Director of Middle East Operations, (telephone 00973 34 34 34 41) or whattsapp stated, ""We've decided to call our crypto currency 'Wall Street Bitcoin' and feel that this investment has substantial merit and are looking forward to its acceptance in the exciting Bitcoin international marketplace.""

Unfortunately, Bitcoin couldn’t hold its price above the crucial $12,000 resistance and then support level.

The daily chart is still in an uptrend as anything above $363 is still considered a higher low, however, Ethereum’s momentum seems to be shifting in favor of the bears in the short-term.

The last high of XRP’s bull rally was established at $0.325. XRP then had a healthy consolidation period dipping below $0.27 but defending the daily 12-EMA. On August 17, XRP peaked above the first high and touched $0.327 but got rejected heavily dropping below $0.30 in the next two days.

All rights reserved.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-traders-discuss-whether-bitcoin-price-can-dip-below-10k-again,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 28% in the last 30 days and 36% at the weekly peak. Following the top cryptocurrency’s first breakout above $12,000 since September 2019, the sentiment remains optimistic. Many fundamental factors point toward an extended Bitcoin uptrend over the long run. Bitcoin has a favorable macro backdrop with the decline of the United States dollar and the rising demand for gold. The premier cryptocurrency has continuously rallied with the U.S. stock market and gold, demonstrating a consistent increase in appetite for BTC.

Bitcoin also has strong technical factors buoying the sentiment around the entire cryptocurrency market. The hashrate of the Bitcoin blockchain network is at an all-time high once again, which suggests a stable mining industry. The closure of BTC’s weekly candle above $11,900 indicates a strong uptrend following weeks of consolidation in June.

But on Aug. 19, the price of Bitcoin declined from $12,486 to $11,611, demonstrating steep rejection at a pivotal resistance area. Last August, the price of Bitcoin briefly went to the same resistance at around $12,300 before pulling back.

Due to the abrupt rejection of Bitcoin at $12,400, traders seemingly anticipate a stable consolidation phase over the next several weeks, cooling down the futures market, neutralizing the funding rates, and providing the market with a stronger foundation for a prolonged recovery.

The term “funding rate” refers to the mechanism used by Bitcoin futures exchanges to provide market balance. If the market is majority long, then long contract holders need to compensate short holders. When funding rates are too high, the price of BTC stagnates, since it’s less compelling to long the market.

Short-term Bitcoin trend

Based on various metrics and the pause of Bitcoin’s rally at a pivotal resistance level, crypto traders say that BTC is likely to stay in the current price range. Michael van de Poppe, trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph contributor, thinks BTC could stagnate throughout August and possibly into September, meaning that, altcoins could reap the benefits at least in the short-term: “The general scenario is that we’ll be ranging a bit here, before continuation of the downwards momentum. Overall -> alts [altcoins] (smaller ones) continue to do well.”

A minor pullback in the near-term would be a healthy reset for the price of Bitcoin, especially when funding rates are considered. Prior to the drop, the funding rate of Bitcoin futures contracts on BitMEX and Binance Futures were nearing 0.0864% and 0.1199%, respectively.

When funding rates are this high, it could leave Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies vulnerable to a potential long squeeze. As such, a stabilization period supplemented with a minor pullback and a drop in funding rates could benefit the longer-term trend of Bitcoin.

Considering numerous factors, including the positive reset of funding rates, derivatives trader Cantering Clark said that the BTC trend is overall positive, but uncertainty is beginning to build in the crypto market following BTC’s overnight drop. When the sentiment around Bitcoin turns cautious after weeks of rallying, it is generally optimistic. According to Clark:

“This is good, it’s already happening. The charts are coming out. Uncertainty is brewing. ‘Distribution,’ 7k calls, top, etc etc. Bring it to the brink, flip funding and then rip it up again.”

Similarly, Mohit Sorout, founding partner of Bitazu Capital, said the recent pullback would cool off the overheated derivatives market. The futures market overran the spot market in July, as BitMEX Research and CryptoCompare show. As the crowded futures market now begins to settle down, it could further strengthen the BTC uptrend. Mohit also said: “Cool off overheated derivs for a few days here then take us to the promised land.”

Long-term optimism

Over the long-term, researchers, especially on-chain analysts, are optimistic about the trend of Bitcoin due to an inflow of institutional capital into Bitcoin, more wallets holding onto BTC, and the amount of Bitcoin reserves on exchanges declining. The three data points indicate that fewer retail investors, for now, are willing to sell BTC at current prices, according to Glassnode: “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) broke in to the ‘Belief’ zone for the first time over a year. Its current value is lower than the last time $BTC hit $12,000 — suggesting potential for more price upside from here.”

While the momentum of Bitcoin remains generally strong due to institutions like Microstrategy acquiring more BTC and retail investors continuing to withdraw their Bitcoin from exchanges, whales or miners starting a BTC sell-off remains a persistent threat.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, whale clusters are found in the $12,000 to $14,000 macro resistance range, with $12,000 either marking a profit or break-even point. Whales typically don’t sell when they are below their break-even point, and instead wait for sufficient liquidity in the market. Similar trends were spotted in October 2019 and February 2020, when BTC abruptly dropped from $10,500.

Overall, as the OKEx on-chain data report shows, traders are beginning to treat the $10,000 level as a strong area of support. The exchange found that many traders closed their old positions from $6,200 to $9,700 and built up new positions at $10,000 onward. As BTC has remained above $10,000 for a prolonged period, the likelihood of a newfound rally would likely increase: “A lot of older positions (between $6,200 and $9,700) were recently (in the last seven weeks) closed for profit, reducing the downward pressure on BTC’s price.”

Talking to CNBC, Dave Chapman, BC Group’s executive director, said that the firm is seeing traditional finance investors joining the crypto space: “OSL is witnessing institutional investors and traditional finance scrambling to participate in the Bitcoin, Ethereum and wider digital asset space.”

The trend favors the alts?

One consistent theme throughout the rally of Bitcoin since early June has been the booming altcoin market. Led by the interest in decentralized finance, some altcoins have outperformed BTC in the past several weeks. Yearn Finance (YFI), Chainlink (LINK), Band Protocol (BAND) and Aave (LEND) all posted two-to-ten-fold gains.

Researchers at Santiment, an on-chain analysis firm, believe the so-called alt season “is about to be finished.” If it does, there are two scenarios: profits flow into stablecoin and the market corrects, or profits flow into Bitcoin:

“Alts will enjoy the party, one by one, crazy money will move from one to another, there are still some alts to pump (though their number is getting less and less). [...] After process is over either we all together go down, or Bitcoin will go up alone.”

In the medium- to long-term, on-chain analysis and the trend of altcoins suggest that the $10,000 support level of Bitcoin could hold.

The five individuals — Pablo Renato Rodriguez, Gutemberg Dos Santos, Scott Hughes, Cecilia Millan, and Jackie Aguilar — ran a company called AirBit Club since the beginning of 2015, which claimed to mine and trade in cryptocurrency, the Justice Department said in a statement.

The alleged fraudsters, charged with running a multimillion-dollar fraud and money-laundering ring, spent their victims’ money on luxury cars, jewelry, and homes, according to Homeland Security Investigations special agent-in-charge Peter Fitzhugh.

Prosecutors say that they traveled throughout the world and hosted expositions and presentations — inducing victims to purchase memberships in AirBit Club’s scheme.

The victims are reported to have observed profits accumulate on the website of the scheme, but no actual bitcoin mining or trading took place. Instead, the alleged fraudsters enriched themselves with the invested funds.

The Justice Department claims the defendants laundered at least $20 million of the proceeds in the scheme.

Rodriguez, Dos Santos, and Millan stand charged with single count to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.

Hughes was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Aguilar was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

Bitcoin traded nearly 3.9% lower at $11,787.89 on Wednesday at press time.

Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency that is intended to act as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency has become popular in the last decade, in particular, with Bitcoin becoming the most widely tracked alternative currency. Typically, cryptocurrency is electronic-only and does not have a physical form – that graphic at the top of the page is just an artist’s vision of digital currency.

Cryptocurrency appeals to many people because of its ability to be managed without a central bank and therefore concerns around secrecy and subterfuge. It appeals because of its ability to hold value and not be inflated away by central banks that want to print money. It’s also very difficult to counterfeit due to the blockchain ledger system that manages the currency.

Here’s what cryptocurrency is, how it works and the significant drawbacks to its use.

How cryptocurrency works

Cryptocurrencies are produced, tracked and managed through what’s called a distributed ledger such as blockchain. In a distributed ledger, the currency’s movement is processed by computers in a decentralized network, to ensure the integrity of the financial data and ownership of the cryptocurrency. Think of it like a giant never-ending receipt of all the system’s transactions that is being constantly verified by everyone who can see the receipt.

This decentralized system is typical of many cryptocurrencies, which eschew a central authority. That’s part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin – it keeps governments and central banks out of the currency system, reducing their interference and political maneuvering.

To this end, in some cryptocurrencies, the number of units of currency is limited. In the case of Bitcoin, the system is organized so that no more than 21 million bitcoins can be issued.

But how exactly does cryptocurrency come to exist? The key way is through what’s called mining, to use a metaphor related to the old monetary system based on gold or silver. Powerful computers, often known as miners, perform calculations and process transactions on the ledger. By doing so, they earn a unit of the currency, or at least a part of a unit. It requires a lot of expensive processing power and often a lot of electricity to perform these calculations.

Owners of the currency may store it in a cryptocurrency wallet, a computer app that allows them to spend or receive the currency. To make a transaction, users need a “key,” which allows them to write in the public ledger, noting the transfer of the money. This key may be tied to a specific person, but that person’s name is not immediately tied to the transaction.

So part of the appeal of cryptocurrency for many is that it can be used somewhat anonymously.

There’s literally no limit to the number of cryptocurrencies that could be created. The range of them is astonishing, and literally thousands of currencies popped up in the last few years, especially as Bitcoin soared into mainstream popularity in 2017. Some of the most popular cryptos include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Tether. Even Facebook has been trying to get in on the cryptocurrency game by establishing a consortium of industry partners.

The drawbacks of cryptocurrency

While proponents have a good story to tell about digital currencies such as Bitcoin, these currencies are not without serious drawbacks, at least as currently configured. That doesn’t mean you can’t make money on it by selling it to someone else at a higher price than you paid. However, these drawbacks do make it virtually useless as a currency, a means of exchange.

Bitcoin and other cryptos have real detractors, including some of the world’s top investors, such as multi-billionaire Warren Buffett. Buffett has called Bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” while his longtime business partner Charlie Munger has said cryptocurrency trading is “just dementia.”

Mining the currency is expensive and polluting

One of the most significant negatives to cryptocurrency is that it is “mined” by computers. Mining isn’t free, of course, and requires substantial amounts of energy to create a coin. While miners consume and pay for energy to run their rigs, it also creates significant pollution and waste.

One 2019 study in technology journal Joule concluded that Bitcoin mining produced enough carbon emissions in 2018 to rank it between the countries of Jordan and Sri Lanka. Researchers from MIT and the Technical University of Munich concluded that Bitcoin mining alone accounted for 0.2 percent of global electricity consumption. Add in the effects from other cryptos and electricity usage more than doubled.

The number of coins is fixed

Proponents of Bitcoin tout the currency’s fixed number of coins as a positive, saying that it will ensure that the currency cannot be devalued, for example, by central banks. However, by limiting the total amount of currency, cryptocurrency would act like a gold standard, exposing an economy to potentially destructive deflationary spirals, if implemented on a widespread basis.

When money flows freely in an economy during a boom, no problems may arise. But when times get tough, consumers and businesses often hoard money, to provide them a buffer against instability and job loss. By hoarding, they slow the movement of money through the economy, potentially leading to a destructive deflationary spiral. At its worst form, consumers end up not spending, because goods will be cheaper tomorrow, plunging the economy into crisis.

This problem is exactly why modern countries have moved away from the gold standard and to fiat currency. Free from the gold standard, central banks can increase money flowing through the economy in tough times, even if consumers and businesses hoard it, preventing the economy from seizing up.

A volatile currency is unusable

The limited number of coins, speculative mania and a good story have combined to make the price of Bitcoin volatile. That may be fine if you’re looking to trade it, but it makes Bitcoin useless as a currency. Currency is valuable only if consumers can rely on it to retain purchasing power.

Imagine going to a restaurant where your meal costs $10 one day but $20 the next. You might be tempted to spend only on the days when your meal is cheap, but economies as a whole can’t function like that. Instead, they need a medium of exchange that is stable, so participants can trade one thing for another and can understand the value of what they’re trading.

So to the extent that Bitcoin is great for traders — that is, it’s volatile — it’s terrible as a currency.

Other drawbacks

Cryptocurrencies have other drawbacks as well, including the lack of security in digital wallets for holding currencies, its use in crimes, and its slowness in processing transactions, compared to near-instantaneous processing from traditional networks such as Visa and Mastercard.

In addition, because the IRS has labeled Bitcoin an asset and not a currency, every transaction with Bitcoin has the potential to create a taxable capital gain, meaning you must report it on your tax return. If you spend bitcoins at a price higher than you purchased them, you’ll owe tax.

Bottom line

While cryptocurrency certainly has some potential benefits, it also has serious drawbacks that so far make it unusable as a currency. Investors are probably best advised to take Buffett’s advice and stay away from the cryptocurrency market. But if you have to test it out to see what it’s all about, keep your position size small and don’t put in more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin traded slightly higher early Thursday at $11,772 after falling for two straight days.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has declined 1.3% this week as the U.S. dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets. The greenback gained support Wednesday as the Federal Reserve said it wasn’t immediately planning to implement a “yield curve control” program that probably would have brought an accelerated pace of money printing.

Bitcoin’s mini sell-off this week has revealed a key feature of fast-evolving cryptocurrency markets: How dollar-linked “stablecoins” are being used to fund exotic futures trades, similar to the way money markets serve as a vital lifeblood on Wall Street.

As flagged earlier this week by the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research, prices for bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago-based CME exchange have been trading well above “spot” prices for the underlying security. That premium rose last week to 20%, the highest in five months, seen as a sign of just how bullish big investors have become on bitcoin.

This week’s retreat in prices below $12,000 has led to a squeeze for traders who were attempting a “cash and carry arbitrage,” as reported Wednesday by CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. It’s a strategy in which traders buy bitcoin and then short futures contracts on the cryptocurrency, betting the prices will eventually converge and the premium will be pocketed as a profit.

The annualized premium dropped to 14% in under 48 hours as prices slid, and some traders rushed to unwind their arbitrage trades.

One lesson from the episode is that traders were apparently using stablecoins such as tether (USDT) to fund the trade, according to Godbole.

“Stablecoins are widely used as funding currencies, and there has been a high demand for these dollar-backed cryptocurrencies from institutions,” Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told Godbole in a Telegram chat.

Bitcoin’s recent price pullback may worsen as the U.S. dollar shows signs of life on the back of minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s meeting in July.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against that of other reserve currencies, has jumped 1% to 93 in the past 24 hours, the biggest single-day rise in two months.

USD has picked up on the news the Fed is not planning on implementing controversial yield curve controls on bonds – something markets had been anticipating.

The correlation between bitcoin and the dollar is historically weak. But in the past month there has been a growing inverse relationship between the two as more investors look for alternatives to the U.S. currency. Analysts with Goldman Sachs and some investors have warned the greenback's reserve-currency status might be at risk.

CoinDesk pricing data shows bitcoin rising from $9,000 to $12,400 in the four weeks through Aug. 17, just as the dollar index declined to 92 from 97.

But in the face of a strengthening dollar, bitcoin has fallen to around $11,780, down 5% from a 2020 high reached earlier this week.

Continued recovery in the dollar could yield further losses for bitcoin, but a sustained rebound in the U.S. currency still looks unlikely. Interest rates likely to remain close to zero to stimulate the economy, and inflation-adjusted yields are trading at negative levels; analysts at Deutsche Bank and elsewhere say the Fed might be forced to undertake more radical monetary measures.

Token Watch

Ren (REN) is benefiting from rising demand for tokenized bitcoin in DeFi: Prices for the Ren token have doubled in the past few days. Like other protcols designed to produce synthetic version of cryptocurrencies, RenVM takes bitcoins and produces an ERC-20 token called renBTC that can be used in Ethereum-based applications. More than 10,000 of the tokenized bitcoin, renBTC, were locked on Monday, according to DeFi Pulse. RenBTC currently represents about 21.7% of the tokenized bitcoin market, ranking it second behind wrapped bitcoin (WBTC).

Rates to borrow the Synthetix stablecoin sUSD monetarily spiked to almost 50% Wednesday on Aave’s decentralized lending platform. The cause? According to Stani Kulechov, chief executive of Aave, users were clamoring for the dollar-linked sUSD tokens to send to Curve, so they could participate win that protocol’s CRV tokens via “yield farming.” Prices for CRV were trading at $4.35 at the time of writing, up 14.8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. As Arcane Research put it earlier this week, it’s a “summer of crazy returns” in ” exuberant DeFi.”

Aave (LEND) is seeing a surge in transactions to go with its 2020 price jump: “Despite growing criticism about the actual value locked being significantly smaller than reported in DeFi Pulse, on-chain activity for these protocols and their tokens demonstrate thriving activity,” according to a post Wednesday by the crypto-intelligence firm IntoTheBlock on CoinMarketCap.com’s blog . The decentralized lender’s token is up 29-fold this year, for a market valuation of $700 million, inspiring incredulity. The bull case is that “there is no denying that these innovations have the potential to redefine finance as we know it,” IntoTheBlock wrote. CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reported last week that Aave plans to work the firm RealT to tokenize home mortgages.

Russia’s primary crypto opponent is Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the State Duma and a key architect of Russia’s crypto ban. In mid-August, Aksakov argued that legalizing crypto payments basically “means the destruction of a financial system.”

Speaking to Cointelegraph, major global crypto figures like BitGo CEO Mike Belshe and Binance’s head of operations in Russia and CIS, Gleb Kostarev, concurred that payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) pose no threat to Russia’s economy.

But we spoke to Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations for Russia and the CIS. Kostarev outlined that crypto payments are already adopted in countries like the Netherlands and Venezuela, and people all around the world already pay for goods and services in cryptocurrency.

“These working solutions are the result of the successful integration of traditional financial services and cryptocurrency projects. And here it should be noted that cryptocurrencies can hardly destroy the financial system, but without any doubt they can complement it.”

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe echoes the sentiment. He said that Russia’s financial crisis of 2014 has significantly impacted the strength of the ruble over the past five years. This negative impact “had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.”

Belshe suggested that Russia could be following a pattern established by countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Argentina, which see any alternative currency as a threat to their own weak currencies. But he argues that taking this action for this reason is misguided:

“This never works, because the governments are unable to stabilize their own currencies, and the citizens need stability to survive — potentially forcing them to use alternate currencies or black markets. If Russia was truly looking out for their people, they would be embracing cryptocurrencies rather than banning it.”

Waves founder and CEO Alexander Ivanov is confident that crypto has no chance to harm any financial system. He compared Bitcoin payments to transactions that involve a foreign currency. “Crypto payments are unable to destroy any economy, just as credit card payments in foreign currencies don’t ruin it,” he said.

George Payne is the co-founder of crypto payment app GatePay. He is also certain that cryptocurrencies could certainly be used to bolster economic growth after countries establish “well-thought-out and executed policy.” He also questioned the feasibility of the ban on crypto payments, as there are ways to pay in crypto and stay anonymous. Payne said:",,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/08/17181642/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-american-wrap-920,"Bitcoin price appears to be settling around $11,700 after a minor recovery from Thursday’s slump to levels around $11,500. The reversal back to $12,000 is proving to be an uphill task probably because most analysts predict doom before dawn for the largest crypto by market capitalization.

Buyers managed to push Ethereum’s price above $400 again and the daily 12-EMA, currently at 410. The last low of the daily uptrend is still at $365, which means that anything above this level is considered a higher low. For now, the risk of Ethereum shifting into a downtrend is minimal.

The U.S. state of Hawaii has authorized 12 cryptocurrency companies to start operating in the state without needing a money transmission license. No action will be taken against them for conducting unlicensed money transmission activities for two years.

Hawaii Green-Lights 12 Crypto Firms

Several cryptocurrency companies independently announced on Wednesday that they have been greenlighted to launch in the U.S. state of Hawaii. They have been admitted to the state’s Digital Currency Innovation Lab (DCIL), a program that “allows digital currency issuers to do business in Hawaii without obtaining a state money transmitter license,” the program’s website reads. This regulatory sandbox is in partnership with the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions (DFI).

The program, which runs from Aug. 19 to Dec. 31, 2022, accepted applications from cryptocurrency companies between March 17 and May 1. A total of 19 companies applied; 12 companies, including several crypto exchanges, fulfilled the conditions of the program and have been admitted. The website details:

The participating company will be given 2 years to engage in digital currency transactions. DFI has issued a ‘no action message’ – stating that ‘no action’ will be taken against companies conducting what DFI would consider unlicensed money transmission activity, if they have been successfully admitted into the program.

The 12 companies admitted to the program are Apex Crypto, Bitflyer USA, Blockfi, Cex.io, Cloud Nalu, Coinme, Erisx, Flexa, Gemini Exchange, Novi Financial, River Financial, and Robinhood Crypto.

The DFI will monitor all cryptocurrency transactions taking place in the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. Participants will be required to provide updates, including the number and value of transactions. They are also required to provide information regarding the number of complaints received and any regulatory enforcement orders.

Participants that do not receive explicit approval to continue operations must conclude all cryptocurrency transactions when the two-year period is up. “Per the participation agreement, companies must also execute on the wind-down plan and exit strategy. DFI will determine the appropriate licensing for the company to continue operations, if applicable,” the website clarifies.

Hawaii previously had strict rules for crypto businesses, prompting a number of companies to exit the state. Coinbase, for example, ceased operations in Hawaii in early 2018 over requirements to hold fiat reserves.

Despite debuting in 2009, the currency became well-known in 2017, when one Bitcoin was worth $19,873. However, there are other exciting crypto trading options on the market, some of which are outpacing Bitcoin. So why has Bitcoin dominated the market?

Besart Hoxha is a well-known cryptocurrency trader, and he has made millions of dollars from trading his assets. He is a 27-year-old entrepreneur who discovered crypto in 2011 at the age of 18, and he has been hooked ever since. “Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency because it’s gotten the most press,” he says. “Even your mom probably knows about it. Bitcoin has all of the perks of crypto, including bypassing fees, remaining anonymous, and enjoying fast transaction speeds.”

According to Besart, Bitcoin can be a great introduction to the crypto market for both beginners and young people who are just starting to invest. “There’s a lot of information on the internet about Bitcoin. It’s easy to research and figure out whether it’s the right investment for you. Different cryptocurrencies can be trickier.”

Despite the popularity of Bitcoin, Hoxha has branched out to other cryptocurrencies. “When I started investing, Bitcoin seemed daunting,” he says. “So, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and decided to take some time and learn more.”

His first big investment was in Ethereum in 2015. It’s an alternative cryptocurrency that was about to hit the market. “I took a loan out at the bank and invested everything I had,” he says. “I knew it would be lucrative, and I had faith in myself that my predictions were correct.” His investment paid off in 2017 when he turned in his Ethereum for millions of dollars.

Overall, he suggests branching out from Bitcoin. “I think Bitcoin has had its day in the sun,” Hoxha says. “There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there that you can invest in and have lots of luck with. Even though Bitcoin is still the most popular, it doesn’t mean you have to limit yourself.”

Cryptocurrency is a growing market, and Bitcoin doesn’t show any signs of going away. Hoxha urges anyone interested in this world to do their research and start making investments over time. It’s possible to make lots of money with crypto if you’re willing to put in the hard work.",2020-08-20 10:45:28-07:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165512-canada-based-middle-eastern-restaurant-converts-entire-cash-reserves-to-bitcoin-btc-following-covid-19-outbreak-and-resulting-challenges/,"Ontario, Canada’s Tahinis Restaurants, which claims to be the world’s best Middle Eastern restaurant, revealed that it has converted its entire cash reserves into Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency.

The company explained that it experienced significant challenges during the historic market crash in March 2020, following the COVID-19 outbreak. They noted that it was quite tough on them and people, in general, had been scared to go out to eat.

The restaurant owners revealed that they were forced to part ways with their partners and employees. They also claim that they were working around the clock to maintain their operations.

They noted that they were able to keep their business going, with a lot of hard work and dedication, however, they were faced with “one big problem.”

The Tahinis Restaurants team revealed:

“The government assistance programs in Canada made it very hard for us to bring back our partners (employees) as they were making more money staying at home and not working. All of a sudden we went from an economic crisis to everyone having a lot of money Including us.”

They added:

“Our Cash reserves swelled and business was booming again. But it was apparent to us that cash didn’t have the same appeal. That eventually with all the excess cash circulating the economy that cash would be worth less.”

The restaurant owner claims he’s been an active investor and that he discovered Bitcoin (BTC) and thought about investing in the digital asset on several occasions. However, he never gave it much attention because of people like billionaire Warren Buffett who had referred to cryptocurrencies as “rat poison” and has said that he’s certain they will have a bad ending.

But with the passage of time, he realized that Bitcoin would make a worthwhile investment, because he had been reading and researching about how it works.

He notes:

“I view Bitcoin as a true free savings technology that stores wealth across time and space. And it [became] apparent to me that there is a game of musical chairs being played right now and the music will stop and some people will get left out…as a company, [we] decided to store all of our excess cash reserves into Bitcoin as it offers a much better alternative to saving cash. We will continue to do that over the coming years and maybe forever if we don’t have a need for the fiat.”

It seems like more people are becoming aware of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, according to a recent survey from US based Bitcoin ATM provider, CoinFlip – which reveals that one in five Americans or 20% of them have purchased digital currencies.

More than 1,000 Americans were asked various questions about cryptos.

An increasing number of consumers said they now prefer to use crypto to pay for goods and services. About 14.5% of US residents, responding to the survey, said they knew or were aware of three or more cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin

Around 44% said they bought cryptos from an exchange, meanwhile, Bitcoin ATMs or in-person transactions were the “second-most-popular” options at about 28%, the survey revealed.

The CEO at crypto firm BitGo recently recommended allocating 3% of portfolios to Bitcoin, after a Nasdaq listed firm acquired $250 Million in BTC as its “primary reserve asset.”

While Bitcoin might be emerging as a legitimate or widely-used asset, it’s worth noting that cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile and there are many scams being carried out in this space. Historical data confirms that diversifying one’s assets instead of completely allocating to one type of asset is almost always a better idea. In other words, don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-court-orders-seizure-of-46000-bitcoin-linked-to-coincheck-hack-of-2018/,"Japanese Court Orders Seizure of Cryptocurrency Linked to Coincheck Hack of 2018

A court in Tokyo, Japan has ordered the seizure of crypto assets that have been traced back to the Coincheck hack of January 2018, The Japan Times reported Wednesday.

More than $530 million worth of the NEM (XEM) cryptocurrency was stolen from the exchange two years ago in what turned out to be the crypto industry’s biggest heist.

While the Times did not provide figures, another report in a different local publication reveals that about 4.8 million yen ($45,000) in bitcoin (BTC) and XEM is to be confiscated from Takayoshi Doi.

The 30-year-old doctor from Obihiro, Hokkaido, was arrested in March, together with an accomplice, for buying stolen XEM and for violating a law against participating in organized crime. But police do not believe Doi was responsible for the hack.

According to the reports, the Tokyo District Court placed a protective order on Doi’s digital assets ahead of a police-authorized confiscation of the money. Prosecutors say the tokens were deposited on a domestic cryptocurrency exchange.

Should the suspect be found guilty, the XEM will be seized and forfeited to the government, possibly for auction and compensation to the Coincheck victims.

The court order is believed to be the first such order issued for crypto assets in the Asian country, The Japan Times said.

Hackers plundered 523 million XEM tokens from Coincheck on January 26, 2018. At the time, the coins’ estimated value totaled $530 million but have declined sharply ever since. Today, the stolen tokens are worth just $38 million.

Coincheck’s theft remains the biggest in the cryptocurrency industry, dwarfing Mt Gox’s $460 million hack of 2014.

European stocks were up and the euro was down early Friday as investors continued to bet on technology shares and a vaccine breakthrough while shrugging off fresh signs that the economic recovery is faltering. The dollar was headed for its first weekly gain since mid-June.

“It does almost seem as if the entire crypto market is taking its cues from the U.S. dollar,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email.

Market moves

Even after growing 100-fold in the past five years, the entirety of the cryptocurrency asset class, which has a total market valuation of $372 billion, is just fraction of the $35 trillion U.S. stock market.

What’s surprising is that still-fledgling digital-asset markets might be more rational and functional these days than Wall Street: The various ups and downs of token prices are sending out bona fide market signals that point to projects and opportunities where capital is warranted, and investors are responding.

Mainstream investment analysts and Wall Street Journal columnists now assert matter-of-factly that the stock market is merely propped up by this year’s $3 trillion of money-printing by the Federal Reserve.

Sure, bitcoin has benefited from the perception that the largest cryptocurrency might benefit from inflation, since many investors see it as a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold.

Far more fascinating are the capital flows into the semi-autonomous lending and trading systems being built atop the Ethereum and other blockchains under the rubric of “decentralized finance,” or DeFi.

A real market?

Soaring token prices for projects like Aave, Chainlink, Compound and Curve, not to mention good-luck-explaining-this-to-your-friends outliers like Yam and Spaghetti, have indeed attracted capital, at least for stretches. According to DeFi pulse, total value socked away into the platforms has jumped 10-fold this year to $7 billion.

It might all just be speculative hype, but that might actually be preferable to global foreign exchange markets that are heavily influenced if not controlled by central bank officials.

Within the digital-asset ecosystem, investors have figured out how to quickly allocate and reallocate capital whenever new opportunities arise.

CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey reported on Thursday that juicy returns in the DeFi market are making some investors shift away, at least temporarily, from putting their money into options contracts on bitcoin.

“Every derivatives trader that was looking for incremental yield and levered returns has been besotted by the magnitude of moves in DeFi,” Viashl Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told Cawrey. “So, naturally, cost of capital dictates at least some attention that way.”

Open interest in bitcoin options has dipped recently. Source: Skew

Traders are even are putting their bitcoins into DeFi platforms to take advantage of the higher yields in the fast-growing arena.

Since the start of the year, the number of bitcoin locked in DeFi has grown 34-fold to about 49,000.

It might be a bubble, but at least it’s not a game of trying to anticipate the Fed’s next move. In fact there’s even room for investors to take bets on which projects might become dominant players in the future, without struggling so much to understand what exactly is happening, as often seems to be the case these days in so many traditional markets.

“DeFi long term will revolutionize finance, but this short-term bubble is bound to pop eventually, in my opinion,” Michael Gord, co-founder of trading firm Global Digital Assets, told Cawrey. At that point, the locked-up bitcoins might flow back out of DeFi, and more money might flow back into bitcoin options.

Almost like a real market.

Bitcoin put-call skew. Source: Skew

Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% from the 13-month high above $12,400 reached on Monday.

Unless buying action comes quick, downwards momentum could push prices down to $11,000, the cryptocurrency trading firm QCP noted earlier this week.

Open interest in bitcoin options has risen back to near record high levels seen in July.

However, that is not necessarily a bullish development, as investors have recently sold call options. That is evident from the recent recovery in the one-month put-call skew from -10% to -3%.

Investors typically sell call options when they expect prices to consolidate or drop.

Dai (DAI): Stablecoin gets on Binance’s new DeFi staking platform. Dai, the dollar-linked stablecoin for crypto lending platform MakerDAO, has become the first available digital asset on Binance’s DeFi staking program. The Binance initiative aims to tap into this year’s booming DeFi market by offering users the ability to earn “staking rewards,” similar to interest on a bank deposit. Dai will be used to participate in Compound staking, according to Binance. Compound, another DeFi money market protocol, has more than $993 million worth of dai supply right now, according to its website. As CoinDesk previously reported, users of Compound were rushing to deposit their dai on the platform to maximize yields.

Tether (USDT): 1 billion of the dollar-linked stablecoins are shifted to the Ethereum blockchain from Tron.

TWEET OF THE DAY

What's hot",2020-08-21 13:02:38+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165543-okex-claims-that-bitcoin-btc-dominated-cryptocurrency-market-rally-is-being-driven-by-ethereum-2-0-defi/,"Crypto exchangenotes that the recent surge in the digital asset market, which is being led by Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, has been driven by the explosive growth of the decentralized finance or DeFI ecosystem.

The OKEx team confirms that Ethereum (ETH) experienced significant growth this past month. As reported, Ethereum is the biggest gainer out of all crypto-assets including Bitcoin (BTC). OKEx notes that the ETH spot price surpassed the $400 mark on August 1, 2020.

The leading crypto exchange adds:

“After trading sideways, the price of ETH on OKEx was roughly 10% higher by the middle of the month. On OKEx, the top two ETH trading pairs — i.e., ETH/BTC and ETH/USDT — have increased their trading volume to over $160 million.”

OKEx CEO Jay Hao thinks that the upcoming and highly-anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade might be a major factor in the dramatic surge in the Ethereum price.

Hao points out that Ethereum’s main challenge is its inability to scale to handle a large number of transactions. Other blockchain networks like EOS and Telos are able to handle significantly more transactions, however, they don’t have nearly as large of a developer community or ecosystem participants. That’s why Ethereum should remain the dominant platform for developing DeFi apps or any other type of distributed application, according to most objective crypto industry analysts.

Hao states:

“[A] positive market sentiment has increased in the lead up to Ethereum 2.0. The upgrade will allow Ethereum to implement sharding and scale, which will subsequently promote the growth of decentralized applications as well as the DeFi space.”

The Eth 2.0 system-wide upgrade will involve a transition from the platform’s proof of work based consensus to a proof of stake consensus mechanism. This type of update has never been attempted on a blockchain network as large as Ethereum.

Even though it could take several years before the transition to proof of stake is finally completed (if it is), Hao claims:

“Holders of ETH on OKEx will be in a prime position to stake ETH, which will not only help maintain the network, vastly reduce energy output and help to preserve the environment, but will also earn them real ETH rewards.”

OKEx is notably the operator of the fifth-largest mining pool in the blockchain industry. The exchange has been working cooperatively with Prysmatic Labs and has reportedly committed to the growth of the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem by serving a (transaction) validator on Ethereum’s Topaz testnet (for Eth 2.0).

Hao further notes:

“By managing to scale with partnerships and integration, decentralized oracles such as Chainlink and OKEx Oracle, which works with Compound’s open price feed, have provided data for (decentralized applications) dApps to handle more users and increase their consumer viability.”

The price of Chainlink’s LINK token has surged more than 1,000% this year. In August 2020, LINK went from only $6 to over $16 in mid-August 2020. OKEx reports that on its exchange, the LINK/USDT trading pair had a 24-hour volume of about $25 million.

Chainlink has become increasingly popular because it aims to provide decentralized price oracles and a secure way for blockchain based smart contracts to communicate or interact with external data sources. The security of distributed ledger tech (DLT) networks remains a key priority, because they’ve been exploited numerous times (due to poorly written code). The hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts are often able to steal large amounts of funds.

Despite these issues, OKEx confirms:

“Much of the DeFi market sentiment is similarly bullish, as the price of Aave (LEND), another major token, has increased from $0.30 to $0.50 from early to mid-August, which is also a gain of over 165%.”

Just like other major exchanges such as Binance and Huobi, OKEx is aggressively listing DeFi tokens.

They OKEx team notes:

“In addition to already listing the major DeFi tokens LINK, Maker (MKR) and Compound (COMP), OKEx has listed Aave (LEND), Curve (CRV), Aragon (ANT), Serum (SRM), Decentralised Information Asset (DIA) and Kleros (PNK) in August alone. With 19 DeFi tokens in total, the growth of its decentralized public chain, OKChain, and its own secure price feed in OKEx Oracle, OKEx is strengthening its commitment to the ongoing development of the DeFi space.”

It’s worth noting that many of these so-called decentralized platforms are really just centralized solutions. This becomes evident when there’s a hack, and a project’s team members have to step in to pause the network, in order to “fix things.”",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-eth-options,"Bitcoin traders are hitting the sell button Friday while the ether options market loads up on lower prices.

Over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg expects a bullish, if not record, fourth quarter ahead for bitcoin, even if the number of sluggish market days pile up. “I expect a slower curve but would not be surprised if we reach a $15,000 BTC in October and somewhere around $18,000-$20,000 at year end.”

Kugelberg points to the uncertain economy as giving people reason to swap fiat for crypto investments. “There’s the falling value of the dollar to be priced in; we have not seen the end of the dollar’s fall that is for sure,” he added. Indeed, while the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength versus a basket of other fiat currencies, is up 0.52% Friday, it’s still at lows not seen since June 2018.

Precious metals are in focus as BTC and gold (@gc) show correlation.

Market Trends This Week

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies, continued their bullish trends this week. After an initial failed breakout attempt, Bitcoin finally emerged out of a twelve-week consolidation the week of July 31st. The trend has been steady since the breakout around $10,000, though Bitcoin stalled this week after briefly surpassing the $12,000 level. $12,000 is a major level to watch for Bitcoin because it is the level where the bull market from 2019 ultimately fizzled out. Previous price action levels can often be hurdles in the short term for prices as they represent old supply and can mean investors who bought at that time and held are looking to cash out at break even.

While Bitcoin has shown firm price action, the undeniable leader has been Ethereum. Ethereum broke out earlier, has run further, and has already taken out previous resistance. BTC has run from $10,000 to $12,000 since breaking out while ETH has launched from $255 to just above the psychologically important $400 level.

Chinese citizens moved $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency out of the country in the past 12 months amid plummeting US-China relations, a report said.

A report by blockchain firm Chainalysis said this means Chinese people likely breached capital limits, as the government only allows citizens to buy a maximum of $50,000 in foreign currency.

The report said stablecoin Tether was mainly used to move the money out of the country.

Chinese citizens moved $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency out of the country and breached capital flight limits as relations between US and China hit new lows, a report says.

A report published Thursday by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis said that Chinese citizens have been breaching capital rules, as the government only allows citizens to move roughly $50,000 or less out of the country each year.

Chainalysis added historically wealthy citizens have gotten around this through foreign investments in real estate and other assets - sometimes even disguising investments through shell companies.

""Cryptocurrency could be picking up some of the slack though,"" Chainalysis said.

""Over the last twelve months, with China's economy suffering due to trade wars and devaluation of the yuan at different points, we've seen over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from China-based addresses to overseas addresses,"" Chainalysis said.

Chinese citizens are using stablecoin Tether to move money

The report noted that controversial stablecoin Tether is primarily being used to move money out of the country.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to reduce volatility. It can be pegged to a cryptocurrency, exchange-traded commodities or fiat money.

Tether which is believed to be pegged to the US dollar has surged in popularity among traders in recent years.

Much of the popularity stems from the Chinese government's crackdown on direct exchanges of yuan for cryptocurrency, causing Tether to become the ""de facto"" fiat model used for Chinese cryptocurrency users, Chainalysis said.

""In total, over $18 billion worth of Tether has moved from East Asia addresses to those based in other regions over the last 12 months. Again, it's highly unlikely that all of this is capital flight,"" the blockchain firm said.

Chainalysis said the spike in Tether movements may have been prompted by a a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping he gave on October 25 signalling the country may launch its own cryptocurrency. That may have contributed to perceptions that there may be limited opportunities for private ownership, sparking a capital flight, Chainalysis said.

The second spike happened around March 17, close to the time when the majority of Western economies were locking down amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""Equities in both the US and China were still losing value at this time, as was the yuan itself,"" Chainalysis said.

Tensions between the US and China have rapidly escalated in recent months. Both countries have clashed on Hong Kong legislation and who is to blame for the COVID-19 outbreak.

The row deepened in July when the US ordering the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China subsequently ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu late last month.

These days I spend most of my time tweaking the code of a bitcoin wallet that runs in Terminal. Based on Libbitcoin, it’s built to work over Nym Technologies’ anonymizing mixnet. I call it the Dark Renaissance wallet.

It’s mostly a learning exercise to hone my C++ skills, but the Dark Renaissance wallet is a harbinger for what is to come.

Working with a small, focused and ideological team, my comrades at PolyTech are upending some of the key assumptions on which the crypto industry has been built, and are plotting an all-out privacy offensive.

Our mission – the Dark Renaissance – is strategic and philosophical. At a personal level, it relates to a lifelong obsession with the philosophy of technology, and an intense awareness of the power of software.

It represents a desire to reconnect with bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist roots and fend off the forces of surveillance that creep into every aspect of our lives in 2020.

But first, it requires an understanding of the distant past.

Code as magic

Like the ancient Irish poets, the filí, programmers have the ability to alter reality with an utterance. Code is an incantation, an act of summoning ideas and inclinations into material reality. It is a conduit between the sphere of ideation and that of politics and sociality.

But technology isn’t merely the product of ideas – it actively shapes belief systems, reconfiguring the world in which it is applied.

Programmers know this: When a user’s behavior is influenced by code, it’s called opinionated software. When a user is manipulated for corporate interests, it is known as a dark pattern.

Encryption as art Source: Rachel-Rose O'Leary

Software also has unintended consequences. Released into the wild, code propagates ideology in unpredictable and chaotic ways. Inevitably, it backfires, and innovation flows through human society, irrespective of, and indifferent to, political difference.

To what extent technology is informed by and produces belief systems has haunted me throughout my adult life.

It has caused me nightmares: dark conclusions on the nature of technology, prophecies of machine takeover and terrifying visions of the future of war.

It has also given me dreams. I believe it is within humanity’s power to reshape the narrative by which technology is formed. In doing so, it becomes possible to take back the reins of runaway technological innovation and re-orientate human destiny.

Crypto is at the front line of this struggle.

Crypto philosophy

I came to crypto through encryption. I saw hash functions as a kind of abstract poetry that spoke of the secrecy of nature and the unknown.

Crypto was immersed in a romantic glow. In Ethereum’s early days, I believed I was witnessing the emergence of Skynet. It was the promise of Turing Complete, general computation and if artificial intelligence was going to emerge anywhere, it would be there, I believed at the time.

It was my doomer phase, and Ethereum was a source of dark fascination. Inspired by the Ethereum yellow paper, I wrote my master’s thesis in 2016 on what I felt was a sadomasochistic dynamic between natural language and code. It included an erotic poem featuring a kind of vampire DAO (far before I had familiarized myself with the unicorns and rainbows that better represent the Ethereum community).

But while my approach was unconventional, the idea dates back to a problem as old as philosophy itself. To borrow a metaphor from computers, human experience consists of abstractions: mere interfaces that we interact with. Base reality occurs on a lower level, corresponding to hardware and raw machine code.

This hierarchization of reality – of partitioning nature into the more and less real – occurs across philosophy in different guises and names. For some philosophers, such a partition gets us no further in understanding the “things-in-themselves.” Humans are encased by a sphere of representation, wholly cut off from an inaccessible and inhuman outside.

At the time, I believed the reality hierarchy had a linguistic equivalent. At the bottom were operational languages such as computer programming. At the top were descriptive, natural languages.

With this philosophical backdrop, code acquires a profound metaphysical weight. It became a way to transmute the lowest level of reality into human experience.

The DAO hack was the first crack in this worldview.

Inhuman intelligence

Implicitly, I maintained at the time that natural language was somehow inferior to the perfect objectivity of code.

Not only that, but I believed the behavior of technology within capitalism – its tendency toward monopolization, value-extraction and surveillance – was technology’s true nature revealing itself.

Martin Heidegger – a philosopher known for supporting the Nazi party and for transforming Western philosophy – calls this tendency Gestell, or enframing.

According to Heidegger, technology is a process of dismantling, quantifying and repackaging for export. In modernity, it has captured humanity, reducing people and everything else into a resource, a “standing reserve” to be exploited by the technological regime.

The DAO episode exposed many myths about blockchain, but this one stands out: Despite claims to the contrary, crypto contains an inextricably human element.

An equally controversial philosopher called Nick Land takes this process and gives it an agency.

According to Land, technology exposes an inhuman intelligence optimizing itself at the expense of the human. Stimulated by finance and a strange, contorting temporality, this inhuman intelligence is climbing its way up the reality hierarchy, threatening to replace the human as the world’s top predator.

It might sound like science fiction but crypto is full of this kind of rhetoric. Early efforts toward smart contracts promise nothing short of optimizing humans out of the equation. The blockchain is described as pure, trustless and incorruptible, turning all that it touches into glacial, inalterable code.

Ethereum’s infamous experiment in corporate governance, The DAO, echoed this language.

As Ethereum Classic fans will no doubt remember, The DAO was a high-profile fundraising campaign for a decentralized incubator. Its marketing spoke of “the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code” – a phrase whose irony is hard to forget.

Due to a vulnerability discovered in Solidity smart contracts not long after its launch, The DAO was subject to a re-entrancy attack, in which a hacker exploited a function within the code to drain 3.6 million ether out of it.

Following a heated discussion that resulted in the birth of a new cryptocurrency, ethereum classic (ETC), Ethereum developers implemented a controversial upgrade to refund DAO investors.

The DAO episode exposed many myths about blockchain, but this one stands out: Despite claims to the contrary, crypto contains an inextricably human element.

Not quite Skynet

I spent the subsequent years following the ebb and flow of Ethereum software development as a reporter for CoinDesk.

For two years I attended every single Ethereum core developer call. I tracked decision-making on the platform like a jealous lover, refreshing Twitter handles, expanding sprawling GitHub discussions, quietly watching chat groups.

Devcon2, Shanghai, China, 2016 Source: CoinDesk archives

During this time, Ethereum faced the fallout of its DAO refund and dealt with the challenge of informal, decentralized governance. This challenge was intensified by a few simple facts: Ethereum has a leadership that is ideologically opposed to authority, and a vision that is inclusive to the point of being meandering.

Criticisms aside, Ethereum was in uncharted territory. And despite the odds, the platform managed to keep its course, even with pressure from monetary interest pulling it from each side.

Over time, I understood the mistakes I had made. Ethereum is not Skynet, and code has much more in common with natural languages than the raw mechanics of primary nature. I learned that sometimes, developers actually trade efficiency for readability; favoring clear, modular code over code which is fast.

The general effort toward compliance was not only enabling certain forms of oppression but at times actively supporting it.

I also learned power exists on all decentralized networks, but it is typically nameless and therefore unaccountable. Over time, power relations solidify. Networks become institutionalized and the rift between users and developers deepens.

Software, I decided, is a social good, like water and clean air. To maintain the balance of power, coders must elevate those around them. They must discourage passive user-ship, inspire users to become active network participants and train the next generation of coders to replace them.

Democratic modernity

Armed with a newly found focus, I left the Ethereum beat to join the Rojava revolution in North Syria.

Inspired by the writings of Kurdish ideologue Abdullah Ocalan, the Rojava revolution sprang up during the Syrian Civil War. Its supporters maintain that the nation-state is an abstraction badly suited to the Middle East. In its place, Rojava is pioneering new forms of decentralized social organization.

But it is not merely a social organization that binds Rojava together. Rather, Rojava is governed by a collective idea: the concept of democratic modernity.

In his five-book manifesto written from Turkish prison island İmralı, Ocalan essentially agrees with Heidegger’s “Gestell” – there is a reductive, exploitative process at work within modernity.

But Ocalan does not identify this process with technology. According to him, it is the logic of capitalist civilization itself.

The task of democratic modernity is to decouple technology from globalization. In its place, new modernities can be built, based on a plurality of logics – not merely Western-style reductionism that has come to dominate the world.

In Rojava, learning is paramount. People are encouraged to develop “xwe zanîn,” or self-knowledge, inspired by the Ancient Greek maxim “know thyself.” This is a project of remembering, of resurfacing histories worn away by globalization.

Here, I spent my time establishing technical academies. Inspired by the scientific centers of the ancient world, like Plato’s Academy and the House of Baghdad, our goal was to train a new generation of philosophical programmers.

But my time in Rojava was cut short.

During the nine months I spent there, the risk of a Turkish invasion weighed heavily. It cast a dark shadow across all of our work, like a storm cloud looming in the distance.

Finally, the storm came, and the sky rained bullets and bombs. Disguised as a man, I was among the last foreigners to cross the border to safety before the death count started to rise.

Bad trip

I found myself at the Devcon5 Ethereum conference in Osaka, Japan, one week after leaving Syria.

With friends on the front line, I found it hard to look people in the eye. Ethereum’s unicorn-punk aesthetic set against the backdrop of war was hard to stomach.

Sleeplessly refreshing the Syrian Civil War subreddit and Syria Live Map on my phone, I watched the war play out in total horror.

Airstrikes, bombings, body counts. On stage, well-meaning developers called for diversity and social justice, innocent to, or oblivious of, the blanket of physical safety that surrounded them.

By suppressing its crypto-anarchist roots and whitewashing its aims to appeal to bankers, crypto has cut itself off from its source of power.

It was overpriced and sparsely attended. At a panel on Ethereum-based mixers an audience member warned that facilitating “bad guys” through privacy-tech could alienate the “average user” – a statement that was met with broad approval.

Maybe it was my state of mind, but it felt like the dissonance between cryptocurrency’s stated aims and its material reality was reaching a fever pitch. The general effort toward compliance was not only enabling certain forms of oppression but at times actively supporting it.

At that moment, I decided that anonymity is where all philosophy of technology collides. In technical terms, it is synonymous with freedom. Practically, it can mean life or death.

The Dark Renaissance

Since then, I have set about orchestrating the Dark Renaissance.

The Dark Renaissance is a revolution within cryptocurrency. It is a rallying cry to all who still believe in crypto’s true potential. It calls for a rebirth back to bitcoin’s original principles: to be autonomous, censorship-resistant and dark-by-design.

While crypto-anarchist in origin, bitcoin has lost its way. Rather than empowering black markets, it has allied with state and corporate interests – traded its radical potential for mainstream adoption.

But by suppressing its crypto-anarchist roots and whitewashing its aims to appeal to bankers, crypto has cut itself off from its source of power. The Dark Renaissance seeks to resurface that power, to allow the truly disruptive potential of cryptocurrency to realize itself.

That truly disruptive potential lies in cryptocurrency’s ability to extend the space of illegality outward: to increase the remit and power of unauthorized black market activity and strip resources away from the nation-state.

It’s impossible to say definitively how many people in Cuba use bitcoin. Brazil-based Cuban expat Claudia Rodriguez said her exchange served nearly 7,000 Cuban user accounts by November 2019. As of August 2020, she said, the exchange’s operations there stopped for legal reasons, including a lack of regulatory clarity from the Central Bank of Cuba.

“Due to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic and the new restrictions in Cuba, cryptocurrencies can be an efficient solution,” Rodriguez said. “It is a shame that we cannot continue to support the community at this time.”

Regardless, Cruz estimated there are now roughly 50,000 Cuban bitcoin users in this socialist nation of roughly 11.3 million people. He, like many Cubans sanctioned by the U.S., doesn’t acquire bitcoin through exchanges. Instead, Cruz earns his money abroad, with the help of a relative. The relative may send Cruz bitcoin as remittances or other forms of money as well.

“The money earned in Cuba is exchanged in the informal market to later buy [goods] in state-run or private stores,” Cruz said. “There [are] Cubans even making money with [both crypto and fiat] trading.”

Influencer economy

Cruz said his reliance on bitcoin swiftly went from 10% of his earnings to now a third of his household income.

Looking for products and services to manage his newfound crypto showed him there’s an opportunity for his YouTube channel to monetize Spanish-language crypto content.

“I realized that all these [crypto] platforms are simply pyramid schemes and scams that take advantage of ignorance,” Cruz said. “That is why I considered addressing those issues on [my] Bachecubano channel, to offer our correct point of view on how to use them.”

Cruz is now one of a small and widely dispersed group of Latin American influencers who use bitcoin for their daily work.

Fabiano Dias, vice president of business development at the startup Bitwage, said a couple of Latin American YouTubers use bitcoin as an international payments tool.

“We also serve YouTube streamers, which are few in numbers but large in volumes. It’s up to $20,000 a month for some of them,” Dias said, adding they are a minority among hundreds of monthly users from the tech industry.

Overall, Dias said Bitwage facilitated $2 million worth of transactions in July 2020, including work with companies like Paxful, half of which was in bitcoin. Dozens of YouTubers rely on Bitwage for fiat money management, especially in Argentina and Brazil. A couple of them use it for acquiring bitcoin as well. To be clear: Bitwage does not service Cuba or other countries sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

As for Cruz, he described Cuba’s crypto scene as “growing and gaining strength” throughout 2020.

“It’s a solution,” he said. “A pretty effective solution.”",2020-08-21 10:00:53+00:00

As Brazil’s biggest crypto exchanges agreed to self-regulate, next round of possible BTC stimulus checks is unlikely to come before October. Chinese firms could look to end their dollar dependence in international trade deals using blockchain technology, two of China’s biggest state-owned banks registered a number of blockchain, multiple South Korean banks could launch crypto custody services by the end of 2020, and the U.S. Postal Service filed a patent application for voting system using Ethereum. Meanwhile, North Korea’s “fast-developing tech abilities” could be helping it scale up its raids on international crypto exchanges.

Since 2009 when the world was introduced to Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have gained in value and traders. Today, the market capitalization is over US$300 billion, and experts predict we will continue to see an increase in the value of cryptocurrencies. While this is welcoming news for crypto traders, hackers looking to get a piece of the pie disrupted the market, stealing user logins and their funds. In 2019, investors lost $292,665,886 million worth of cryptocurrency. Security breaches are on the rise, fueling crypto traders’ need to take extra precautions when using exchanges and storing their cryptocurrencies. Before we look at the safety practices you can use to keep your crypto wallet safe and secure, let’s talk about some security risks.

What are the security risks?

Hackers are leveraging COVID-19 to exploit individuals. Online security risk surged in the early stages of the pandemic, with malicious attempts becoming more sophisticated. Unfortunately, the crypto market has not been spared from these attacks. The following are three security risks crypto traders are faced with:

Investor scams

Scammers posing as crypto traders or exchanges claiming high returns on cryptocurrencies have tricked unsuspecting victims. The scammers use social media and emails to target users. Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency on the market; it has been the most exploited digital currency for scammers.

Phishing scams

Emails claiming to come from legitimate sources such as charities and government agencies are increasing during the pandemic. Using COVID-19 as a cover-up, these phishing scams encourage persons to click on links to donate or purchase personal protective equipment. These links take persons to malicious sites where personal information can be exposed to hackers, including private keys for crypto exchanges.

Ransomware

With ransomware, a malicious program encrypts your system and files, then asks for a ransom to return or decrypt the files. Some ransomware programs request payment in cryptocurrency.

5 ways to protect your crypto wallet

Despite these security risks, crypto wallets remain one of the best options to secure your cryptocurrencies. How can you protect your wallet from malicious activities? Here are five ways:

Use a reliable password manager

The code for your private keys, which gives you access to your crypto wallet, can be challenging to remember. That is a security tactic. Rest easy by using a reliable password manager to store and retrieve your code. This means you will not have to worry about forgetting your private keys and being locked out of your wallet.

Download a VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) app is another way to strengthen your security. A VPN can encrypt your online connection, blocking hackers from monitoring your crypto exchanges. Many crypto traders use this tool to ensure their anonymity online.

Use two wallets

Consider keeping a small amount of cryptocurrency in your online wallet for trading purposes and keeping the rest in an offline wallet or ‘cold storage.’ That way, if malware tries to intercept your password for your online wallet, the rest of your funds are safely stored on a hard drive, USB, or paper and out of hackers’ reach.

Use two-factor authentication

Instead of using only one password to access your crypto wallet, two-factor authentication bolsters your security by requiring an additional code. The code can be sent to your phone as a text or an email and is only valid for a few minutes.

Update device software and antivirus

One of the best ways to fortify your device to reduce vulnerabilities is regularly updating the software and antivirus solution. These regular updates remove

vulnerabilities as soon as they appear to keep your device safe from malware attacks.

While you enjoy the delights of being a crypto owner, there are security risks that can make your crypto wallet volatile. This is why you should employ the right security measures to avoid security breaches.

By Luke Fitzpatrick

The cryptocurrency industry has spread around the world in only a few short years. Not too long ago, crypto industry leaders’ desires for crypto were grand, but even they would not have expected to see such progress so quickly.

These days, bitcoin and its altcoins have managed to infiltrate almost every industry. They are far from dominating them all, of course, but there are people in all industries who are now considering the use of crypto and its underlying blockchain technology, even banks, and entire nations.

China and its CBDC, the so-called digital yuan, are a prime example of this. But, this would not have been the case if a few, more flexible industries did not make the first step.

The sports industry is one of the best examples.

The sports industry and digital currency

The sports industry and crypto industry are maintaining an intimate relationship these days, but this was not always the case.

As mentioned, this was one of the more flexible industries that were not too scared to try out something new. Of course, it did not exactly throw itself into crypto, but it did open its doors to an alternative payment method.

It all began with gambling companies, and offshore sports betting websites. They started accepting crypto as a payment method. Soon enough, some of the sports club owners started paying their members in crypto, as well.

The first known example of this is a professional hockey player, Nikolaj Rosenthal, who currently also acts as the CEO of Evonax, which is one of the few remaining KYC-free exchange platforms. Back when it happened, Rosenthal stated: “It’s really exciting to be allowed to pioneer with this. Digital currencies could provide a lot of possibilities, and I appreciate the opportunity to experience them in such a unique way.”

After a while, when the initial coin offering (ICO) trend kicked off and everyone seemed to have launched their own coin, the idea also spread throughout the sports industry.

Fan tokens emerge

The ICO movement may have crashed in the meantime, but the idea of different clubs offering their fans different tokens remained. These days, some of the world’s largest sports clubs, such as Juventus and FC Barcelona, have their own tokens, meant to be distributed and used by their fans.

The fans can use the tokens for buying merchandise, voting on some upcoming club-related decisions, winning rewards such as VIP seats, and more.

Adrian Pollard from exchange provider bitHolla chimes in, “We’ve seen this attempt start all the way back to Fanship and I believe it is a great way to connect fans with stars in a much more interesting way that we’ve never thought of before. By mixing a token of value and effectively the worth of the star and having it trade on a marketplace we could be seeing a more direct way for fans to speculate on the worth of a star.”

However, all of that is only a bonus on what these clubs really wish to achieve, which is building a stronger community while connecting directly with their fans from anywhere in the world.

The fans would be able to interact with their favorite clubs, use their cryptocurrency, and participate in group decisions.

So, not only is crypto now used for gambling and betting, but it also serves for creating tighter, more directly served communities, and it comes as payment for sports players willing to accept them.

These are major advancements for an asset class that nobody took seriously only a few short years ago. And, while the sports industry is among the early adopters, similar acceptance of crypto is beginning to emerge in many other industries, as well.

eSports is also rather tight with the cryptocurrency, which leads directly into the gaming industry — another industry that was among the first to open its doors to crypto, and one of its biggest adopters thus far.

“I don’t think it will be long before we start seeing more stars self-tokenizing themselves. We are seeing early examples of this today even with ordinary people experimenting with it. But when it comes to actual sports stars or better yet potential sports stars it’s a good way for them to get the funding support they really need by tokenizing their future potential. I think the next natural step we will see is some stars having not only their own coin but their own marketplace to trade their token directly on their website,” says Pollard.

The new U.S. tax form is out and the cryptocurrency question is the first one on the main 1040 tax form used by about 150 million people to file their taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires all tax filers to declare whether they have received, sold, exchanged, or acquired any cryptocurrencies.

IRS Focuses on Crypto

The IRS has published a draft tax form for the 2020 filing. The question about cryptocurrency is now the very first one on Form 1040, the main tax form used by individual U.S. tax filers. Every year, about 150 million people use this form to file their taxes.

The question reads: “At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” It only requires a yes or no answer.

The IRS began including the cryptocurrency question in its tax form last year. However, the question was previously on Schedule 1, the form used for declaring “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.” Some tax experts believe that the agency’s crypto question is unconstitutional.

Twitter user Justin Winston Ono Wales, who said he is a crypto lawyer, believes that the IRS’ question “is way too broad and should be challenged.” He explained: “If you get paid in crypto, you must declare it as wages. If you realized gains from a crypto investment, you must declare it as a cap gain. But constitutionally, the gov should not know whether you purchased, received, or acquired crypto because crypto is not just money … public chains like Bitcoin requires a native currency (BTC) to access its network. BTC is sound money, but also much more,” adding:

The updated IRS form doesn’t ask you to list your crypto holdings (yet), but to declare if you received or sold crypto within the year no matter the reason. This information is beyond the purview of information the IRS needs to do its job.

The IRS has made no secret of attempting to collect more taxes from cryptocurrency owners. Last year, it sent out about 10,000 letters to people it suspected of owing crypto-related taxes reminding them to pay. However, the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, says the letters violated taxpayers’ rights.

The IRS issued new cryptocurrency tax guidance in October last year to update the one published in 2014. At the end of June, the agency requested information about privacy coins and technologies that obfuscate crypto transactions. The following month, bitcoin investor Jim Harper filed a lawsuit against IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig and a number of agents for unlawful seizure of financial records from crypto exchanges.

The team at Blockchain Research Lab said they had monitored twelve digital currency exchanges for different metrics related to Internet traffic and the “size of their administered user funds.”

The report states:

”The market for cryptocurrencies is notoriously prone to manipulation (Ante, 2019; Bitwise Asset Management, 2019; Cong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). One form of market manipulation is wash trading: trading volume artificially created by a manipulator who reports volume that does not actually exist (e.g. an exchange) or who executes trades against himself (e.g. a trader) and is not blocked by the exchange.”

Last year, the Blockchain Transparency Institute had claimed that OKEx and Bibox were the exchanges with the highest amount of wash trading.

In March 2019, Bitwise Asset Management also published a report on Bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes. The San Francisco-headquartered index fund provider found that around 95% of Bitcoin (BTC) trading volume, as reported on CoinMarketCap, was attributed to wash trading.

Blockchain Research Labs claims that the fake high trading volume due to wash trading raises the visibility of exchanges on popular websites that monitor cryptocurrency markets, like Coinmarketcap.com. Wash trading makes these trading platforms seem more attractive to investors who want to gain access to liquidity, the report noted.

However, this may lead to bad investment decisions based on false, misleading or inaccurate information. Wash trading can negatively impact the operations of legitimate exchanges, which may lose customers to unfair competition.

The report notes:

“The weak regulation of cryptocurrency markets makes them vulnerable to manipulation.”

The study classified digital asset exchanges into three groups. Exchanges with “little to no indication of wash trading,” including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Kraken, and Poloniex. A “mixed-evidence group” of Binance, HitBTC, KuCoin, and YoBit. And crypto exchanges that showed “overwhelming prior evidence” of wash trading included FCoin, Huobi, and OKEx.

(Note: To view the full report, check here.)

As covered in a separate report, crypto markets are plagued with manipulation, “endless” wash trading, but industry executives are confident about H2 2020 performance.

Compliant cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges accounted for only 1% of the trading volume of the sector during Q2 2020 with $21.62 billion in reported volume, according to a recent report.

In addition to allegedly engaging in market manipulation, major digital asset exchanges such as Binance and Huobi were used to transfer $2.8 billion in Bitcoin to criminals in 2019, according to a report from Chainalysis.",2020-08-16 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/1inch-exchange-announces-yield-farming-opportunity-upcoming-token-launch/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Just one week after the launch of Mooniswap and bagging $2.8 million from the biggest names in crypto investing, 1inch.exchange is taking their business a step further.

1inch yesterday has announced plans to launch the $1INCH token as well as its ambitions to completely decentralize their business.

The token itself is not an investment, and only 2% of the total supply can be earned through liquidity mining on Mooniswap, the platform’s native DEX.

The rest of the tokens are pre-distributed to 1inch’s core team, ecosystem development, investors, and advisors. Most of the tokens are vested over four years, with only 19.5% of tokens over 2.5 years for investors.

The 1INCH token will be used to ensure that integrations with protocols on the aggregator remain permissionless, to secure funds for ecosystem development, incentivize governance, and to stake for network security.

The team hasn’t released the token yet, but the announcement indicates a launch in the coming weeks. However, liquidity providers can begin earning 1INCH retroactively by participating in pre-approved liquidity pools listed in the recent announcement.

Many decentralized applications are turning to community governance as a way to ensure the long-term survival of their platform. The DeFi ecosystem is quickly transforming from crypto LLC’s to crypto corporations.

The importance of DAO governance is also on the rise, as Aave is on the brink of becoming fully decentralized. They follow both Maker’s and Synthetix’s decentralized initiatives.

It turns out he didn’t.

Apparently the OCC had been working on this letter for some time, according to regulatory sources who spoke to my colleague Nik De.

While this may sound like a “so what?” revelation, let’s zoom in on the interesting part: The OCC had been looking at this for some time.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

We don’t know exactly how long, but the act of writing an interpretive letter typically takes months, and the deliberations start well before the writing begins.

The takeaway here is that regulators in Washington have been working on how to support crypto innovation while protecting investors for longer than many realize. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for example, started looking closely at crypto assets as early as 2014, and other organizations no doubt also have had teams keeping an eye on developments since even before the 2017 bull run.

Politicians, also. This week we reported former U.S. Representative Cynthia Lummis won her primary race to join the U.S. Senate representing Wyoming, and is favored to win the general election. She bought her first bitcoin in 2013 and has been an advocate ever since.

We also reported the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, revealed he will accept bitcoin donations for his reelection campaign. He started reading about bitcoin four years ago.

These two are far from the only prominent politicians promoting further investigation into and support for cryptocurrencies, as Nathaniel Whittemore details in one of this week’s The Breakdown podcast episodes. In a convention season at a fraught time in American history, politicians will likely be more preoccupied with pressing issues such as the pandemic, civil unrest and the worst unemployment levels in a generation. Still, it wouldn’t surprise me to see more lawmakers express opinions on the potential role of crypto assets in financial innovation over the coming weeks.

What’s more, recent news items hint at the substantial resources being dedicated to crypto assets on the part of regulators, beyond the OCC’s work. Earlier this month it emerged that the Securities and Exchange Commission had submitted a procurement request for a tool to analyze smart contracts and detect security vulnerabilities, which suggests a sophisticated level of interest in decentralized finance. And a few weeks ago the agency awarded a contract to CipherTrace on the grounds that it was the only blockchain forensics firm at the time that could support analysis of Binance Coin.

Not all regulators are moving at the same speed, and there are always individuals with less progressive attitudes. But the different regulators talk to each other, they gather at the same events (or they used to, anyway), they sometimes exchange employees. There are demarcations, but they do influence each other.

And so, it’s encouraging to know the first steps in the opening up of crypto services to traditional finance does not depend on the happenstance of having an Acting Comptroller familiar with crypto assets’ potential impact. It also means the OCC’s recent bold move is probably not the only welcome surprise we’ll see from an official body this year.

Bitcoin on Ethereum

By now, most observers of the crypto markets are aware that there’s Bitcoin, and there’s Ethereum, and they are very different. Bitcoin is a digital form of hard money with a limited supply and a decentralized protocol. Ethereum is also a decentralized protocol but its token does not have a limited supply and is more focused on enabling innovative applications.

Only, now there’s bitcoin on Ethereum.

Wrapped BTC (WBTC), an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by bitcoin, launched in February 2019 as a joint initiative between decentralized exchange startups Kyber Network and Republic Protocol, as well as cryptocurrency custody company BitGo. From the beginning, several marketplaces and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects pledged to support the token, which, according to Bloxy, now has over 3,200 unique holders, more than double the figure in early May.

Circulating supply of wBTC vs number of unique token holders Source: bloxy.info

What is the appeal? Recently, several DeFi applications have emerged that pay attractive yields on cryptocurrencies. Most DeFi applications run on Ethereum, leaving yield-hungry BTC holders no option but to rely on centralized lending platforms that generally pay less. Bitcoin wrapped in an Ethereum token, however, would be eligible, allowing bitcoin holders to earn more interest than they could off the Ethereum blockchain.

Other bitcoin-backed Ethereum-based tokens have since emerged, such as tBTC, but wBTC is the market leader for now, accounting for two thirds of all BTC on Ethereum. My colleague Zack Voell reported earlier this week there was more wBTC minted between Aug. 9-14 than there were bitcoins mined in that period.

New BTC vs new wBTC Source: Dune Analytics, Coin Metrics

While the whole DeFi evolution is captivating, the explosion of interest in Ethereum-based BTC is particularly interesting on two fronts:

1) The “culture clash” between Bitcoiners and Ethereum supporters is at times public and loud. Here we have the two working together in what could end up being a symbiotic harmony that enhances the attractiveness of both. Ethereum will continue to encourage decentralized finance innovation, only with even more liquidity. And bitcoin will continue to be a digital store of value appreciated for its scarcity, only with even more yield opportunities.

2) This could change the bitcoin “intrinsic value” equation. Bitcoin does not generate yield.

This is sometimes cited as a barrier to investment. If idle bitcoin can generate a yield, does that give it a utility that it did not previously have? What would this do to bitcoin’s use case as a store of value, akin to digital gold?

The growth is worth paying attention to. There are now over 45,000 BTC locked up on Ethereum, according to btconethereum.com. This is still relatively low, considering that the current BTC supply is over 18 million. But it is more than double the amount just two weeks ago.

And the ideas are just warming up. Earlier this week Leigh Cuen reported on a project working on incorporating bitcoin into decentralized finance projects without having to put it on Ethereum.

Just when you thought you understood what bitcoin’s eventual use case would be, innovation does its thing.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

Markets didn’t have the most exciting of weeks, but things seem to be getting more dramatic.

Tech stocks got another boost of energy, as the Nasdaq Composite index soared ahead of the S&P 500 in terms of weekly performance. It even handily beat bitcoin, although month to date the cryptocurrency is still ahead.

Bitcoin took a run at the beginning of a price spike, but ran out of steam almost right away and retreated to its now comfortable range of $11K+.

The five-year TIPS/Treasury breakeven rate (the rate of inflation that would make Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities returns equal Treasury returns, an indicator of market expectations) is almost back up to pre-pandemic levels. (The higher this rate is, the higher investors think inflation will be, on average, over the next half-decade.) Given parallel expectations of higher unemployment and lower economic growth, this data point hints that forces other than consumer demand are at work.

People are starting to talk about the risks to the market of a vaccine. The fear is that, if people start feeling optimistic again, they might start spending and that might mean inflation which could point to rate increases and the mother of all “taper tantrums.” This thinking is nuts.

At this stage, if I were trying to cram all of this into a screenplay, I’d be panicking about how to come up with an ending spectacular enough to justify such head-scratching plot twists. Suggestions welcome.

George Ball, former president of E.F. Hutton in its heyday (older readers may remember the classic TV ads), former CEO of Prudential Securities and current CEO of financial services firm Sanders Morris Harris, suggested in a Reuters interview that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies could be “a safe haven” for investors and traders as an alternative investment. He went on to say that bitcoin is “very attractive” as something that “can’t be undermined by the government,” and predicted more people will turn to the crypto market after Labor Day. TAKEAWAY: The chorus of mainstream voices publicly supporting bitcoin is getting louder. This is significant, especially now – in an investment world in which few have a firm grasp of what’s driving markets, the power of narrative has a driving role, especially when told by familiar faces.

Major Chinese bitcoin mining pools are each seeing daily hashrate drops of 10% to 20% following continuous rainstorms in Sichuan. Some mining farms are being forced to unplug due to electricity and internet disruptions, and others have paused operations in order to evacuate on-site staff for safety reasons. TAKEAWAY: A reminder that geographical spread of mining operations is crucial for Bitcoin’s security, especially if we are going to be having more extreme weather events.

Speaking of the geographical diversity of mining operations, Colorado-based bitcoin mining company Riot Blockchain is buying 8,000 additional S19 Pro Antminers. TAKEAWAY: This is a capital investment of over $17 million, not an insignificant amount for a company whose revenue declined and losses deepened in Q2. Given that the miner rewards for processing blocks are now almost 50% less than they were a few months ago, this level of expenditure points to strong optimism about the bitcoin price.

A bitcoin transfer was successfully sent between Earth and the International Space Station using dedicated hardware installed on the spacecraft. TAKEAWAY: Those of you out there who enjoy sci-fi will appreciate the glimpse of how extraterrestrial payments might function without a central bank.

According to data from Glassnode, the number of bitcoins held in exchange addresses has fallen to a 21-month low. TAKEAWAY: This could mean that more investors are holding their bitcoins in external custody solutions, rather than leave them on exchanges ready to trade. If so, this implies less selling pressure and possibly more bullish momentum.

Crypto lender BlockFi has closed a $50 million Series C round, led by Morgan Creek Capital, Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, CMT Digital, Castle Island Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and others. TAKEAWAY: That’s a hefty raise, even without adding it to the nearly $50 million already raised since August 2019. This speaks to the growing interest in crypto-backed lending products, which point to a deepening maturity in the space, which in turn is likely to trigger more demand for crypto-backed lending products, and so on. The industry will change if (when?) financial institutions start to get involved, but until then, the centralized crypto lending pie is getting bigger and consolidating around BlockFi and Genesis, with Coinbase a new entrant that could make waves.

Despite this, there are signs U.S. stock markets could be overvalued. The Buffett indicator, an analysis tool which divides the Wilshire 5000 Index by the U.S. GDP, currently shows 1.7. This figure is quite near to the dot-com era top at 1.71 which was followed by a strong market correction.

However, one major difference between now and the dot-com era is that the current interest rates are at record lows and central banks have been pumping huge amounts of money to support the economy.

Although certain pockets could be looking like a bubble, it is unlikely that the stock markets will crash because of this metric alone.

If the stock markets did crash, Bitcoin (BTC) might dip initially due to souring sentiment, but the price is unlikely to remain low for long because traders who sold their positions in the stock markets will look at safe haven assets to park their money.

Recent Bitcoin investments by hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and the increased institutional inflow in Grayscale Investments products shows that traders are looking at Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.

For the past few months several altcoins have been strongly outperforming Bitcoin. Let’s analyze a few of the altcoins that could do well in the next few days.

BTC/USD

The bulls pushed Bitcoin above the $12,304.37 resistance on Aug. 17 but failed to sustain above it. This attracted profit booking by the short-term traders on Aug. 18, which has pulled the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,568).

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The average directional index (ADX), a component of the directional movement indicator, remains strong above 35 but the positive directional indicator (+DI) and the negative directional indicator (-DI) are coming close to each other and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, suggesting a range-bound action in the near term.

If the bears can sustain the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the $11,000–$10,900 zone is possible. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively and if they succeed, the pair could again rally to $12,304.37. A breakout and close (UTC time) above this resistance is likely to resume the up move.

However, if the bears sink the price below $10,900, a retest of $10,400 is likely. This is an important support to watch out for because if this breaks down, the sentiment will turn hugely negative.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The -DI is above the +DI and the 20-EMA is sloping down on the 4-hour chart, which suggests that bears have the upper hand in the short-term. They are aggressively selling on pullbacks to the 20-EMA.

On the downside, the $11,000 level is likely to act as a strong support. A strong bounce off it will keep the pair range-bound between $11,000–$12,304.37 for a few days.

The first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-EMA as that will suggest a change in sentiment in the short-term.

ETH/USD

The failure of the bulls to sustain Ether (ETH) above the immediate support at $415.634 resulted in profit booking by the short-term traders. This has pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($393), which is a negative sign.

ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The next support on the downside is $366. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the bulls are defending this support. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the +DI and -DI are close to one another, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.

This points to a possible range-bound action between $366–$446.479 for a few days. A breakout above the range is likely to resume the uptrend while a break below it can result in a decline to the next support at $320.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the -DI is above the +DI and the 20-EMA is sloping down, suggesting an advantage to the bears in the short-term. Previously, the $366 support had acted as a strong support, hence, the bulls will again attempt to defend this level.

A strong bounce off it could result in a rally to $415.634. If the price turns down from this resistance, then a few days of range-bound action is possible.

Conversely, if the $366 support breaks, it will be a huge negative that could result in a decline to $320.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) has broken above the $7.249 resistance today, which is a huge positive as this suggests a possible resumption of the uptrend. The ADX is above 30 and the +DI is above the -DI, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

ATOM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls can close (UTC time) the price above $7.249, the next target to watch out for is $8.50 and then $10.

However, if the bears sell at higher levels and pull the price back below $7.249, a drop to $6.604 is possible. If the ATOM/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will again attempt to resume the uptrend.

Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $6.604, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. Below this support, a drop to $5.423 is likely.

ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bullish momentum picked up after the buyers pushed the price above the $6.604 resistance. Although the bears attempted to stall the up move at $7.249, strong buying by the bulls soaked up all the selling.

The 20-EMA is sloping up and the +DI has risen above the -DI, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside. A break below $7.249 will be the first sign that the bullish momentum has weakened.

NEO/USD

The ADX in NEO is above 57 and the 20-day EMA ($15.38) is sloping up, which suggests that the trend favors the bulls. However, the bears are attempting to stall the up-move at $19.82219.

NEO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

This could result in a minor correction or consolidation that is likely to find support at $16.72441 and below it at the 20-day EMA.

If the NEO/USD pair rebounds off either support, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above $20.9633. If they succeed, the next target on the upside is $25.23.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the momentum has weakened.

NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $19.82219. Currently, the 20-EMA is sloping up, which suggests that the advantage is with the bulls.

If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make another attempt to push the price above the resistance. If they succeed, the uptrend is likely to resume.

Conversely, a break below the 20-EMA will weaken the bullish momentum and could result in a drop to $15.64796–$16.72441 support zone. A bounce off this zone could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.

CRO/USD

Crypto.com Coin (CRO) has been range-bound between $0.15306–$0.176596 for the past few days. In an uptrend, when the price consolidates near the overhead resistance, it is a positive sign because it suggests that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry.

CRO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ADX is above 31 and the +DI is above the -DI, which suggests that the advantage is with the bulls. Although the bulls had pushed the price above $0.176596 on Aug. 21, they could not sustain the higher levels.

However, the positive thing is that the buyers have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA ($0.164). If the bulls can again propel the price above $0.176596, the uptrend is likely to resume.

The first target is $0.191101 and above it $0.20. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the CRO/USD pair below $0.15306.

CRO/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattish, which suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears.

However, the pair has formed a series of higher lows, which has resulted in an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.176596.

The first sign of weakness will be a break below the trendline. Such a move can drag the price down to the critical support at $0.15306. A break below this level will shift the advantage in favor of the bears.

Key Takeaways IOTA is at risk of running out of cash, which is exacerbated by tensions between co-founders and lack of commercial use cases of Tangle, the protocol’s consensus mechanism.

IOTA remains centralized and its ecosystem is still small.

Nevertheless, IOTA shows signs of maturing as it adapts to the market's realities.

IOTA is working on expanding its market opportunities by taking on a more pragmatic approach towards the development of its technology. However, the team has yet to overcome the critical issues plaguing the project.

The major roadblocks for IOTA’s evolution include centralization, lack of commercial use cases, and a small ecosystem. Moreover, the team may soon run out of money, and one of the co-founders is bent on emptying what little is left of the coffers.

It’s a sink-or-swim moment for IOTA, and now is the time for the team to prove itself.

Making the IOTA Technology Work

IOTA began in 2015, when the Internet of Things (IoT) market, IOTA’s key business vertical, was in its infancy.

Five years later, the IoT space is growing much faster, and critical infrastructure is actively being built. Hence, IOTA’s adoption prospects are only going to increase.

To capitalize on the expanding opportunities, IOTA has to provide practical working solutions to enterprises and organizations. Previously, this was a problem, given the team’s focus on fringe innovations like ternary logic, which, to this day, isn’t fully embraced by hardware producers.

In 2020, however, the project has made moves to prioritize conventional software development.

Without casting aside innovative ideas, the team focused on improving the usability and efficiency of the current version of the Tangle. The improvements like faster transactions, automatic connection to neighboring nodes, and reusable addresses are coming to the mainnet with Chrysalis, an interim update before the network’s decentralization event, Coordicide, occurs.

Although the team has yet to provide users with concrete timeframes, it has offered a degree of transparency via a live version of the roadmap and frequent updates on social media. The release of Coordicide specifications and the launch of the IOTA 2.0 testnet indicate the team’s determination to deliver a working product as soon as possible.

The team’s dedication is visible on GitHub. GoShimmer node software, which is a crucial element of Coordicide, has seen an uptick in development activity in 2020.

Still, Coordicide is not a new concept, and it was announced a while ago.

Since then, there has been no deadline for its implementation. The negative feedback on the development process from a former member of IOTA’s former Developer Advocate of the Ecosystem team, Philipp Blum, elevates concerns.

Overall, the fact that the team prioritized conventional development practices over innovating, for the time being, is somewhat promising.

Given that the project spent years on research, issues with changing internal politics shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s more important that the team is beginning to deliver working solutions.

IOTA Foundation Running Out of Money

The spike in the team’s activity is dictated by the depleting financial resources of the IOTA Foundation. For now, the Foundation has slightly over 59.6 Trillion MIOTA (Ti) tokens valued at $23.8 million at current prices.

Over the past year, the project’s average monthly burn rate was 4.6 Ti. At such a rate, IOTA Foundation has until August 2021 before it runs out of its crypto holdings.

There is an Ecosystem Development Fund, and some cash might still be left from the initial €1 million ($1.17M) endowment from the co-founders. Considering how much the team spends, however, these sources aren’t enough to alleviate the risk.

The crypto market’s crash in March 2020 worsened the situation. Although IOTA followed the altcoin bullish trend, the price has recovered to its pre-crash levels in August. Meanwhile, the Foundation was cashing out at a discount.

One of IOTA’s co-founders, Sergey Popov, told Crypto Briefing that the project also gets funding from some companies and government agencies.

Although Popov couldn’t share the exact percentage share of grants versus token liquidations, he stated that the inflows from partners are substantial.

Meanwhile, the team strives to expand its partnership network and secure more financing. Recent initiatives include creating Tangle EE, a working group for organizations to develop enterprise-grade solutions with Dell Technologies and STMicroelectronics.

The major predicament with the partnerships may come from the lengthy enterprise development cycle. The project has to boost its commercial adoption to increase cash flows, but launching products for enterprises can take months or even years. It’s a common practice, but IOTA doesn’t have much of a runway to be comfortable with the wait.

The risk of the IOTA Foundation going bust is exacerbated by the tensions between the project’s co-founders.

Sergey Ivancheglo, one of the former members of the Board of Directors and IOTA’s co-founder, shared pictures of a letter to the IOTA Foundation, where he asks the team to transfer over 80 Ti to his wallet, which means almost all of the project’s crypto holdings.

IOTA has a long history of the core team’s internal conflicts. Ivancheglo’s seemingly peaceful departure from the project’s Board of Directors in July 2019 turned into a heated confrontation between him and IOTA founder, David Sønstebø.

Ivancheglo’s letter was sent from a Minsk based law firm. If he were to file a lawsuit and win, the IOTA Foundation would be in a tough position. Even if he doesn’t, the reputational damage is not small.

In either case, IOTA suffers because it’s still centralized in the hands of quarreling founders.

Decentralization Means Unstoppable Progress

Initial centralization is a consequence of IOTA’s architecture. Without the centralized node called “Coordinator,” the network could be abused by malicious actors.

While the team aims to kill the Coordinator, it’s still functioning, meaning that the IOTA Foundation still has full control over the Tangle. The latest incident with the project’s official wallet, Trinity, shows the negative impact of this.

Trinity had a critical vulnerability, as it shared users’ private keys with a third-party payments platform Moonpay. The vulnerability was eventually exploited, and hackers stole between $300,000 and $1.2 million in MIOTA.

Due to the hack, the Foundation paused financial transactions on the network for almost a month. Hence, if anything happens to the IOTA Foundation, the system may lose some or all of its functionality. This turns the Foundation into a significant single point of failure.

Since IOTA’s major risks are connected to the Foundation, the best course of action would be to distribute control over the Tangle between large, reputable entities.

It’s a reasonable step for an enterprise-focused project, which can be seen via examples like Hedera Hashgraph.

Decentralization through businesses and governments could remove not only the central point of failure but also foster the growth of IOTA’s ecosystem. Node owners would also benefit from pushing IOTA’s adoption among their large user bases.

Still, to achieve the above, the Coordicide must happen, and the Foundation has to step down as the entity controlling the network.

It involves both rapid software development and the professional approach of the core team.

The Chance of Failure Runs High

Despite the positive shifts in IOTA’s strategy, the project still has to overcome significant obstacles. It’s pressed for time, and the cost of error is high. IOTA still has a chance to make it through, considering the team’s approach. But this chance is diminishing by the day.

UPD (Aug 30, 2020): After the article was published, IOTA Foundation contacted Crypto Briefing and denied that the project’s runway ends by August 2021.

It quickly gained the attention of many crypto enthusiasts and investors, growing dramatically in size. The protocol has attracted as many detractors as it has supporters over the years. From its approach of adapting existing technologies into its platform (which some people argued were much further than inspiration) to a heavy reliance on marketing and publicity stunts than any meaningful technological advances. Tron has remained a controversial project from the very beginning.

Perhaps the most popular move by the Tron Foundation was the purchase of the BitTorrent network and then releasing a token for it on the Tron protocol. This allowed the project to advertise its services to millions of users of the peer-to-peer file-sharing application. However, some users did not welcome the promotional campaign.

Click to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies on the leading peer-to-peer crypto exchange.

The project which is based in China has also distinguished itself by heavily promoting in the Asian Pacific region. It routinely translates the documentation of the protocol to several of the most used languages in Asia and also creates viral campaigns with influencers to draw more people into the network.

It is safe to say, Tron has taken a different approach than most Decentralized Ledger Protocols (DLT) out there. Most of the other projects try to gain traction by introducing new technologies and features to the ecosystem. Tron relies more on a heavy emphasis on advertising with a somewhat unimpressive technological development. As stated before, most of the core functioning of Tron is made from technology already pioneered by other projects.

Despite all these, Tron is one of the most exciting crypto investments out there. This is especially so for Nigerians looking to enter the crypto economy by buying an undervalued cryptocurrency with massive potential.

Most other DLT projects attract the kind of people who deeply care about consensus algorithms, data architecture design, encryption, and other core technologies. These people, although important, won’t be the majority of the users when a protocol becomes successful. Most people don’t know or care that much about the tech, they just want a good UI that is easy to use and understand. This is where Tron excels. So, let’s give a basic overview of how the Tron network works.

An introduction to Tron

As we said before, Tron launched in 2017. Initially, it created an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network as a way to finance the project. At the start of 2018 investors who got the token trade it for one running on the Tron network which already had some basic functionalities at the time. Since then, all Tron tokens have been running on the network and now it has become a coin, with the ticker TRX, since it is the native token of its protocol.

The Tron teamwork is comprised of three layers:

Core system: As with many other Blockchains Tron uses a Virtual Machine (VM). Here, computers send instructions written in Java or Solidity to the VM which are turned into bytecode that can be run on any system. This means Tron also has a global state, each transaction in the network has to be broadcasted to the whole system. This is how the protocol keeps track of account balances.

Application Layer: This is where applications and smart contracts interact with the Blockchain. It is there for developers and companies to utilize when creating new services.

Storage: It is the section that saves the information that is written directly into the Blockchain by the users and the smart contracts.

Consensus algorithm: The Tron Network runs by using Delegated Proof of State (DPoS). The network has a group of twenty-seven “Super Representatives” which validate transactions and propose the next block. Now, these representatives are not always the same, they change on a periodic basis. The Super Representatives rotate on a 6 hours basis.

Blocks in the Tron network are created every three seconds. The reward given by the network for every successful block produced is 32 TRX, which gives a total of 336,384,000 coins given as a reward per year. In order to be able to receive this reward, a user needs to stake its Tron on the network.

In order to vote, users lock an amount of TRX coins in a contract. This means that these funds are taken out of circulation for a period of time. In exchange for doing this, the user receives “Tron Power” which is equal to One Power per One TRX locked in the network. This allows the participants to vote, and delegate their stake to the Super Representatives, so as to gain rewards in TRX that can then be traded when the funds are withdrawn from the network.

As we can see, this is a rather common design for a Blockchain. No concept introduced here is new or particularly revolutionary. Yet, this tried and true approach means Tron is easy to understand for developers and users alike. Now let’s review some of the most promising projects out there.

Tether on Tron

That is right, the most popular FIAT backed stable coin in the market is partially issued on the Tron network. It was created in April of 2019 using the TRC-20 standar. Again, Tron is not particularly original in this regard. The token is accepted in some major exchanges out there such as Binance, Polinex, OKEX, KuCoin, and many others. As of the time of writing, there are 500 million dollars of USDT issued on Tron circulating in the markets.

As the Ethereum network gets congested due to its limitations and the rise of DeFi, gas prices get more expensive. This makes using Tether on Ethereum a very expensive transaction. Here is where Tether on Tron can become an excellent alternative. Any Nigerian used to using Tether can have the same reliable experience with the Tron alternative, minus the high costs of using Ethereum.

Read about everything you need to know about Defi apps and why ETH gas fee is on the rise.

Tron Card

The Tron card is a secure digital wallet hosted on the Tron network. It is capable of storing several cryptocurrencies and tokens not native to Tron. It is also a payment processor directly connected to the Tron Blockchain.

Tron Arcade

This is a 100 million USD fund designed to bolster game development using the Tron network. The project sees games as one of the main drivers of adoption in the industry right now. It already saw success when the popular game, CryptoDungeons decided to move their entire operation over to Tron. The use of games as the main funnel for adoption is not as crazy as it sounds.

Find out the effect of blockchain on the gaming industry.

As we can see Tron is a different kind of project. Most of the other Blockchains focus on cutting edge technology and hope the general public will be as excited by them as they are. Tron is a far more consumer focus operation that relies on proven tech and mass marketing for adoption.

Banks all over the world have been squeezed by the pandemic. Within the U.S., Wells Fargo & Co., for instance, is slashing prices and reducing workers to attempt to journey out the disaster, strikes that would maintain clues for the way different giant U.S. banks may reply. Wells got here into the disaster in worse form than some U.S. rivals however in higher form than many European lenders, which have toiled for years as margins have been squeezed by low rates of interest within the wake of the final monetary disaster.

European banks commerce at lower than half their ebook value, whereas U.S. banks commerce at greater than four-fifths of ebook value. The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index is down 36% this 12 months whereas the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index has fallen 12%.

France’s BNP Paribas SA and Société Générale SA are amongst nationwide champions which can be scaling again world ambitions to give attention to their dwelling economies.

Within the UK., Barclays PLC, for years styling itself as a mini JPMorgan Chase & Co. spanning retail and funding banking, is below stress from an activist investor to slash its buying and selling enterprise.

A few of Europe’s banks, together with HSBC, ABN and Credit score Suisse, have new CEOs this 12 months who’ve seized on the pandemic as a catalyst to make adjustments to their banks’ enterprise models.

HSBC Chief Government Noel Quinn hit pause on deliberate job cuts on the lender when the coronavirus hit however stated these must speed up now to tug out prices. Round 35,000 of the bank’s 235,000-strong workforce will go — by exiting a lot of continental Europe and shutting U.S. branches — as a part of a seamless world retreat to refocus on its extra worthwhile Asian heartland.

In an interview, Mr. Quinn stated he plans to spend money on know-how to chop prices. He employed John Hinshaw, a former chief info officer at Verizon Wi-fi and Boeing Co., late final 12 months to assist the bank turn out to be extra digital. Nation lockdowns led extra prospects to on-line banking and cellphone apps, and that pattern is prone to speed up, in accordance with bankers and analysts.

“Banking continues to be banking however know-how has an more and more vital function to play in it,” Mr. Quinn stated.

ABN Amro is returning to its roots, too, with the ambition of latest CEO Robert Swaak to be “the most effective Dutch bank” with a give attention to northwest Europe. He stated earlier this month that ABN will exit company banking within the U.S., Asia, Australia and Brazil, and a trade-finance enterprise that traces again to colonial occasions.

Geographical diversification was seen as a technique to offset weak spot when one market cooled, stated John Ahern, a companion at Covington who advises banks on regulation. “In coronavirus, you might have a worldwide economic system nearly in shutdown. You are not leveraging a bonus and will be uncovered to too many difficult markets,” he stated.

Barclays Chief Government Jes Staley for years has argued that geographic and business-line variety makes banks extra resilient in a disaster, after serving to steer JPMorgan by means of the final monetary disaster. He crafted Barclays to emulate his former employer, with a big UK. bank serving companies and households, a world credit-card arm and funding banking in London and New York.

Mr. Staley claimed victory for his technique within the second quarter as revenue from Barclays’ company and funding bank rose 16% to GBP694 million ($908 million) whereas its UK. unit swung to a GBP123 million loss.

Activist investor Edward Bramson did not agree. He argues that Barclays’ buying and selling revenues are unstable and poor high quality as a result of the bank does not have the massive corporate-client or wealth-management companies that drive buying and selling flows at larger rivals like JPMorgan.

Mr. Bramson’s agency, Sherborne Traders, says it’s the largest Barclays shareholder with a 5.9% stake. He renewed calls this month for the bank to comply with the instance of Deutsche Bank AG and downsize its buying and selling arm. Deutsche Bank shares have risen 13% this 12 months, whereas Barclays shares have slumped 40%.

Mr. Bramson stated Deutsche Bank had proven that buying and selling companies will be pared down with out deadly results, and described Deutsche Bank’s funding bank as “a extra viable enterprise than earlier than.” Barclays declined to remark.

The wave of restructuring may very well be the precursor to long-talked-of consolidation, bankers and legal professionals say. The European Central Bank has stated it might ease the best way for future mergers, and gave its blessing to a takeover by Intesa Sanpaolo SpA of native Italian rival UBI Banca SpA.

In the meantime, banks that went by means of prolonged restructurings earlier than are discovering methods to be leaner by means of the pandemic.

Thomas Gottstein, CEO at Credit score Suisse since February, stated the pandemic was the set off for making additional adjustments to decrease prices and unlock cash for funding after an earlier restructuring below predecessor Tidjane Thiam. Credit score Suisse and rival UBS to this point have fared higher within the pandemic than most different European banks due to their traditionally low-loss Swiss loan books and give attention to banking for the world’s wealthy.

Credit score Suisse is combining a number of market-trading companies and integrating its danger and compliance capabilities to spend money on development, Mr. Gottstein stated.

Bitcoin’s price opened the week heading higher, hitting $11,823 on Monday before dipping lower. “Bitcoin has settled into a consolidation position at $11,700,” said Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at cryptocurrency exchanges OKCoin. “It appears that traders are waiting for better fills at $11,000,” he added.

Darius Sit, managing partner of quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, expects the final full week of August to be quieter than earlier in the month, when the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hit a 2020 high of $12,485 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.

“One thing we were looking at is that August tends to be a weak month for both BTC and ETH,” said Sit. “So if that seasonality plays out, this last week of August might see some weakness.”

Spot volumes on major BTC/USD exchanges Monday are low. For Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, for example, it was just $27 million, well below its $91 million daily average.

Interestingly, there are more addresses now with 1,000 or more bitcoin than ever before. The count of those on the “Bitcoin Rich List” has reached a high of 2,190. Those addresses hold nearly 7.87 million BTC, the equivalent of $92.2 billion.

Nonetheless, many stakeholders who are usually bullish are expecting some retrenchment from bitcoin’s price gains, including Rupert Douglas, head of institutional trading for digital asset broker Koine. “We’ve come a long way quickly. I wouldn’t be surprised by a pause or a pullback,” Douglas said. OKcoin’s Koehler echoed that sentiment. “Momentum is still signaling bullish, but it’s unclear if we should test the $10,000 breakout area before moving higher,” said.

Douglas also noted ether (ETH) continues to steal bitcoin’s spotlight. “Overall, ETH is stronger and I think will continue to outperform BTC,” he said.

Into the ether

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $401 and climbing 2.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The amount of “gas” used, denoted in gwei, worth 0.000000001 ether on the Ethereum network, hit an all-time high Sunday, reaching 79,294,213,632 gwei, according to aggregator Glassnode. A unit of measure to execute operations on the network, gas is used within Ethereum to conduct transactions or use smart contracts. The record amount of gas used is viewed as a sign that Ethereum’s utility for decentralized finance, or DeFi, is higher than ever.

However, George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis CapitaI, has concerns whether Ethereum’s heavy usage can be sustained given that average fees for using the network have gone as high as $6.68 in August. “I think the gas issue is leaving Ethereum vulnerable,” he said, “vulnerable to competing smart contract public blockchains. Something has to give.”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has published a video explaining what cryptocurrency is. Besides suggesting that cryptocurrency could “completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills,” the video states that it “could be the next step in the evolution of money.”

IMF Explains Crypto

The IMF tweeted a video explaining what cryptocurrency is on Sunday that instantly went viral. Referring to cryptocurrency as “a special currency,” the two-minute video attempts to outline its benefits in payments, such as by removing middlemen, lowering costs, and increasing transaction speed. It also warns of what it sees as risks, such as anonymity and volatility. The video has garnered more than 523K views at the time of writing; it has been retweeted 5.5K times, liked 8.2K times, and received 807 comments. The video ends with:

If we can counter the risks, then this new technology or some variation of it can completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills. And who knows, this could be the next step in the evolution of money.

The video references the IMF’s F&D (Finance & Development) magazine, June 2018 edition, entitled “Money, Transformed – The future of currency in a digital world.” When that magazine edition came out, the organization posted the above video on its Youtube channel, which received little interest at the time.

Many people in the crypto space view the IMF’s video as bullish. Tweets such as “IMF learning fast. Global adoption is on its way,” “This is a big deal,” and “They are finally understanding blockchain and cryptocurrency are not going away” flooded Twitter. One user wrote: “I still can’t believe I see this. IMF shills cryptocurrencies, of course, not bitcoin yet, but that time will come too.”

Since the IMF’s crypto explainer video does not mention any specific cryptocurrency, many commenters took the opportunity to promote their favorite coins.

Some people, however, criticize the content of the IMF video, saying that the information is misleading and omits many important points, including mining. Many also believe that bitcoin should have been mentioned. “Nothing about why people choose to store their wealth in a scarce currency like bitcoin instead of fiat currencies that are benign constantly debased by banksters and cantillionaires,” one user tweeted. “You forgot one fundamental difference between fiat and bitcoin. Fiat is printable by centralized entities like government & banks, whereas BTC is decentralized and has a limit cap to its supply where only 21 million will ever exist in this universe. All powered by blockchain,” another wrote.

Some questioned who the “bad guys” in the video are supposed to be and frowned upon it referring to private keys as passwords. Some say the video gives the appearance that all cryptocurrencies share the properties of bitcoin, and some suspect that the IMF is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency. One user noted that this video is set up like a “Prelude to their own crypto coin that will come out at some point fixing all the problems with crypto” that the IMF has outlined in this video.

The question is somewhat problematic because blockchain is an infrastructure, operating in the background — out of sight — that runs across multiple industries and domains.

In an effort to shed some light on this point at issue, Cointegraph Magazine informally surveyed industry thought leaders to complete this sentence, “We will know blockchain has gone mainstream when _______.”

Michael Peshkam, executive in residence at European business school INSEAD, told Cointelegraph Magazine that there were over 50 million Blockchain wallet users at the end of June 2020. “Traditionally this is the number of users [needed] to accept that a technology has gone mainstream.” It took the automobile 62 years to reach the “magic” 50-million-user mark, the telephone 50 years, electricity 46 years, and the internet seven years.

We are in a networked world today, of course, where a technology can spread at an exponential rate — and the world also has many more consumers than in Henry Ford’s time — so it isn’t really fair to compare discrete items like automobiles or telephones to encrypted, distributed digital ledgers. For his part, Peshkam accepts the 50-million-user threshold as a necessary metric, but not a sufficient one. As he explained:

“In my view this number, while a useful indicator, is not sufficient to declare Blockchain is in the mainstream.”

“The missing piece before mass adoption of Blockchain can happen is a simple app with clear value proposition.”

Are numbers even useful?

In fact, none of the cognoscenti to whom Cointelegraph posed this question answered with a numeric threshold alone. Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, provided a one line answer: Mass adoption has arrived when “crypto is the financial system for the Internet.”

According to a Blockchain.com blog that expands on this point, the circumstance might look (schematically) something like this:

(Blockchain.com)

But it still begs our question, because how will we actually know when crypto becomes the financial system for the internet? The blog describes Blockchain.com’s goal of reaching 1 billion on-chain crypto wallets by 2030. Presumably, that would indicate mainstream acceptance — but for that to happen, the company concedes, crypto will need to be easier to use, more transaction friendly, and less costly (i.e., lower fees).

Do traditional metrics apply?

Michel Rauchs, the head of Paradigma — a consulting firm focusing on the digital assets sector — as well as a research affiliate and former lead for the cryptocurrency and blockchain research program at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge, told Cointelegraph that traditional metrics for software are only of limited utility.

“For instance, the number of developers or total software downloads doesn’t provide information about the actual impact of the technology. It’s a bit like trying to assess the value of COBOL by merely looking at the number of active developers: it’s still the predominant programming language underpinning much of core banking systems that process trillions of dollars in value, yet there is an acute shortage of developers on the market that are familiar with the decade-old language.”

That said, some additional metrics that might further inform the question asked, in Rauchs’ view were:

Number of networks deployed (particularly in regard to enterprise distributed ledger technology, or DLT )

Number and size of direct network participants. Are these small companies or large conglomerates with a global footprint and user base? “Onboarding a large multinational opens up the technology to potentially millions of indirect beneficiaries,” according to Rauchs

Network value: total value transferred (if applicable), total cost savings, new revenue generation, etc. — “Are we talking about millions or billions of dollars?”

Availability: Is it natively integrated into major enterprise IT stacks? “We can already see increasing support from major cloud providers for the top-5 enterprise DLT protocols.” said Rauchs.

With regard to cryptocurrency — a sector within the blockchain technology universe — Vili Lehdonvirta, Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, told Cointelegraph Magazine: “Relative market size doesn’t matter; what matters is the absolute size of the ‘currency area,’ or the set of goods and services that can be purchased with the currency.”

Lehdonvirta is skeptical with respect to Bitcoin, which many think will be the first blockchain technology case to achieve mass adoption, because the crypto community seems willing to move the goalposts to suit its purposes. “When merchants started dropping Bitcoin, enthusiasts changed to other — questionable — definitions of success,” he told us. For example, many now view Bitcoin as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange — which invites different adoption metrics.

A problem must be solved

Geoffrey Moore is author of the book Crossing the Chasm, which builds on the work of Everett Rogers, who first described the five stages through which a technology becomes “diffused” — i.e., goes mainstream: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. In his book, Moore describes a critical “chasm” that all technologies must cross between the “early adopters” and “early majority” stages if they are ever to achieve mass adoption. He told us:

“Bitcoin [i.e., the most prominent instance of blockchain technology] is still in the early market before the chasm. That is, it attracts customers who ‘believe what we believe.’ But the mainstream market is more skeptical.”

To navigate the chasm, Moore continued, the technology needs to target a market segment of pragmatic customers “who are struggling with an intractable problem that cannot be solved by conventional means.” That use case has yet to emerge, in Moore’s view. With regard to Bitcoin, at least, “valuations are still based on the skewed feedback from an enthusiastic cohort that are focused wholly on the upside.”

Peshkam agrees. Blockchain is here to stay, but it still needs a clear application with tangible benefits for its mass adoption by the public — which he predicts “we are going to see by 2025.” Key areas will be business-to-business supply chain product data, digital wallets for B2B and business-to-consumer transactions/daily shopping as well as blockchain-based health records and personal assets like family trust items and deeds.

Simplicity and ease of use also matter

Campbell Harvey, professor of international business at Duke University, told Cointelegraph Magazine: “Blockchain will be mainstream when people don’t even know they are using the technology.”

Usability will be critical. With the Internet, one recalls, easy-to-use browsers (e.g., Mosaic, Netscape Navigator), were a key innovation leading up to widespread adoption:

“The growth of easy-to-use Web browsers coincided with the growth of the commercial ISP business, with companies like Compuserve bringing increasing numbers of people from outside the scientific community on to the Web – and that was the start of the Web we know today.”

Two main problems are preventing large scale adoption at present, Harvey recounted: scaling and the oracle quandary.

“The main blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, simply do not have the capability in terms of transactions per second (TPS). Visa can do 24,000 TPS while Bitcoin can do about 5 and Ethereum 10. To realize the blockchain dream, even 24,000 TPS is not good enough.”

As for the oracle problem, if blockchain is to succeed, it is necessary to collect information from trusted sources outside of the network, such as a price feed. “This is a challenging problem where a ‘trustless’ blockchain technology needs to trust third-party data,” said Harvey.

Who’s talking now?

One way we may know that blockchain has gone mainstream is when people stop talking about it. As Allen Lee, founder and chief architect at QLC Chain told Zage in a 2019 report:

“I personally believe that the day when blockchain technology is used in day-to-day life is the day when people stopped talking about blockchain. Because it is just a backend technology that consumers don’t need to know about.”

Along these lines, Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told Cointelegraph Magazine:

“We will know blockchain has gone mainstream when articles about blockchain-based systems no longer feel the need to highlight the use of distributed ledger technology. No one finds it interesting or surprising today that an application stores data in the cloud, for example.”

Werbach also stressed the need for further regulation, particularly in the case of cryptocurrency. [Werbach, like others, prefers to distinguish between cryptocurrencies and enterprise blockchain.] “We will know cryptocurrency has gone mainstream when [unregulated stablecoin] Tether is no longer a significant source of liquidity for Bitcoin,” he told us. “Crypto will not be mainstream as a financial instrument until it operates within the boundaries of global regulation. Tether’s continued prominence is the best indicator that is not yet the case.”

Waiting for Armageddon

A sizable faction within the cryptoverse views blockchain as a savior technology, one that won’t truly kick in until the current financial system collapses, as it inevitably must under the weight of unsustainable fiat-currency manipulations. “Blockchain doesn’t go mainstream until things in the real world break,” Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Civic Inc., told Cointelegraph Magazine, because otherwise blockchain is just too much trouble — it’s expensive, not particularly user friendly or intuitive, and it has a steep learning curve. “It’s easier to give my money to a bank,” as long as the status quo prevails. The real world economic order has to break in some manner, and then blockchain can ride to the rescue.

Is COVID-19 the sort of global crisis that could catapult blockchain into the mainstream? “COVID-19 is definitely collapsing parts of the economy,” Lingham answered. It behooves blockchain firms working in these areas to apply their experience and learning to find new solutions, he said.

In the wake of the pandemic, medical records is one area where governments are going to be “extremely paranoid,” suggested Lingham. How can health authorities be really sure that an individual has been vaccinated against COVID-19 and won’t infect dozens of others at a football game, say? Vaccination documents can be faked, but that risk diminishes if vaccinations are certified on a tamper-free blockchain.

Diversity matters too

What about demographics — do those need to be right as well? The history of Internet adoption is instructive. At one point in the 1990s, the average Internet user “was a young professional man with an above-average income.” The internet was still a niche technology, arguably.

It eventually became more inclusive. By 1999, reported e-Commerce Times: “The education level of the user is on par with the general population, as is the income level of today’s user. Older Americans are logging on as well.”

For blockchain technology, would 50% usage by the high-income professional males qualify as “mass adoption” — or do the demographics have to be broader as with the Internet at the end of the 1990s?

Tracking adoption is made more difficult by the vagueness and sometime confusion of the term “blockchain technology.” As Lehdonvirta told Cointelegraph Magazine:

“The problem with measuring ‘blockchain adoption’ is that there is no definition of what ‘blockchain’ actually means, so it could be anything.” Companies like IBM and Microsoft use the term ‘blockchain’ to sell distributed databases, while companies like Guardtime have retroactively branded pre-Bitcoin data integrity products as ‘blockchain.’” Continued Lehdonvirta:

“If all that you need to have to call your system blockchain is a hash chain somewhere under the hood, then most of the world’s major companies probably already use ‘blockchain,’ and it was already mainstream before Bitcoin was even invented.”

‘No magic number’

All in all, we appear to have a problem knowing when blockchain goes mainstream because it is a back-end technology used by many governmental, health, and educational sectors as well as businesses and consumers. As Rauchs told us:

“There is no magic number or threshold that will determine the mainstream adoption of “blockchain,” simply because it’s an industry-agnostic general-purpose information system technology with a wide range of applications in many distinct domains.

At a minimum, it must solve some widespread problem before it will be recognized as mainstream, and with regard to Bitcoin, it has to be more than just a speculative tool. “It has to win adoption as a means of payment for real goods and services, not just for use in crypto speculation,” said Lehdonvirta.

For a significant use case to emerge, however, more technical progress may also be needed. “I am most concerned about the scaling problem,” Duke University’s Harvey told us, “There has been very limited progress.” This has led corporations to implement so-called “permissioned” or even “private” blockchains to achieve higher TPS. These, in turn, erase one of the wonders of this new technology — its trustless aspect, Harvey told us. But once blockchain technology creates a consequential societal enhancement — along the lines of what email did for human communication — then we should know it, even if we can’t quite quantify it.

Over $50 billion in cryptocurrency flowed out of China over the past 12 months amid trade wars, a new study finds. East Asia is the world’s largest cryptocurrency market; its crypto trading volume is driven by “a robust professional market” as well as an “extremely active” retail market.

The World’s Largest Crypto Market

East Asia is the world’s largest cryptocurrency market, a new report from blockchain data analytics firm Chainalysis shows. The region, which includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea, and Taiwan, accounted for about 31% of all cryptocurrency transacted in the last 12 months.

In an excerpt from its upcoming 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency report, Chainalysis explained that more cryptocurrency was sent from East Asia than other regions to foreign addresses. “Over $50 billion traveled from East Asia addresses to addresses in other regions, compared to just over $38 billion for Western Europe, the region next in terms of value sent out of the region,” the firm revealed.

Most of the cryptocurrency outflow was from China, Chainalysis added, noting that the Chinese government only allows citizens to move an equivalent of $50,000 at the most out of the country each year. Wealthy Chinese have found some ways to circumvent the restrictions, such as via real estate and shell companies, but the authorities have been cracking down on these methods. “Cryptocurrency could be picking up some of the slack,” the firm noted, elaborating:

Over the last twelve months, with China’s economy suffering due to trade wars and devaluation of the yuan at different points, we’ve seen over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from China-based addresses to overseas addresses.

“We can think of $50 billion as the absolute ceiling for capital flight via cryptocurrency from East Asia to other regions,” the firm suggested.

Relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated to all-time lows in recent weeks as the two countries spar over issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang.

East Asia’s cryptocurrency trading volume is driven by “a robust professional market” and an “extremely active” retail market, Chainalysis highlighted. Roughly 90% of all crypto volume transferred from the region in any given month is “professional-sized,” meaning transactions are worth more than $10,000, the firm continued. Professional crypto investors in the East Asian market also appear to trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies frequently for speculation, unlike in North America, where professional traders focus more on bitcoin and hold for longer. “The liquidity of the East Asia market also makes it the closest we have to a self-sustaining market,” the firm remarked.

Stablecoins, particularly tether (USDT), are heavily traded in East Asia, accounting for up to 33% of all value transacted on-chain. “Tether is by far the most popular stablecoin in East Asia, making up 93% of all stablecoin value transferred by addresses in the region,” Chainalysis wrote.

Chainalysis emphasized that with China controlling about 65% of Bitcoin’s global hashrate, Chinese mining and capital flight have substantially contributed to East Asia’s trading volume, asserting:

East Asia-based addresses have received $107 billion worth of cryptocurrency in the last 12 months, which is 77% more than Western Europe, the second-highest receiving region.

Although East Asia remains the world’s largest cryptocurrency market by a wide margin, its share of the overall crypto activity has been declining since October last year, Chainalysis further noted.

Brazilian crypto companies have signed a code of self-regulation that aims to legitimize and to boost adoption of crypto assets in the country. The document was signed under the auspices of Abcripto, the country’s association of cryptocurrency companies.

According to regional media reports, Brazilian firms that specialize in cryptocurrency custody services, brokerage services, and exchanges “will now have to incorporate measures to prevent crime and money laundering on their platforms.”

The country’s prominent cryptocurrency firms that signed the code include Foxbit, Ripio, Bitcoin Market, and Novadax. The association members say they are targetting a $100 billion cryptocurrency market by end of 2020.

According to Abcripto officials, who see the agreement as a significant milestone, “these exchange platforms account for up to 80% of the volume of cryptocurrency transactions in Brazil.”

The signing ceremony was broadcast live and the code will be “registered on a private platform based on blockchain created by Growthtech.” Growth Tech develops distributed ledger solutions for the notarial and real estate market and is backed by IBM cloud services.

The objective of the agreement is to establish operational practices and compliance standards that all members must adhere to.

Speaking after the signing, the executive director of Abcripto, Safiri Felix, says this is an important step for the fast-growing market. According to Felix, Brazil’s cryptocurrency market has grown by double-digit figures in each of the last three years.

Despite the phenomenal growth, “this ecosystem continues to face the regulatory vacuum, as four possible bills for cryptocurrencies are still being discussed in the nation’s congress.”

Explaining the objectives of the code, Felix says the “main goal of this self-regulation is to protect users ‘without impeding the free initiative’ of companies.” Abcripto members also committing to fight the negative perception cryptocurrencies in the country.

The code also attempts to align the Brazilian crypto market with global standards as it requires “all platforms to apply the basic requirements of know-your-customer (KYC).”

Furthermore, “members must increase their security parameters, strengthen their legal infrastructure, commit to respect free-market principles, and to respect users’ privacy.” The code also seeks to penalize members that fail to comply with these regulations.

For more than a year, representatives from the crypto market say “they have been investigating cases of self-regulation at the international level in order to adapt it to the Brazilian ecosystem.”

Still, Felix believes that “at some point, the Brazilian government will issue a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency companies.”

Shortly after the self-regulation code was signed, media reports surfaced suggesting that the Brazilian legislature is proposing another law that seeks to regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in that country.

The reports say under the law proposed by Brazilian Senator Soraya Thronicke, Brazil wants the central bank and the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, Felix reveals that the global pandemic, Covid-19 might have played a part in forcing Abcripto to hasten the move to self regulate.

“This health phenomenon has triggered the use of financial technologies worldwide including transactions based on bitcoin,” Felix explains.

The executive director adds that “this could be the opportune moment for the more than 30 Brazilian crypto exchanges to adopt protection measures for their users.”

Bitcoin (BTC) is up 35% since Memorial Day, and 133% since March 15, the date when widespread U.S. closures of schools and businesses began. That has helped bitcoin rebound to 64% up for the year so far, after crashing in March along with stocks. That’s better than double the gains of the Nasdaq, which is up 26% for the year. The S&P 500 is up only 5% for the year, and the Dow is still negative (down 1.2%) in 2020. Bitcoin was around $6,500 on March 24. Five months later, it’s near $12,000.

The gains by so-called “altcoins” have been even more impressive—or alarming. Ether (ETH), the token of the Ethereum network and the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 210% in 2020. Stellar Lumens (XLM), token of the Stellar network, is up 130%. Cardano (ADA) is up 274%. Algorand (ALGO) is up 200%. Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme-based cryptocurrency with no business purpose, is up 68%.

You’d be excused for not having heard of many of those tokens, even if you follow bitcoin prices. Some crypto onlookers fear that the huge gains for no-name coins signal another risky bubble akin to 2017. Coin Telegraph is calling this summer a new “altseason.” CoinDesk on Monday called it an “anything-goes token market.”

Andy Bromberg, president of Coinlist, which vets and lists new token sales, sees glimmers of 2017, but thinks this period might be different. Near, a new token that offered its initial sale through Coinlist, had so much demand it crashed the site.

“There’s some great stuff happening, and things that are compelling and have legitimate long term promise, but also there are a lot of people who just see an opportunity to grab cash,” says Bromberg. “Just like in 2017, it’s really hard to vet these things. Some are obviously idiotic. The noise comes along with the signal. So as an investor in the space, you should be cautious, because the more good things that come out, the more scammy things come out too. But you should also be excited.”

Now to the obvious question: Is the rise in crypto prices thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cryptocurrency investors are saying yes—in part. Most of them point to the actions of the Federal Reserve, and of other central banks globally, as fuel for the appeal of bitcoin as a hedge. (Gold, a more mainstream hedge, is up 29% in 2020.)

“There’s so many uncertainties in this pandemic, but one thing that seems almost assured is when you print trillions of dollars more paper money, it’s going to drive up bitcoin and other cyptocurrencies,” says Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital. “Gold’s going to go up, bitcoin’s going to go up. It is a hedge to paper currency being debased.”

Pantera’s digital asset fund is up 130% in 2020, and Morehead believes that in the next year, “The non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies will outperform bitcoin.”

In the same spirit, Pantera still believes in ICOs (initial coin offerings), the token sales that exploded in 2017, then shrunk after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 made clear it saw most ICOs as unregistered securities offerings. “We have a fund that invests in pre-auction ICOs, and instead of seeing 50 white papers a week like we were doing at the peak in 2017, we invest in one or two every quarter. So the market is still there, it’s just much more selective.”

It also helps bitcoin when mainstream Wall Street names voice public support. In May, Paul Tudor Jones surprised skeptics when he said that he sees bitcoin as “a great speculation” and has moved 2% of his hedge fund’s money into bitcoin. That stands in direct contrast to Warren Buffett’s staunch view of bitcoin speculation: “That is not investing.”

Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian: We are entering a 'crypto spring'",,https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/irs-2020-draft-form-1040-puts-crypto-question-front-and-center,"The IRS has released the 2020 draft Form 1040, and it includes the question about whether a taxpayer invested in cryptocurrency or not near the top of the first page. This question first appeared for the 2019 tax year.

The wording of the question, “At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency,” remains the same, save the year.



Cryptocurrency is currently taxed as property. Taxpayers are required to report any transactions involving virtual currency as U.S. dollars on their tax returns, and to do so, they need to determine its fair market value as of its transaction date. This has created opportunity for accounting firms nationwide to start offering cryptocurrency tax services, and indeed many medium to large firms already started offering crypto services before the IRS added the question to 1040 forms.

There are also tech companies offering solutions to help accurately report cryptocurrency investments, like Cointracking, Cointracker, Koinly and Accointing.

Cryptocurrency is not as stable as fiat currency. But actions such as taxation and regulation are part of the landscape that crypto enthusiasts believe will help its legitimacy and stability.

Leading cryptocurrency exchanges are bullish about Africa’s growth prospects as evidenced by their ongoing forays into the continent. During the month of August, Kucoin crypto exchange announced the addition of Nigeria’s naira currency as a payment option on its peer-to-peer platform. Similarly, Binance added Kenya’s popular mobile money service Mpesa to its peer-to-peer platform in the past week, some five months after adding the naira option.

Paxful, which has had success on the continent, already supports multiple payment options. Local.Bitcoin.com, the bitcoin cash peer-to-peer exchange which uses a blind escrow, similarly supports multiple payment options.

In the meantime, Kucoin and Binance are reportedly planning to add more African currency payment options as they look to expand their foothold on the continent. From the few examples mentioned above, it appears that peer-to-peer crypto trading is now the favored approach by major exchanges seeking to tap into the African market.

On the surface, many countries on the continent appear to be primed for mass crypto adoption but that has not happened because there are no fiat on-ramps. Ideally, such on-ramps are necessary as they help potential users of digital assets to switch from fiat to crypto seamlessly. The absence of such on-ramps has had the effect of dissuading interested users from buying. This ultimately slows the adoption of digital assets as well as the growth of the space.

Some observers believe peer-to-peer crypto trading provides the breakthrough crypto exchange platforms have been searching for. News.Bitcoin.com spoke to one observer who shares this view, Elisha Owusu Akyaw, an influencer and cryptocurrency researcher at Blocknewsafrica.

Akyaw, who keeps track of weekly peer-to-peer trading volume trends, says African cryptocurrency users have always wanted fiat on-ramps.

Commenting on reports that leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Kucoin and Binance, added local currency to payment options, Akyaw said:

It shows how much there is a demand for fiat-on ramps from African users, and platforms are (now) willing to provide that.

Also weighing in is Roselyne Wanjiru, Kenyan economist and Director at Pesabase, who says the addition of Mpesa as a payment option truly opens up liquidity options for traders.

She adds: “One of the key challenges of crypto trading in Africa is that of access to quick and easy ways to deposit and withdraw cash in a bid to exchange it for cryptocurrencies.”

Wanjiru asserts that the addition of Kenya’s popular mobile money as a payment option by the major exchange means more people will have the opportunity to participate in digital asset trading.

Meanwhile, Akyaw also believes that “peer-to-peer trading will continue to be the go-to option for users and platforms due to the uncertain regulatory environment (that prevails in many countries).”

Regulatory uncertainty has been central in constraining the growth of the crypto market on the African continent. Some countries have purportedly banned cryptocurrency trading while others have decreed that financial institutions cannot interface with crypto platforms. It appears, however, that this is not a major concern for peer-to-peer trading platforms, especially when looking at the growing number of such platforms.

Still, Akyaw weighs in with another possible reason why more peer-to-peer platforms will be good for Africa.

“Recent additions to the P2P ecosystem in Africa have the potential to improve crypto knowledge levels. For a continent plagued by crypto scams, education will be vital for growth and adoption. Based on precedence, most of the top P2P platforms contribute to education efforts which in turn attracts more people to the crypto space,” said Akyaw.

Paxful is one of the peer-to-peer platforms that are actively involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain education on the continent.

Finally, Akyaw believes the growing competition between exchange platforms will also benefit traders in the form of much wider payment options and lower fee structures. This, in turn, will boost the adoption momentum.

With India’s Supreme Court lifting the virtual banking ban on cryptocurrencies in March this year, global investors seem keen to enter the crypto market in India with investments in local exchange platform. Indian cryptocurrency exchanges have also witnessed a spike in trading volume ever since the SC quashed the 2018 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular which had introduced a banking ban on cryptocurrency in India, calling it unconstitutional.

Since the SC order, there has been a spurt in cryptocurrency-related activities in India, with some crypto exchange platforms reporting a 400% spike in trading activity. According to UsefulTulips.org, the combined monthly trading volume between the Indian Rupee and Bitcoin has nearly doubled between March and July on two foreign crypto exchanges, LocalBitcoins of Finland and Paxful of the US. Their total volume in March was $8.14 Mn. By July the figure had reached $16.26 Mn.

In fact, Inc42’s Cryptocurrency Roundup from last week highlighted how Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange aggregator, CoinDCX, had seen a 62% month-on-month (MoM) growth in trading volume for its product Insta, since the SC order. CoinDCX’s Insta, launched on August 15, 2018, is a fiat-crypto exchange product that lets investors trade in INR.

Users can purchase 100+ cryptocurrencies at competitive prices with close to zero deposit and withdrawal fees. Also, the company said that coins on Insta are protected through CoinDCX’s best-in-class security measures. Moreover, other crypto exchange platforms like WazirX, Unocoin, Bitbns, Cashaa, Oropocket among others have also witnessed a surge in users and transactions after the Supreme Court verdict.

According to CoinMarketCap, Mumbai-based crypto exchange platforms, CoinDCX and WazirX, are seeing monthly trading volumes of $8 Mn and $12 Mn respectively. While it stands pale in comparison to the trading volumes for crypto exchange platforms in the West, the signs of what could be a big market for crypto trading in the near future are visible.

Global investors are also bullish about the same. CoinDCX attracted investments worth $5.5 Mn in two rounds, from a number of global investors including Bain Capital of the US, in March and May after the favourable court ruling. The world’s largest crypto exchange network, Binance of Malta, acquired WazirX last November, perhaps anticipating India’s ban on cryptocurrency trading would be lifted soon.

While Indian legislators are said to be conducting inter-ministerial consultations on a draft law that proposes a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies in India, the stance of Indian IT and tech firms could be a deterrent. In the immediate aftermath of the SC ruling quashing the banking ban on cryptocurrencies, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) said that banning technology was not a solution. India’s biggest IT company firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is also seen to be a firm backer of cryptocurrencies. Last month, the company launched a crypto trading platform called Quartz Smart Solution for banks and investments, in collaboration with blockchain startup Quartz, incubated by TCS.

However, with Indian lawmakers concerned about crypto’s links with terror financing, findings also backed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — a global watchdog to curb money laundering — it remains to be seen if cryptocurrency will flourish in India, or whether the current spurt in growth is nothing but a false dawn.

In other news, at the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $11,767, a decline of 4% from last week, when it was trading at $12,278. The market cap of Bitcoin, at the time of writing, was $217 Bn.

Ethereum was trading at $392.12, a fall of 9% from last week’s $430.95. Its market cap was $43.86 Bn.

Cryptocurrency News Of The Week

IMF Publishes Cryptocurrency Explainer

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) tweeted a video on cryptocurrencies this week, explaining its use, benefits such as removing middlemen, lowering costs, and increasing transaction speed. It also warns of what it sees as risks, such as anonymity and volatility. At the time of writing, the video had garnered 689.5K views and had been retweeted 6,700 times. Following the release of the video, many people saw it as an indication of the IMF’s endorsement of cryptocurrencies, even as many governments all over the world are opposed to it. The video ends with, “If we can counter the risks, then this new technology or some variation of it can completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills. And who knows, this could be the next step in the evolution of money.”

China Sees $50 Bn In Cryptocurrencies Outflow

Owing to escalating trade wars with the US this year, as well as other countries, and a devaluation of the yuan, China saw $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from China-based addresses to overseas addresses, a report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has found. The report notes that the East Asia region, which includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea, and Taiwan, accounted for about 31% of all cryptocurrency transacted in the last 12 months. A bulk of these transactions were made from China, where while the government allows citizens to send only $50,000 out of the country every year, wealthier citizens have found ways to circumvent the ban such as investments in shell companies and real estate. With the government cracking down on those methods, cryptocurrency is seen as being used as an alternative.

The Bitcoin Network Now Consumes 7 Nuclear Plants Worth of Power

The Bitcoin mining process sees miners plugin high-voltage machines, that consume electricity as they try to solve complex computational math problems, which are so complex that they can’t be solved by human hands. The process is called bitcoin mining, where if the computer is able to solve the problem, more bitcoin is added to the blockchain network. Hashrate is used to measure the amount of computing power consumed by the blockchain network.

According to industry estimates, the gigawatts of electrical consumption powering industrial bitcoin mining today consumes as much as seven nuclear power plants.",2020-08-25 14:35:19+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-lending-insight-idUSKBN25M0GP,"LONDON (Reuters) - It sounds like a surefire bet. You lend money to a borrower who puts up collateral that exceeds the size of the loan, and then you earn interest of about 20%. What could possibly go wrong?

FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

That’s the proposition presented by “DeFi”, or decentralised finance, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency platforms that allow lenders and borrowers to transact without the traditional gatekeepers of loans: banks.

And it has exploded during the COVID-19 crisis.

Loans on such platforms have risen more than seven-fold since March to $3.7 billion, according to industry site DeFi Pulse, as investors hunt returns at a time when central banks across the world have slashed interest rates to prop up economies battered by the pandemic.

Proponents say DeFi sites, which run on open-source code with algorithms that set rates in real-time based on supply and demand, represent the future of financial services, providing a cheaper, more efficient and accessible way for people and companies to access and offer credit.

But with the promise of high rewards comes high risk.

Lawyers and analysts say such sites are vulnerable to coding bugs and hacks, and most are untested at scale and unregulated - the latter typical of much of a global cryptocurrency sector mistrustful of the financial establishment.

Critics warn the technology could be the next overblown bubble of the crypto world, akin to initial coin offerings (ICOs), with inexperienced investors at particular risk. In 2017, billions of dollars poured into ICOs, where companies raised capital by issuing new virtual coins. Most projects failed to gain traction, and many investors lost their money.

“These are experiments in finance,” said Preston Byrne of law firm Anderson Kill in New York. “They’re not necessarily legally compliant in a lot of cases,” he added. “But that doesn’t mean that they can’t be at some future.”

DeFi is nonetheless surging in popularity.

Seven years ago, Brice Berdah dreamt of retiring in his mid-30s. He worked out what he would need to save: “The exact amount was 1.7 million euros. My plan was to make 5% on my capital.”

Reality, though, scuppered his plans. Low interest rates meant his savings stagnated, while enquiries into real estate and car-parking businesses came to naught.

“By 27, I had only saved only about 0.5% of the required amount,” said Berdah, who works at a startup that makes digital wallets for storing digital coins. “It was an obvious failure.”

To resurrect his dream Berdah, now 28, has turned to DeFi.

“Now I’m using DeFi, I’ve readjusted my retirement plans,” said Paris-based Berdah, who has bet 90% of his net worth on DeFi. “Returns are about 20-25% over the last six months ... and I’m on track just now.”

INTO THE ETHEREUM

While DeFi’s roots are in a crypto sector hostile to mainstream finance, some of its aims - like cutting costly steps and paperwork in financing - have caught the attention of the firms it seeks to undermine.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

In the future, backers say, bonds or stocks will be issued and traded directly on their blockchain-based platforms instead of by investment banks or centralised exchanges. Code, not humans, will oversee the processes, they say.

For their part, major banks are looking at how such technology can be used to complement, rather than upend, established finance. Goldman Sachs, for example, has hired a new head of digital assets to look at how assets can exist on blockchain technology, a spokesman said earlier this month.

“There is an actual value on what is being built on these protocols,” said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant and board member of an Israeli blockchain industry group. “It might end up being an instant financialisation ecosystem for any project. That’s the promise.”

Most DeFi platforms are based on the ethereum blockchain, the backbone for ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. Unlike bitcoin, ethereum’s blockchain can be used to create digital contracts, while developers can more easily build new software or apps on it.

Loans are recorded, issued and managed by the blockchain-based contracts. Borrowers must offer collateral, also in cryptocurrency, usually worth more than the loans they take out.

DeFi is not for the faint-hearted. Borrowers are typically traders who take out loans in say, ethereum, then use the coins to trade on various exchanges against other cryptocurrencies. They then aim to pay back the loan and pocket their profits, comparable to short-sellers in stock markets.

One such borrower is Antoine Mouran, a computer science student at university in Lausanne.

Mouran borrows the USD Coin cryptocurrency on lending platform Aave, and then uses the loan to trade Lend coins.

The profits on a typical trade? Depending on the starting price, they can reach 30%, Mouran said.

“My portfolio is a couple of thousands dollars,” the 18-year-old added. “I trade for fun, to discover new technologies such as decentralised finance.”

For a graphic on Boomtime for crypto lending:

‘CODE IS NOT LAW’

Aave has been a big beneficiary of the recent DeFi boom, with its loans sky-rocketing by nearly 7,000% since June to $1.4 billion, the DeFi Pulse data shows.

Stani Kulechov, founder of the platform, said user interest had been “enormous” in recent months - but he acknowledges the pitfalls of the fledgling lending industry.

Kulechov said the code that underpinned DeFi lending was capable of regulating itself without the need for oversight by centralised bodies like financial regulators - but only as long as it worked correctly.

“The problem is when smart contracts behave in a way that they shouldn’t, and when things go wrong.”

However failures in code - from bugs to hacks - are common.

On Mar. 12, for example, major DeFi lending platform Maker, with about $1.4 billion of loans, was rocked by a sudden drop in the price of ethereum.

Around 1,200 lenders saw their positions suddenly liquidated for virtually nothing, despite safeguards put in place by Maker to protect lenders against sudden market falls.

Some industry players, like Aave’s Kulechov, advocate self-regulation by platforms to create standards for smart contracts, aiming to prevent hacks or malfunctioning code.

The DeFi industry is still far from that point, though.

Many purists are opposed to any oversight by humans or institutions, preferring to put faith in communities of users improving smart contracts, ironing out bugs through open-source programming.

More immediately, some users are turning to a more traditional industry for a degree of protection from DeFi platform failures: insurance. Some firms, such as London-based Nexus Mutual, offer coverage specifically against failures in smart contracts.

Britain’s financial watchdog told Reuters it regulated some crypto-related activities, looking at them on a case-by-case basis. Even “decentralised” platforms may be subject to regulation, it said separately last year. U.S. securities regulators did not respond to requests for comment.

Until regulation catches up, critics say, the risks of relying on the code may outweigh rewards.

“The people that lose out have no recourse,” said Tim Swanson of blockchain payments firm Clearmatics.

Once your grandparents start asking you what Bitcoin is, you know it’s become pretty popular. And while Bitcoin certainly has plenty of upsides, many people are wondering how they can invest in other cryptocurrencies to get ahead of the curve and possibly become rich. Or at the very least, people are curious as to how they can diversify their financial portfolios with a bit of crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin. And in either case, you have plenty of options to wade through.

Why Cryptocurrency?

We’ll assume you’re already fairly familiar with the basics of cryptocurrency, what it is, and how it works, so we won’t go into a ton of detail here. But in order to increase your chances of making a smart investment, it is helpful to remember why we invest in crypto.

Decentralized. Cryptocurrencies exist independent of any world governments. This makes it a healthy hedge against inflation-prone currencies like the U.S. dollar.

Private. While all transactions are recorded in an immutable ledger on the blockchain, cryptocurrency is incredibly private. The identity of the sender and receiver are obscured and replaced by long, unique codes. Only cash provides this same level of anonymity.

Scarce. As you know, cryptocurrencies have a finite supply. And it’s this fixed supply that gives it similar characteristics to precious metals like gold and silver. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or British Pound, which can be printed off at will, digital currencies will see supply remain steady (while demand inevitably increases).

Versatile. There’s so much you can do with crypto. You can buy and hold long-term, you can day trade, or you can even use it as your bank account to buy and spend.

Keeping these advantages in the back of your mind, you can perform a smart and intentional search, as well as more thorough due diligence.

How to Analyze and Vet the Options

Cryptocurrency prices are driven by multiple levers. Factors like media attention, the prospect of regulation, political developments, large scale economic volatility, differences in the underlying tech development of the token/coin and even idiosyncrasies within individual coins can cause prices to shoot up, drop down, and bounce around.

As you consider Bitcoin alternatives, here are some different factors to analyze:

1. Price

Price is less of a factor than you may think, but it’s still something to consider.

Almost every exchange allows you to buy fractional shares of a cryptocurrency. So if Bitcoin is hypothetically at $10,000, you could buy one-tenth of a Bitcoin for $1,000. But you could use that same $1,000 to buy hundreds or thousands of full coins of other cryptocurrencies that are priced below a dollar. It all depends on how much you want to diversify.

2. Prospects

What are the prospects for a particular coin? In other words, what are the experts saying? Listen to sources, read as much information as you can, and learn to evaluate financials and other signs. You want to invest in coins that have their best days ahead, not ones that are fizzling out.

3. Supply

As mentioned, most cryptos have a predetermined supply. Once that maximum is reached, no new tokens will ever be produced. Assuming demand increases over time, this paves the way for some serious appreciation. Make sure you understand the supply of any coin you’re investing in – it’ll give you a clearer picture of the future trajectory.

4. Risk Level

Regardless of whether you’re investing in stocks, real estate, or cryptocurrency, you need to understand your risk level. How much are you willing to lose? And how much can you stomach losses in order to potentially enjoy some gains?

Bitcoin is by far the safest bet right now - simply based on its volume, backing, age, and media exposure - but there are other well-known coins that are relatively stable, too. Options like Etherum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) are popular.

5. ICO Offerings

Much like companies on traditional stock exchanges, new cryptocurrency companies tend to introduce their coins to the marketplace via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This is your chance to get in on the ground floor. But it’s also the riskiest time to invest.

If you feel confident in your ability to scout out opportunities and understand what sets good companies apart, ICOs can prove to be lucrative. Just make sure you’re also diversifying with more established coins, too.

Be Smart and Calculated

While there are some who disagree, all cryptocurrencies are speculative at this point - especially outside of Bitcoin. So it’s important to be smart and calculated in your decision making. Talk to a variety of sources, gather opinions, and remember to diversify (both inside and outside of crypto). There’s so much opportunity, you just have to learn when and where to call your shots.

Katie Stockton, analyst at Fairlead Strategies, sees $10,000 as a lower bound in trading because the world’s oldest cryptocurrency lacks market momentum. “The pullback in bitcoin appears healthy,” Stockton noted. “That said, there is room for further near-term downside with support in the $10,000-$10,055 area, where there was once resistance, and room to short-term oversold territory.”

Jean Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, says bitcoin continues to be affected by gains in alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. Indeed, one way to measure this is looking at bitcoin’s dominance, which hit a 2020 low of 60.26% in August.

”The flattishness of the bitcoin price since the beginning of August allowed the altcoin market cap to grow quickly with an inflow from bitcoin traders toward altcoins,” said Pavageau.

However, two key events looming over the balance of this week might increase bitcoin market action. One is Thursday’s speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “The key thing to watch from Powell’s speech tomorrow is the possible shift of the inflation target from a unique figure, like 2%, to a range such as 1.75%-2.25%,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “This would create a dovish feel to the market and we’d likely see some dollar weakness.”

Another event is the expiration of 65,000 BTC options, over $700 million at current market values, on Friday. The vast majority of these options are on crypto derivatives platform Deribit.

“We may see some volatility as a few traders try to push the futures market towards the $11,000 or $12,000 strike,” said Swissquote’s Thomas, adding, “$11,000 would be a buying opportunity and $12,000 we’d likely see further selling.”

Value locked in DeFi at $7B

Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $386 and climbing 1.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The total value locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has surpassed $7 billion in value, according to aggregator DeFi Pulse. Over 4.8 million ETH and 49,248 BTC is currently “staked” in various DeFi services, gaining a percentage profit or “yield” in return.

Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives platform Alpha5, says DeFi’s opportunities are captivating the interest of traders, and perhaps creating some brand-new ones. “Derivatives traders naturally look for complex risk to exploit, and, by comparison to DeFi, typical derivatives instruments are quieter,” Shah said. “I think the nuanced specifics of DeFi are probably even giving rise to a new breed of derivative traders.”

“A lot of these protocols have a lot of complex intricacies that are quite hard to grasp without doing a significant dive and researching the protocol for weeks (not hours or days),” he said.

That’s a level of attention that some of these projects can’t afford. Their memes die as quickly as they rise.

In what appears to be the beginning of another crypto bull market, a lot of attention is being directed at decentralized finance, or DeFi, and the permissionless financial experiments the ecosystem is driving. These memetic projects, inscrutable or absurd to a general audience, have rekindled a conversation about what crypto wants to be.

Memes are the lingua franca of the internet, performing as shorthand for complex phenomena. In the world of cryptocurrencies, memes hold particular sway. Like crypto, memes were born on the internet and have journeyed from the fringes to the mainstream. They’re used to drive adoption of cryptocurrency, signal bullishness or bearishness on certain assets or coins by traders and even boost the value of tokens. They are a part of the discourse, commemorate events, spur narratives about certain coins and even help people earn millions of dollars.

Memetic beginnings

The term “meme” comes from Richard Dawkins’ 1976 book “The Selfish Gene.” He describes a meme as a behavior or idea that jumps from person to person within a culture.

“We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines,” he wrote, describing the idea that these cultural artifacts are a way to communicate ideas quickly to humans with a limited attention span.

The term, which was not originally intended to describe DeFi or “brr” money printers, was appropriated to describe cheeky online images. Not that Dawkins minded.

“When anybody talks about something going viral on the internet, that is exactly what a meme is and it looks as though the word has been appropriated for a subset of that,” Dawkins said in a 2013 interview. While memes are often associated with image macros accompanied by black and white text, any idea – be it represented as a .gif, text or video – that goes viral online can rightfully be called a meme, under Dawkins’ definition.

I’ve been really interested in memes in particular because I feel like it's so important for getting crypto to have mainstream adoption and interest.

A less academic eye would probably see memes purely as jokes. Greta Thunberg earned a headline-grabbing reputation after her climate protest went viral; while her activism is memetic, it isn’t a meme. There’s a tension between the meme and how it functions. At once a viral bit of information, memes also create in-groups and out-groups between those who understand. In this sense, memes are a mirror of crypto, a tool for connecting the world that’s partially occluded by its technicality and what is sometimes called crypto’s “toxic community.”

Enter the doge

Linda Xie, former product manager at Coinbase and now founder of the crypto investment fund Scalar Capital, dove deep into the links between memes and crypto after becoming interested in dogecoin, the first parody cryptocurrency to take off in a big way (it recently took off once more following some new TikTok videos).

“I’ve been really interested in memes in particular because I feel like it’s so important for getting crypto to have mainstream adoption and interest,” she said in a phone call. “Just having a really clear meme goes a lot further than people writing some incredibly long blog post.”

The adorable Shiba Inu, Doge, was first posted on a random blog in 2010, given an inner monologue on Tumblr in 2011, used by 4chan hordes to spam Reddit in 2013 and eventually became the namesake of a cryptoproject that same year.

Although the project is an elaborate joke – it’s a fork of Luckycoin, which is a fork of Litecoin, which itself splintered from Bitcoin – it developed a serious community of users. People used it to tip each other for good content, and there was a good faith effort to rebrand as the people’s crypto, as opposed to the “elitist” bitcoin.

“I just liked the congenial atmosphere and the crowdfunding elements (the bobsled team, etc). It was entertaining and I could mine it on my laptop for a while, unlike bitcoin,” Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures and CoinDesk columnist, said over Telegram.

Joke or not, dogecoin now has a $421 million market cap. Xie said this represents how memes can shape reality. Just because you’re laughing doesn’t mean you don’t have skin in the game.

Memes to money

Seven years later, similarly bizarre concepts for crypto projects – some that advertise themselves as useless lines of code – are still able to attract millions of dollars worth of investments. YAM, PASTA and BASED are among the most recent.

To draw attention to the phenomenon, Consensys’ Jordan Lyall has created his own meme-DeFi project.

“Introducing The Degenerator,” he tweeted on Aug. 14. “Spin up a new #DeFi project in as little as 5 minutes!”

The idea pokes fun at the way that comically named DeFi projects like YAM and others were rapidly spinning up value.

The developer’s anti-meme joke took on a life of its own though, particularly when someone minted a meme coin called Degenerator, listed as $MEME on exchanges. Two weeks later, “Degenerator” was dropped, and the coin became just $MEME. It now has a market cap of more than $2 million and is listed on CoinGecko.

Lyall now tells people not to buy it. His warning “don’t buy $MEME” has become a staple in crypto Telegram circles, he said in a phone conversation.

There had already been infighting and a hard fork in the group, but what’s risen to the surface from the community is the launching of an actual protocol in which you stake $MEME for nonfungible tokens (NFT) of art created by meme artists. The project formally launches today.

“It’s a mix of YAM and CryptoKitties,” Lyall said.

Lyall recognizes the whole thing has spiraled out of his control, and at this point he’s just watching to see what happens. Most people probably bought in the LOLs (laugh out loud) rather than the gain, he says.

But sometimes where the LOLs go online, the gains follow.

“I’m just extremely fascinated with how something so dumb, a Twitter joke and graphic that took me half an hour to design, really created $2 million in value in a couple of hours,” he said.

Such projects are self-referential protocols that make light of, while also exemplifying, the “monetary experiments” that decentralized finance (DeFi) enables. Sponsored by “degenerate traders,” they’re as much about making money as having fun, according to CoinDesk’s Will Foxley.

Not every meme-coin is jovial. CoronaCoin, launched in February, was a morbid experiment to tie financial success to death.

“People fixate on the wrapping, but the substance is really an opportunity to make a lot of money gambling,” Carter said. Absurdist on the face, these protocols leverage rock-solid “nakamoto schemes” and zero-sum games to create real financial opportunities, he said.

David Z. Morris, a reporter at Fortune and author of “Bitcoin is Magic: Internet Money, Memetic Warfare, and the End of Mere Reality,” said crypto memes are a window on market sentiment.

“Traders are dealing with short-term sentiment and meta information about how people are thinking right now,” said Morris. “So when you look at an interval of a couple of days at a time, a meme can have a lot of influence, particularly when it crosses over to somewhere like Twitter.”

Message boards

For various reporting projects he’s spent time on forum sites like 4chan and said he’s seen that memes, offhand comments and relatively shallow discourse was particularly dominant among traders. He said that popularity is significant for understanding how memes work.

The movement of memes from 4chan to mainstream sites like Twitter isn’t new. In fact, researchers found that after looking at 160 million memes from Gab, Twitter, 4chan, and Reddit most of them began on 4chan or Reddit, both of which were key platforms for the cryptocurrency community.

So memes not only play a role in making things like dogecoin more popular, but also serve as shorthand communications mechanisms for traders who need to signal something quickly. “You have a bunch of people who are very smart, trying to process information as quickly as possible, and memes are a packaging method that works to do that,” said Morris.

But it’s not just price signals these memes are sending, thinks Demetri Kofinas, host of the Hidden Forces podcast and longtime observer of the industry. There’s a sociological aspect of memes that seem to draw upon traders’ deepest insecurities and desires.

Looking at Wojack, a popular meme frequently depicted as a skinless, suffering and crying man, is often used to represent the “potentially destitute zoomer or millennial who doesn’t buy bitcoin and ends up poor and miserable,” Kofinas said. Whether this meme expresses the anxiety of gambling on bitcoin or failing to is an open question.

Memes are not just part of the story. Memes are integral.

“I’m not an expert,” Kofinas stressed. Then again, no one is when it comes to memes. Though there are people with familiarity in marketing that see memes as a potent way to “brand” crypto.

Channeling his inner Edward Bernays, Kofinas suggested memes are part of the community building process, where a particular brand becomes the domain of those that use it the most. “It happens organically not top down, but bottom up,” he said. “Crypto is the ultimate expression of that, because of the nature of its open source platforms and tech.”

This process was seen recently in the virality and community-driven excitement around the YAM token. The project’s creators likely chose absurd imagery to “attract eyeballs.”

Community building

Memes also function as a form of community building in crypto. Yes, it’s true most people in crypto speak English. But everyone speaks in memes.

As the pandemic ravaged the globe earlier this year, in April, the “Fed blew its bazooka.” Many in the crypto industry didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. A flood of cash meant to buoy a sinking economy, was thought on Crypto Twitter to spur rampant inflation, and bolster companies that should have prepared for the worst.

The response was practically automatic: In early April, one couldn’t log on without seeing “brrrrrr,” an onomatopoeia supposedly representing the mechanical whir of money printers, mocking the biggest federal stimulus in U.S. history.

It was a meme with cross-over appeal even landing on the vaulted pages of Bloomberg. Any coiner with an r in their name replaced it with many. This is all despite the fact that money printers aren’t actually spinning out new bills. For what it’s worth, “I imagine a brrr is right?!?” Daniel Gorfine, former executive at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said when queried over email if the written-sound is accurate. (The United States Mint did not respond to a request for comment.)

Memes don’t necessarily need to make sense, thinks Peter McGraw, professor of marketing and director of the Humor Research Laboratory (HuRL) at the University of Colorado. “The very same joke some people are laughing at, others are bored by and others are offended,” he said in a phone call. In response to tragedy, humor – whether it lands or not – is often a signal to the world that you’re still alive.

That simplicity of communication is what gives memes their universality. Though it’s what’s being communicated that gives them potency.

“Comedy can reveal what’s wrong with the world,” McGraw said. It’s a particularly strong tool for coming to grips with a world where every new day challenges the definition of the word unprecedented. In mid-April, when it became cheaper to buy a barrel of oil than a bottle of Dasani, it was the tragicomic memes of Twitter that brought us back to reality.

Key Takeaways Crypto exchanges have turned to acquisitions as a means of broadening their businesses.

Each exchange is taking different paths. Coinbase has its eyes on institutional funds while Binance and FTX target individual traders.

If TradFi companies start to build regulated crypto exchanges, they will poach talent from crypto and acquire a swarm of companies for their infrastructure.

Share this article

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been on a spree of acquisitions, helping them widen the scope of products they offer. Exchanges must, however, continue to aggressively expand to preevent powerful financial institutions from joining the exchange race.

Exchanges Dominate Crypto

Large cryptocurrency exchanges have been involved in the biggest mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals over the past few years.

From Binance acquiring CoinMarketCap to FTX’s latest purchase of Blockfolio, CoinMetrics referred to crypto exchanges as the “apex predators” of the space due to their tremendous maturation over a short period of time.

Looking beyond general strategies, each major exchange is taking a different route with the same vision of rapid expansion. Coinbase’s deal for Tagomi, for instance, offers a glimpse into its institutional ambitions, while Binance and FTX’s acquisitions evidence a focus on retail-oriented traders.

Further differentiating, Binance is enticing customers through value-add services like staking and lending. FTX, however, is building innovative trading-centric products like Presidential election markets and a tradeable index of the top Uniswap tokens.

But for all crypto exchanges, there is a common risk of traditional financial companies entering the crypto exchange race, and using their enormous resources to overpower incumbents.

Firms like Fidelity have already started crypto trading desks, and CME is raking in strong interest from institutions. These two trends fail to shed light on events happening behind closed doors or the amount of money these institutions can spend to acquire talent and infrastructure.

Still, leading crypto exchanges have been in the industry for years, and have oodles of specific knowledge that companies like Goldman Sachs or Deutsche Bank lack.

And if Coinbase is able to capture billions of dollars of trading from hedge funds investing in the space, or Binance continues to grow its share of the retail market, they will develop reputations that last for years to come.

This will, at the least, make it more difficult for new entrants to challenge the top platforms.

Wash trading is indeed a major problem within the cryptocurrency trading industry. Earlier, many established exchanges were accused of such malpractices, some to gain profits, while others to boost liquidity.

Months after, another firm claimed that crypto wash trading on a major exchange went down by over 35 percent, however, the problem still persists.",2020-08-26 12:37:08+00:00,https://gcn.com/articles/2020/08/26/ai-bitcoin-miners-supercomputers.aspx,"AI defends supercomputers from bitcoin miners

To ensure scarce high-performance computing resources are only used by authorized applications, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed an artificial intelligence system that can detect malicious codes that hijack supercomputers for illicit applications such as cryptocurrency mining.

Legitimate cryptocurrency miners depend on racks of specialized computers that solve complex computational problems that chain together transactions and receive an portion of the mined cryptocurrency as a reward. Some miners take shortcuts, hijacking high-performing computers at universities or government facilities, taking advantage of their processing power and saving themselves from having to set up their own mining systems. In fact, academic supercomputers across Europe were attacked in May by cryptocurrency miners who exploited compromised credentials to gain remote access to the systems. Once inside, they deployed cryptocurrency-mining malware and moved from one system to another.

Besides the security vulnerabilities introduced by Illicit mining, it also increases a supercomputer’s CPU load, reducing its performance and consuming more power.

The new AI system developed at Los Alamos compares control flow graphs of programs actually running on the system to a catalog of graphs for programs that have permission to run on a given computer. By comparing the contours in a program’s graph to those in the catalog, the system can spot unauthorized programs, even those that miners have disguised look like legitimate programming.

When testing their system by comparing a known, benign code to an abusive, Bitcoin mining code, the researchers found they could identify the illicit mining operation much quicker and more reliably than conventional, non-AI analyses, Los Alamos officials said.

While this graph-based approach may not offer a completely foolproof solution for all scenarios, it will give security researchers another tool prevent cryptocurrency miners from hacking into high-performance computing facilities and stealing precious computing resources.",2020-08-26 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/mathew-dsouza-crypto-obituary,"Mathew J.

Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in an investor note that Thursday’s failed bitcoin rally was a result of the substance, or lack thereof, of Powell’s comments. “Powell’s backpedaling and fuzzy inflation framework has disappointed the market that was hoping for a formalization of inflation policy in this speech itself,” the firm wrote.

The Fed inflation framework, which in Powell’s words is “flexible,” is a positive sign, said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills. “Although the market reacted to Powell’s comments, I have to believe anyone really thinking hard about it knew this was a likely response by him,” said Van Huis. “One in the digital asset space might be smiling even more now, saying ‘this thing we are building might actually be working,’” he added.

The bitcoin market may see more exciting action Friday, when over 66,400 BTC in open interest options are set to expire.

William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, expects volatility to rise as a result. “What large open interest means is that there is more money on the line by institutions and retail with strong financial incentives to move prices to or away from certain prices as we move into that expiration,” he explained.

“The two strikes with the greatest open interest are at $11,000 and $12,000,” said Purdy. He thinks spot prices could further gyrate because buyers of options would have gains minimized inside that $11,000-$12,000 range.

Options traders had a small scare when Deribit, the largest bitcoin options exchange, went offline during early European trading hours. At one point, Deribit warned it was possible it wouldn’t be back online in time to handle the 2,000 or so bitcoin options that were expiring Thursday.

The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture complaint after having in March charged two Chinese nationals with laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency on behalf of North Korea.

Earlier court filings detailed what U.S. authorities have characterized as Pyongyang’s use of hackers to circumvent sanctions.

“Today’s action publicly exposes the ongoing connections between North Korea’s cyber-hacking program and a Chinese cryptocurrency money laundering network,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s criminal division said in a statement.

Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, are created through a computer process called mining, which requires powerful hardware.

Once generated, they can be exchanged on anonymous online platforms for other currencies such as the U.S. dollar, enabling illegal activity such as money laundering and sanctions violations.

The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion for weapons of mass destruction programs using “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, a U.N. report said last year.

The U.N. experts said attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges have allowed North Korea to generate income without the oversight common in traditional banking channels.

One of Wall Street’s fiercest Bitcoin supporters, Fidelity Investments, is launching an institutional-focused Bitcoin fund. As companies and funds turn their attention to Bitcoin, regulated investment vehicles that cater to larger investors are becoming a necessity.

Fidelity’s Bitcoin Takeover

Fidelity‘s latest venture, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Index fund, brings passive Bitcoin investing to family offices, HNIs, hedge funds, and other classes of institutional investors.

Peter Jubber, head of Fidelity Consulting, filed the fund’s creation with the SEC and will take charge of the fund’s business operations.

Sources close to Bloomberg confirmed the fund will be a Bitcoin-only investment vehicle with a minimum investment size of $100,000. Fidelity Digital Assets will custody the fund’s holdings.

Fidelity’s latest push is a result of institutional interest in Bitcoin, which has been rising ever since macro headwinds sunk the global economy.

Last month, a billion-dollar NASDAQ traded company announced the purchase of $250 million of BTC for its company treasury. The company’s conviction in the premier cryptocurrency stems from the current economic climate of low-interest rates and a weakening dollar.

Renown investors like Paul Tudor Jones previously signaled confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects amidst the Fed’s relentless money printing efforts.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to take the stage today at Jackson Hole to double-down on the Fed’s expansionary policies. Investors are worried about the dollar’s future but expect assets like gold, Bitcoin, and even stocks to emerge as the real winners.

As institutions start to notice Bitcoin and its unique investment positioning, companies like Fidelity and Grayscale are setting themselves up to capture this demand.

That’s the main takeaway of a new Latin America report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. On Thursday, the startup revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that Venezuela ranks third in the world for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis metrics, behind Ukraine and Russia.

“The reason why it ranks so highly is the peer-to-peer marketplaces. That’s why Venezuela stood out to us,” Chainalysis research lead Kim Grauer said in an interview.

The new data tells of a society so sick of hyperinflation that citizens are willing to turn to bitcoin (BTC) as a haven, Grauer said. They’re getting their bitcoin from peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins, centers of Venezuela’s burgeoning crypto scene.

Meanwhile, Venezuela’s government-approved exchanges are struggling to gain traction.

Criptolago, an exchange owned by the Venezuelan state of Zulia and one of only seven exchanges with government approval, eked out just $380,000 in dollar-adjusted volume over the last year, according to Chainalysis research.

LocalBitcoins reported $242 million in bolivar-to-bitcoin trading volume over the past 365 days, according to data site UsefulTulips. Over the same period, Paxful posted $311,000 in bolivar-to-bitcoin volume. (Paxful suspended payments with the Bank of Venezuela in June, citing U.S. sanctions.)

On-chain data suggests Criptolago is mostly being used by Venezuela’s elite, according to Chainalysis. The majority of its bitcoin transactions – 75% are over $1,000 – are simply too large for vast swaths of the cash-poor country to afford.

Experts consulted by Chainalysis speculated that the wealthy are using Criptolago to preserve their riches or even evade sanctions. No matter their reasons, usage is increasing: Criptolago’s bitcoin transfer volume in July 2020 was 13 times higher than it was one year ago.

“From what we can identify, most of the activity on Criptolago is really large,” Grauer said. “It’s just those transfers that are driving the [exchange’s] growth overall.”

That a government-approved crypto exchange would not be citizens’ primary choice in a country wracked by hyperinflation and political turmoil was hardly surprising to the regional experts consulted for the Chainalysis report, Grauer said.",2020-08-27 13:20:43+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/authorities-block-russia-s-top-crypto-exchange-aggregator,"BestChange.ru, a major cryptocurrency website in Russia, has got blocked shortly after local lawmakers finally passed the country’s crypto legislation.

An aggregator of about 400 local crypto exchange websites, BestChange.ru website was blocked by Russian telecom regulator Roskomnadzor on Aug. 26.

The website is still available through the use of VPN services as well as mirror websites like BestChange.net, according to a popup announcement on BestChange.ru.

According to an announcement on local social media VK.com, BestChange.ru website was blocked alongside a bunch of other industry sites for “mentions of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.""

According to public court records cited by BestChange, Roskomnadzor blocked BestChange.ru alongside websites like cryptowikipedia.ru and coinpost.ru. According to the data, the websites were “offering to buy electronic currency Bitcoin and certain products using this currency.” As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are prohibited from being used for payment in Russia, the distribution of information about these services by the websites is illegal, the court records note.

A spokesperson for BestChange.ru told Cointelegraph that the website has never provided any information about buying or selling products with Bitcoin. “Our website only provides information on up-to-date exchange rates by exchangers, who, by the way, also do not advertise crypto as a payment method,” they said.

BestChange.ru is apparently one of the largest crypto websites in Russia. According to data from website analytics tool SimilarWeb, BestChange has been steadily growing this year to hit 3.3 million users in July 2020. The website delivers a list of crypto exchange services, in addition to providing verification and ratings for each platform. The service has been operating since 2007.

BestChange.ru website has been blocked multiple times before. As reported by Russian news agency RBC, the website was first blocked back in 2017. The website remained available through the use of services like VPN, the report notes. Roskomnadzor reportedly blocked BestChange.ru again in 2019, arguing that distribution of information about Bitcoin “contradicts Federal laws and is prohibited on the territory of Russia.”

The news comes shortly after Russia finally passed its first legislation related to the cryptocurrency industry. As President Vladimir Putin signed the bill into the law on July 31, payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are going to become illegal on Russia’s territory starting from January 2021.

A representative at BestChange.ru told Cointelegraph that the newly passed law, “On Digital Assets,” has not impacted the platform in terms of visits so far, but could potentially make things more difficult for crypto-related websites in Russia because it prohibits the distribution of information about crypto as a payment method.",,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-oasis-labs-crypto-fraud-hacks-alliance,"Disclosure

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect comments from Coinbit, which denies wrongdoing, placing blame on a few rogue employees, who have since been dismissed. The exchange claims it is still operating normally.

Police in South Korea on Wednesday raided and seized the offices of Coinbit, the country’s third largest crypto exchange, over allegations it faked 99% of its trading volume.

According to a report from Seoul News, local police took control of Coinbit’s headquarters in Gangnam as well as other sites elsewhere.

Police accuse the exchange’s owner Choi Mo and other managers of “wash trading”. For about a year until May 2020, the process earned Coinbit 100 billion won ($84 million) in profit fraudulently, it said.

A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial asset to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. It is illegal in most jurisdictions.

In the case of Coinbit, the exchange was functionally split into two operational accounts containing all user funds, say police. Fraud within the first account involved major cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), ripple (XRP), and tether (USDT), which Coinbit staff moved internally between “ghost accounts”.

The other account exclusively traded dubious altcoins and initial exchange offerings. The firm prevented transactions with outside exchanges so that the owner and management were able to control the supply of coins. Choi and his team allegedly manipulated this structure by trading large quantities of the listed crypto and then dumping them on unsuspecting retail traders.

However, in a statement to news.Bitcoin.com, Coinbit dismissed the allegations as “inappropriate”. The company blamed the illegal trading on “some employees with moral skepticism.” Coinbit said it had known about the illegal activities since last year and had reported the accused workers to the police.

“Coinbit has not committed any illegal acts so far and has not been suspended by this time. Noone, including Coinbit’s chairman, has been indicted or seized by the police on fraud charges,” said the exchange. “This case was a personal crime committed by some employees who had joined the company for their financial interests,” it added.

According to the newspaper report, authorities are also questioning the possibility of additional malpractice and embezzlement. The paper said it examined Coinbit’s books before alerting the police. It held off its report at the police’s request, but its investigations found discrepancies in the deposits and withdrawals of 99% of the trading volumes.

In April, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service refused to sign-off the exchange’s financial statements, which had not been externally audited. Coinbit had 252,000 visitors in the last three months and is only surpassed by Bithumb and Upbit in South Korea. Police investigations are ongoing. As South Korea drafts crypto laws, there is concern that more such seizures could follow.

But the U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives exchange is holding out hope its dormant options platform will eventually gain traction.

Trading volumes for physically settled bitcoin futures on Bakkt rose to $134 million on Tuesday from a previous high of $132 million on July 28, according to crypto derivatives data firm Skew. Bakkt went live last September.

“The market recognizes the value that a regulated physically delivered bitcoin future offers for hedging and risk management and speculation,” White told CoinDesk in a phone interview on Aug. 26.

This has been part of the significant growth in bitcoin’s derivative market as a whole, after the cryptocurrency’s price went above $11,000.

Getting physical with bitcoin

Despite the recent surge on Bakkt’s bitcoin futures trading volumes, it still lags behind the Chicago-based CME Group, a bigger, U.S.-regulated exchange. Data from Skew shows the aggregated daily volumes of bitcoin futures on Bakkt and the CME were at $279 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, on Monday.

Compared with many offshore, unregulated exchanges that have taken the majority of the bitcoin futures market share, White said Bakkt has the advantage of being based in the U.S. and owned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which also owns the New York Stock Exchange.

“We are a fully regulated intermediated traditional futures market. Contrast that with the offshore unregulated markets that you see trading on a lot of crypto exchanges,” he said.

The crypto derivatives provider launched its bitcoin futures contracts in late 2019 with the goal of serving its institutional clients, who range from market makers and proprietary trading firms to family offices and traditional hedge funds, according to White.

At the same time, unlike the CME, Bakkt’s bitcoin futures contracts are mostly settled with physically delivered bitcoin, meaning buyers receive tokens at expiration instead of cash.

Some U.S. institutions are only allowed to trade on regulated exchanges. Thus, if they want to get into crypto, they have two choices: Bakkt or the CME, because exchanges such as Coinbase are licensed but unregulated in the U.S. For those who want to hold their bitcoin in their hands, Bakkt is basically the only game in town.

White said the physical delivery of bitcoin puts Bakkt at advantage because the exchange is seeing more clients interested in receiving crypto assets.

“It’s not a bet on the price of bitcoin,” he said. “It doesn’t rely on an index price created from unregulated spot markets that are self-reporting their data.”

In addition, White said that as the market grows, more traditional institutional investors are becoming “comfortable” with holding and trading crypto assets, which is evidenced by Bakkt’s increasing market share.

However, other industry experts have said physical delivery of bitcoin could be the one factor that has been hindering Bakkt’s growth in the crypto derivatives market.

According to Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, the number of bitcoin contracts held to expiry on Bakkt dropped sharply in July, to 58 BTC from June’s 221 BTC – the lowest amount held to expiry so far in 2020.

Compared with a cash settlement, physical delivery of bitcoin could impose a tighter margin, Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivative exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk via Telegram.

No options, for now

Despite the success with its bitcoin futures products, Bakkt seems to be still struggling with its options contracts. No volume or open interest have been logged since June 15 in Bakkt’s bitcoin options.

Bitcoin Options Open Interest by Exchange Source: Skew

Futures contracts on CME are settled with cash; options contracts settle in futures which in turn get immediately cash settled.

Meanwhile, CME’s bitcoin options contracts contributed about 10% to the total global open interest on Tuesday, second behind Deribit, who accounted for 80% of the market. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts.

White shrugs off concerns about Bakkt’s options products, saying the crypto options market as a whole has a long way to go before it matures.

“When people ask, ‘Aren’t you worried about your options volumes?’ Absolutely not,” White said. “These are the early innings. Most of the options volume is happening offshore, unregulated, not cleared and, frankly, we’re not even sure how much of that volume is legitimate.”

White is banking on growing trading volumes and open interest Bakkt’s futures products to eventually draw customers to its options suite, and is therefore not planning on delisting options contracts anytime soon.

“As the institutions move into the futures, their hedging and risk management needs will evolve towards options, and we are going to be there ready to serve them,” White said.",2020-08-27 20:11:00+00:00

Already live on its foreign exchange trading platform, SBI FX Trade, the contracts come in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP flavors.

The firm said in an announcement Friday that traders can pair the crypto assets with both the U.S. dollar and the yen, meaning there are six CFD choices in total.

Orders can be placed from around 15 yen ($0.14) to a maximum open position of 500 bitcoin ($5.73 million at press time), for the BTC/JPY pair.

SBI Holdings said it also has a mobile app for the CFD trading and orders can be placed around the clock on any day of the week.

Users can make use of leverage â in effect, borrowing from the platform â to make trades.

CFDs are very short-term contracts that pay the difference in price between the open and closing trades.

They are not without controversy and a U.K. financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said it plans to ban these types of derivatives for retail traders.

The FCA said last year that such financial products are âill-suitedâ to retail investors âwho cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain cryptoassets.â

SBI Holdings specifically said in its announcement it will be catering to both beginner and expert traders.

That might be a healthy sign that digital-asset markets are maturing.

At Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, the daily average spread between buy and sell orders on bitcoin futures for $10 million quote size declined to a record low of 0.25% on Monday, according to data provided by research firm Skew. The spread, which typically narrows as an exchange’s order book depth increases, spiked to 7.95% during the March crash but dropped shortly after. It has been in a declining trend ever since.

The so-called bid/offer spread is the difference between the best available price to sell or buy something in a market. It essentially represents liquidity – the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold on a marketplace at stable prices.

A narrower spread implies a deeper market where there is sufficient volume of open orders so buyers and sellers can execute a trade without causing a big change in the price. That’s in contrast to a weak liquidity environment, where large orders tend to move the price, increasing the cost of executing trades, and deterring traders – especially institutions – and, in turn, causing a further decline in liquidity.

Binance and BitMEX offering record low spread on a $10 million quote is a healthy market development, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based crypto prime broker Bequant.

“The tighter the spread, the deeper the order book, the more the market is able to withstand shocks [price volatility],” Vinokourov told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

Bid-offer spreads on bitcoin have been shrinking on Binance, BitMEX and other exchanges. Source: Skew

BitMEX and Binance aren’t alone as other exchanges have also witnessed a steady drop in spreads over the past five months.

Spreads on Deribit and FTX have also declined from March highs, but still remain considerably higher than those on BitMEX and Binance.

Bitcoin’s price rally may be one possible explanation for the exchange-wide decline in spreads.

“Higher liquidity is largely a function of prices being higher,” said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder at GSR, a digital assets trading firm. “At the $12,000 price range, if you have the same amount of tokens on the bid/offer that’s three times as many dollars as $4,000 BTC, resulting in much tighter spreads.”

Spread compressions in several markets

The bid/offer spread on perpetuals (futures without expiry) listed on BitMEX fell to a lifetime low of 0.17% on July 18 and was last seen at 0.25%.

Binance consistently offered a higher spread than BitMEX before the March crash. Since then, however, the spreads have converged and pretty much moved in tandem.

“Bitmex’s lead has reduced over other exchanges, largely due to reputational risk, following a raft of outages and tech issues earlier in the year,” said Vinokourov.

Seychelles-based BitMEX suffered an aggressive DDoS attack on March 13, which delayed and prevented requests to the platform. The outage was widely blamed for bolstering price volatility. It suffered another outage in May, but that did not create panic in the market.

Sign of healthier market

An important driver of order book depth or liquidity is the rate of change in prices. In times of extreme price volatility, spreads tend to widen and exchanges’ ability to execute large orders is reduced.

For instance, the spread for a $10 million quote on BitMEX, one of the largest derivatives exchanges by open interest, rose to 4.07% from 1.3% on March 13 – the day when bitcoin’s price crashed by 40%. Similar spikes were observed on other exchanges in mid-March.

Exchanges that are perceived to lack order book depth are often worst hit during times of panic. That’s because both buyers and sellers fear that their trade will distort prices on an illiquid exchange.

Sellers, therefore, leave offers at a discount to the fair price and buyers leave orders at a premium. That leads to further widening of the bid/offer spread and exaggerated price moves. In other words, weak liquidity begets illiquidity.",2020-08-28 10:03:17+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-remains-bullish-as-1b-in-bitcoin-derivatives-expire,"Bitcoin derivatives witnessed a major expiry event with a notional value of over $1 billion. Today, $272 million of Bitcoin futures expired on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while over 65,000 Bitcoin options contracts expired across Deribit, CME and OKEx, having a notional value of over $740 million.

Usually, major expiry events bring about a considerable change in volatility and price that can be seen through derivatives volumes, open interest and even put/call ratios. The Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives market, consisting mainly of Bitcoin futures and options, has grown multifold in 2020. This growth has seen the relationship between BTC’s price and the derivatives market deepen.

Price implications and maximum pain

Prior to expiry, around 60% of the options set for expiry were said to be “out of the money,” which means that 60% of these options have a strike price higher than the market price of Bitcoin. This reduces the chances of major volatility of the underlying asset, as it doesn’t make sense for these options to be exercised at higher than market prices.

While if these options would mostly be “in the money,” it would entail that their strike price would be lower than the market price, making it lucrative for the investors, thus increasing volatility.

Another indicator of expected volatility implications of a major expiry event in the derivatives market would be the concept of the maximum pain theory, which is a calculation methodology that shows the price level at which option buyers would suffer the greatest amount of financial losses. It’s an excellent metric to gauge price implications, as it reflects all the open interest for a particular expiry date and does not reflect any specific investor’s portfolio. Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, discussed the expiration with Cointelegraph, stating:

“Looking at max pain, it indicates that no big impact is to be expected if BTC expires within a USD 9K–12K range. Some are hypothesizing that the August monthly calls that have flipped to ‘in the money’ from the large upward move in the last month can cause momentary price distortions in the futures, as counterparts hedge their deltas differently during the settlement period.”

As expected, Bitcoin was well within that range post expiry of the derivatives, rising from $11,367 at expiry to around $11,500, which is a critical resistance level. This is indicative that the bullish sentiment in the market continues to hold among investors post expiry. Average options volumes were observed on Deribit over the past day, with 17,000 options being traded

Futures and options open interest show opposite trends

Open interest is the number of outstanding futures/options in the market at the end of each trading day. It’s often indicative of the market sentiment and the significance of the price trends noticed. According to data from Skew, leading up to this major expiry event, open interest for options has a positive trend while that for futures has a negative trend. This trend is noticed in OI for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Open interest for Bitcoin options hit their all-time high at $2.1 billion on July 31, after which OI declined in August before hitting $2 billion again on Aug. 20, continuing holding this level until the expiry date. While high open interest is usually perceived to be a sign that markets can lean toward being bullish or bearish, Jay Hao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph:

“A bearish market on Bitcoin will not reduce the amount of OI. On the contrary, the stronger the sentiment of bearishness or bullishness, the stronger the demand for trader transactions, which may increase OI.”

A factor that boosted the open interest of BTC options may be the fact that Deribit, the crypto derivatives market leader, slashed its expiry fees for this major expiry event. Strijers confirmed the sentiment by saying: “Deribit has reduced expiry fees by 25% of which the effect will become clearly visible for all holders of OI this Friday.”

Futures or options — The significance of their expiry

Since the options market is deeply related to how the futures are priced, it’s undeniable that these markets are correlated. As this end of month expiry was significant in terms of size for both futures and options, it would be interesting to note which one had a larger impact on the price and volatility of BTC. The simplicity of futures, when compared to a complex financial product like options, becomes the main feature of this subject, according to Hao:

“At present, the implication of futures expiry is more prominent than options delivery because, in general, users understand futures better than options. At present, the main participants in options are institutional traders. The number of participants, trading volume and liquidity in the options market are far smaller than futures.”

Although, this phenomenon is subject to change as the crypto derivatives market grows and the institutional interest piques further. According to Hao: “As the derivatives market matures, we believe that more experienced investors will participate in the options market.”

Benefactors and the impact on the market

Even though the price implications of this expiry event were not drastic, there are investors who benefited from this expiry. Cointelegraph discussed this further with Shaun Fernando, the head of risk and product strategy at Deribit, who spoke of the positions options that investors held to make profits during this expiry: “Short BTC option holders benefitted, as Bitcoin didn’t cross the 11,250 nor 11,500 strikes.” Fernando elaborated further on the activity in the futures:

“Despite low volatility in the index during the settlement period, there was a lot of activity in the futures (including perpetual), as large numbers of deltas had to be traded.”

When compared to the traditional futures market, where the delivery of futures contracts requires liquidation and/or shifting of the underlying asset, creating a huge opportunity for arbitrage, for BTC futures, the arbitrage opportunity doesn’t exist due to the digitized nature of the asset. Another big differentiator is the difference in volume between the futures market and the spot market. While the futures market is several times larger than the spot market in traditional markets, for Bitcoin, the size of the futures market is very small in comparison. Hao discussed this reduced impact in Bitcoin futures markets, elaborating: “Although the derivatives market in the crypto space has been relatively prosperous, the number of users who really participate in arbitrage is not very large, so this tidal effect is not very obvious.”

However, the size of derivatives markets continues to impact the Bitcoin spot market, as seen in the case of Ether derivatives where Ether (ETH) options have seen phenomenal growth in 2020 on the back of anticipation of the network upgrade to Ethereum 2.0. Hao echoed this analogy:

“The spot price affects the price of futures (including futures and options). We can prove this by looking at the ETH options market. The bullish sentiment on ETH in the entire market a while ago was very strong, and this sentiment led to an increase in ETH spot prices.”

This expiry event may not have had major immediate price implications, but it increasingly stresses the importance of the growth of the Bitcoin derivatives market and the need for investors to further their understanding of the same in order to benefit from such events.",,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-bites-miners-btc-winklevoss-ethereum,"Mongolian authorities have put the kibosh on cheap electricity for crypto miners, Venezuela is seeing healthy crypto use outside government-approved exchanges and a “critical bug” has left 13% of Ethereum nodes useless.

Bakkt’s back?

Growing institutional interest is helping to drive a recent spike in volume on Bakkt, according to its president, Adam White. Trading volumes for physically settled bitcoin futures on Bakkt rose to $134 million on Tuesday from a previous high of $132 million on July 28, Muyao Shen reports. Physically settled means buyers receive tokens at expiration instead of cash. “It’s not a bet on the price of bitcoin,” White said. “It doesn’t rely on an index price created from unregulated spot markets that are self-reporting their data.” Despite the recent surge, Bakkt still lags behind CME Group, a bigger, U.S.-regulated exchange. Data shows the aggregated daily volumes of bitcoin futures on Bakkt and the CME were at $279 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, on Monday.

Mongolian mining moratorium?

Over 20 bitcoin mining farms in China’s Inner Mongolia have been stripped of electricity perks after a clampdown by the local government. A document issued by the Department of Industrial and Information Technology of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Aug. 24, shows the government agency suspended electricity discounts provided by the state-owned regional energy trading firm, following onsite inspections that found many supposed data centers were actually bitcoin mining facilities. With the policy change, electricity costs could reach 0.38 yuan per kWh ($0.054), up from 0.26–0.28 yuan per kWh ($0.037 to $0.040), CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports.

Venezuela’s crypto economy

A new Chainalysis report focused on Latin America found Venezuela ranks third in the world for crypto adoption, behind Ukraine and Russia. Venezuela has adopted a crypto-friendly attitude amid crippling sanctions and hyperinflation, though most retail usage is happening through peer-to-peer marketplaces, not government-approved exchanges. State-owned Criptolago, one of only seven exchanges with government approval, saw $380,000 in dollar-adjusted volume over the last year compared to LocalBitcoins’ $242 million over the same period.

Client centralization

A “critical bug” has left 13% of Ethereum nodes useless, and it could take weeks or months to fix. Parity-Ethereum and OpenEthereum versions 2.7 and later contain a bug that stops nodes from syncing with the $43 billion network’s latest block. Clients are different programming language implementations of blockchain software, a way to strengthen the network by having concurrent yet separate systems running. This bug has highlighted the issue of client centralization, as Ethereum Foundation-backed Geth client now supports some 80% of the Ethereum network, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.

Wild predictions

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early crypto investors and founders of Gemini, believe weakness in the U.S. financial system and other factors mean bitcoin could one day reach $500,000 per coin. In a post on the Winklevoss Capital blog Thursday, the two set out outlined “fundamental problems” with gold, oil, and the U.S. dollar as stores of value. “Even before COVID-19, and despite the longest bull run in U.S. economic history, the government was spending money like a drunken sailor, cutting taxes like Crazy Eddie, and printing money like a banana republic,” the brothers write. They recently met with prominent day-trader Dave Portnoy and told him gold could be devalued if figures like Elon Musk begin gold mining asteroids.

Quick bites

At stake

Mined hordes

Bitcoin miners are holding more bitcoins than at any point in the past two years.

This could signal increased bullishness about future gains, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell said.

Miners are holding more than 1.82 million bitcoins, an increase of roughly 2% in the last year, according to data from Glassnode. In fact, this is part of a larger trend, where the percentage of all inactive bitcoin (meaning it hasn’t been traded or cashed in) hit a four-year high last spring.

Thomas Heller, former director at leading mining pool F2Pool, said this was a bullish indicator, as it appears holders may be anticipating a higher price.

To be sure, no one is clairvoyant, but we’re talking about market sentiment. But there is another technical reason miners, in particular, may be holding: mining factories are in a cycle of deploying newer mining machines.

This phase in the “hardware cycle” means operation expenses have decreased, and therefore, so has the number of bitcoin sold to cover those expenses, Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at GRIID, said. Presumably, costs would have spiked months ago, when miners were ordering the machines now being deployed.

As miners deploy new machines, they also enjoyed a 7% monthly revenue increase in July, according to network data analyzed by CoinDesk, thanks to recent price appreciation and increased transaction fees.

Hedges grow

Bitcoin and gold are reversing losses seen on Thursday after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a more relaxed approach to tackling inflation sent a tremor across the markets. Bitcoin rebounded back above $11,450 on Friday, erasing nearly 70% of the decline from $11,594 to $11,141 yesterday. Gold, too, has risen back to $1,960, having dropped to $1,910 after the event. “Powell’s speech suggests that there is no end in sight [for the Fed’s easy money policy],” John Kramer, trader at GSR, said. Put simply, Powell’s speech looks to have strengthened bitcoin’s long-term bullish case, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.

Tech pod

WabiSabi lobby

Privacy-focused Bitcoin software wallet Wasabi is working on a new protocol design, dubbed WabiSabi, to improve the user experience and privacy of the wallet’s CoinJoin transactions, CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper reports. The major design change would allow users to coinjoin with different values than their peers, a first for the technology, reduce the role of a centralized coordinator and potentially enable CoinJoin sends to other users. This process would operate in the background if it runs the way Wasabi envisions it, opening up the possibility to make “every spend a CoinJoin.”

Fee-less

USD Coin (USDC) has integrated “meta transactions” to the stablecoin platform to eliminate fees paid to the Ethereum blockchain when sending money around. “This enables people to fund their non-custodial wallets with USDC and start using DeFi/dapps without also having to own ETH,” Coinbase developer Peter Jihoon Kim said. Adopted as part of a protocol update, USDC 2.0, the Centre Consortium also announced a new on-chain signature system, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports. Founded by Coinbase and Circle, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market cap at $1.4 billion.

Op-ed

Tech over laws

Shiv Malik, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank and head of growth at Streamr, thinks policies like Europe’s GDPR or Andrew Yang’s “data dividend” are inadequate for putting users back in control of their data. “[T]here is a way of fighting tech with tech that might also result in changing the underlying economic structures,” he writes, namely through open-source, decentralized protocols. “We shouldn’t demand a tithe, we should take back control of our data.”

According to Shakepay, the insurance provided by Aon is underwritten by insurers with Lloyd’s of London. The insurance covers all funds Shakepay holds in cold storage – it covers “physical theft of the media where the private keys are held,” Amiouny explained.

The cold storage is provided by a crypto custody provider regulated in the US, though the provider’s identity is undisclosed for security purposes.

On top of securing insurance to beef up its protection, Shakepay has tapped CipherBlade to perform a full audit of the cryptocurrency company’s reserves and security policies. The audit revealed that Shakepay’s reserves fully back its customer assets on paper.

“There was a 100% match between transaction data found in backend systems and amounts credited to user accounts accordingly relative to actual transaction amounts observed on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains (for cryptocurrency transactions) and bank account records (for fiat transactions) in all transactions observed,” CipherBlade’s report said.",,https://www.coindesk.com/energy-giant-equinor-to-cut-gas-flaring-with-bitcoin-mining-tie-up-report,"Disclosure

A document issued by the Department of Industrial and Information Technology of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Aug. 24, obtained by CoinDesk, shows the government agency has required a local electricity trade company to disqualify 21 bitcoin mining farms from participating in energy trading.

Chinese crypto news source Wu Blockchain first reported the document, but did not provide the names of the farms on the list. Notable entities include two subsidiaries of bitcoin mining giant Bitmain in Inner Mongolia and another subsidiary of mining equipment manufacturer Ebang.

Also on the list is the Inner Mongolia Branch of China Telecom, based in the city of Ordos. That suggests the telecoms giant may also be involved in cryptocurrency mining activities in the region.

The suspension means these mining farms will no longer be able to enjoy electricity discounts that come from a liquid energy marketplace provided by the Inner Mongolia Power Group, a state-owned energy trading firm in the region.

Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of China-based mining pool PoolIn, said the policy will have some impact on the industry, at least in the short term. The electricity for these farms will likely rise by 0.1 yuan, or $0.014, per kilowatt-hour (kWh), he said.

The current electricity cost for mining farms in the region is around 0.26–0.28 yuan per kWh ($0.037 to $0.040). With the new policy change, the upper side of the range could reach as high as 0.38 yuan per kWh ($0.054), Pan said.

Such a seemingly negligible difference would, in fact, mean a significant increase of operational costs for energy-intensive crypto mining activities.

If a mining farm is running at a full capacity of just 10,000 kWh, considered relatively small scale in the industry, an increase of $0.014 per kWh means the farm will incur an additional $3,360 in operational costs per day.

The document, addressed to Inner Mongolia Power Group, said the suspension notice came after the government agency conducted on-site inspections at over 30 big data and cloud computing companies in the region and discovered 21 of them are actually crypto mining farms.

The region-wide inspections started late last year, as CoinDesk reported at the time. The aim was to close down bitcoin mining operations that were without proper business registrations. They further targeted firms attempting to get electricity perks by disguising themselves as eligible entities.",2020-08-28 07:48:43+00:00,,,

That increase in volatility is only to be expected, say some experts, as we approach the end of some BTC futures and options contracts. Other contributors to increased volatility include Bitcoin’s long period of consolidation and a key resistance level.

But what happens next? World leaders have been discussing the role of cryptocurrencies during The Great Reset, the time that will follow the end of the pandemic and the reopening of world economies. As some leaders look for a new kind of capitalism, the cryptocurrency industry is hoping for more decentralization and greater personal control.

That will require a greater uptake of cryptocurrencies. Investment firm Bitcoin Capital is trying to do its bit. The company is rolling out an exchange-traded product that can allocate funds to up to fifteen digital coins. altFins is trying to help too. The cloud-based platform is releasing an app to enable investing across multiple exchanges. The move should make trading more mature.

And even the SEC is trying to help, at least indirectly. The commission has changed its definition of an “accredited investor” to include “professional certifications, designations or credentials, or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution.” Previously, the designation requires a million dollars in net worth or a stable income of at least $200,000 a year. The new designation might help crypto traders.

It’s possible, though, that lots of Americans have already used cryptocurrencies. The new IRS forms should make that clear. The income tax forms for 2020 will ask Americans whether they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired “any financial interest in any virtual currency?” When the IRS takes crypto seriously, you know it’s arrived.

The moves to broaden the use of cryptocurrencies might be too late though. Chris Larsen, co-founder and chairman at Ripple, has warned that US regulation is causing it to lose the technological Cold War. China’s digital currency, he says, could replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.

Meanwhile, other countries are already moving forward. Canadian restaurant chain Tahini’s has decided to convert all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. And in India, the crypto peer-to-peer market has tripled since the beginning of the year. No wonder Binance has launched a new hackathon in the country and is setting up an accelerator for the country’s decentralized finance ecosystem.

It’s not all good news, though. Inner Mongolian miners are going to have to do without cheap electricity.

In better news, Deepak Chopra has been talking about using the blockchain to help fight mental health problems caused by Covid-19. And an interesting simulation has found the Satoshi Nakamoto used a single PC to mine 1.1 million Bitcoins. That was a different era.

The cycles ranged from over 600 days to around 1,050 days. The most recent cycle has just surpassed 300 days, which suggests it could last 3-12 more months.

If Bitcoin’s price remains stable for several months to potentially a year, it could achieve two things. First, it could strengthen the fundamental ground of the next explosive rally as seen between 2016 and 2017. Second, it could cause other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, to reach new heights, as some investors predict.

Why a slow grind upwards for Bitcoin is crucial in this phase

The price of Bitcoin was at a mere $3,596 on BitMEX on March 13. Within six months, BTC has recorded a 220% upsurge, outperforming most traditional assets and indices including gold.

The steep vertical rally of Bitcoin could raise the chances of whales — or large individual Bitcoin holders — to take profit. When that happens, the overleveraged nature of the futures market may result in a deep pullback due to cascading liquidations.

But if BTC gradually recovers over time and remains above the $10,000 support level, it could lead to a more sustainable and long-lasting bull cycle. 10% Holdings co-founder Dan Tepiero said:

“Prepare to be patient in Bitcoin. Each up cycle takes longer to play out and is less extreme as absolute dollar value gets much larger. May or may not be another 6-12 months before price breaks up. Should not matter as end price point obscenely higher. Hodlers rejoice.”

As an example, the past two cycles occurred around the Bitcoin block reward halving. The second halving in Bitcoin’s history happened in July 2016. The bull cycle of BTC reached its peak 17 months later in December 2017.

If Bitcoin follows a similar trend as the post-2016 halving cycle, it could see a strong uptrend in late 2021. This would also line up perfectly with the popular stock-to-flow model that suggests BTC price may reach six figures sometime next year.

What do traders see in the near term?

In the short term, some traders foresee the price of Bitcoin consolidating for an extended period. A pseudonymous trader known as “BIg Chronis” said higher time frame charts suggest a longer sideways price action.

“Holding the daily bull cross is ideal for the bulls, sideways price action can bring these into parallel without crossing, while allowing higher time frame indicators to ebb their decline... ie- I expect relative sideways ranging for a while longer.”

Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, similarly said the cycle will likely last longer than the previous one. He said:

“The fun part is that this cycle will, probably, take longer than the previous one. However, it will be more insane than the previous one. I like it.”

Typically, a prolonged period of stability for Bitcoin has led the altcoin market to perform strongly. Kelvin Koh, a partner at Asia-based cryptocurrency fund Spartan Black, hinted it could buoy the sentiment around the altcoin market.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/73-of-argentines-cryptocurrency-best-saving-economic-crisis/,"73% of Argentines Say Cryptocurrency Best for Saving in Economic Crisis: Survey

A survey of Argentina’s citizens shows that 73% believe cryptocurrency is the most effective saving method in the current economic crisis, such as to hedge against high inflation.

Strong Crypto Sentiment in Argentina

Global peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace Paxful released the results of a cryptocurrency survey in Argentina on Friday. “Argentina’s sentiment on cryptocurrency remains strong with citizens turning to digital assets as a way to hedge against inflation,” Paxful described. “Argentines are willing to venture into new forms of investment due to the need to protect the value of their financial savings. This comes as a result of the economic crisis going on in the country.” Citing the survey results, the company says:

It revealed that 73.4% of participants considered that, in the current economic scenario, cryptocurrencies are the most effective way to save and protect their funds.

The survey was conducted by Cripto 247 on behalf of Paxful in June. A total of 1,113 Argentine citizens between the ages of 18 and over 55 participated, 85.6% of whom were male, Paxful told news.Bitcoin.com.

Out of all respondents, 69.5% said they had invested at least once in cryptocurrency, with the main reason being its ability “to provide an economic shelter from the depreciation of the local currency due to inflation (42.7%).” Furthermore, 67.8% of those surveyed believe that “cryptocurrency investments are extremely safe” compared to their local currency.

In addition, respondents were specifically questioned about bitcoin. Of those who had invested in BTC, 53.9% said the cryptocurrency’s global potential was the reason. Meanwhile, 50.6% said decentralization was the main factor and 49.1% said they invested because of bitcoin’s “overall ability to provide security within an otherwise tumultuous banking system.” While the BTC trading volume in the Argentine peso (ARS) on Paxful is still small, Magdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America Manager, detailed:

During this year we have observed a major increase in the operations carried out by Argentine users on our platform, especially since the pandemic started, registering an increase of 37.5% in the volume compared to the previous periods.

According to Coin.dance, only 2 BTC were traded in the Argentine peso on Paxful in the week ending Aug. 22, whereas 48 BTC were traded on Localbitcoins, a competing P2P bitcoin marketplace. Argentine crypto traders also have access to other popular trading platforms that support ARS, such as Binance, Okex, and Bitso.

The Paxful Argentina survey shows that “there is still a learning curve to cryptocurrency usage within the country,” the company added. Out of the 30.5% of respondents who said they had not invested in cryptocurrency, 24.2% said it was due to “a lack of understanding of its operation and applicability.” In addition, 12.8% said they did not possess the funds to invest while 7.7% cited fear of the “unknown new currency” as the primary reason.

A record 3.5 million crypto wallet app downloads were recorded in July 2020, representing an increase of 81% when compared to the same period last year. In addition, the number of active users went up by 110% between January 1 and August 19, 2020.

According to a report authored by Madeline Lenahan of Apptoppia, the increase in the number of crypto apps downloads is observed right after countries began imposing lockdown measures in the wake of Covid-19.

In the previous year, the number of downloads averaged just under two million, with the month of May and June being the only time when this mark is passed.

Explaining this year’s increasing downloads, Lenahan, says “they didn’t think it would last but were surprised to see that the trend has persisted for a few months.”

Lenahan offers another possible reason for the growth in wallet downloads:

“Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly mainstream in emerging markets, particularly in regions of Africa. Crypto.com, for instance, has seen a 339% increase in new installations from Nigeria in the past 90 days. Coinbase has seen a 113% increase there.”

Apptoppia’s data shows that Coinbase and Crypto.com have the highest number of users per day with 969,000 and 576,000, respectively. Some of the wallet applications making it into the top ten include Blockchain, Luno, BCH, BRD, Trust and Binance.

Also, recent data from Bitcoin.com shows Nigeria accounting for a greater number of Bitcoin.com Wallet downloads between August 10 and 16. From the total number of downloads of 18,613, Nigeria had 3,473 wallets ahead of the United States, which had 2,802 downloads. The same data shows India in the third position with 1,420.

Both Apptoppia and Bitcoin.com show that Nigeria is cementing its position as one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets in the world.

Meanwhile, in his comments on the increasing download of wallets, mobile app developer Adem Bilican said: “Mobile is the way to go for blockchain and cryptocurrencies mass adoption, I am super happy to see these numbers.”

Lenahan believes August is likely to set another record as the rate growth appears “real and is lasting.”

I entered the crypto space a few months ago with a very rudimentary understanding of how cryptocurrencies, blockchain and digital markets work. So, when I heard about a new bitcoin game designed to educate people about how the technology works, I was immediately intrigued.

SHAmory — an amalgamation of “SHA” from SHA-256, a cryptographic algorithm used in bitcoin mining — and “mory” from the word memory — is a Bitcoin card game that teaches players the basics of mining.

According to game creator Scott Sibley, SHAmory is intended to increase awareness around blockchain tech, serving as an educational tool for those looking to learn the ins and outs. The game is designed for younger players, although Sibley said that anyone can participate.

“You don’t have to know anything about Bitcoin to play, it’s just a simple game that anybody can pick up and go on,” Sibley told The Block.

Sibley came up with the card game about a year ago after he realized he wanted to create something that would make it easier for people to understand the technology's fundamentals. Sibley works for an edtech firm in San Diego and comes from a family of teachers — both qualities that pushed him to create the game. Sibley started shipping orders in early July. When we spoke, he had sold over 100 copies of the game.

Being a bit of a blockchain novice, I was pretty keen to play the game, so Sibley sent me a deck in the mail. The game came in a small box covered with cute blockchain-themed monsters. The package consisted of a deck of multicolored cards, a special die and a Shamory sticker.

After watching the game tutorial — several times, I will admit — I had a basic understanding of the rules.

There are five different types of cards:

Difficulty Adjustment cards used to adjust the game’s difficulty level

Nonce cards with different Bitcoin monsters on them

""Attack"" and ""Reward"" cards

Target cards with matching Bitcoin monsters on them

""Block' cards numbered one to ten.

The goal of the game is to create a complete chain of ten blocks by matching Nonce and Target cards while winning enough Reward cards in the process.

It’s definitely less complicated than it sounds. Each player takes turns rolling a four-sided die. Three of its sides indicate a “Mine” action, when the player flips over one Nonce card, hoping to match the monster on the current Target card. One side indicates an “Attack” action. As players match Nonce and Target cards, they add a block to the chain.

However, if a player rolls an Attack, the Attack card is played alongside the lowest block on the blockchain. If the Attack cards chain gets longer than the blockchain, a 51% attack has occurred and the game starts over.

I played the game a couple of times by myself (because quarantine) until I managed to convince a friend to play with me. For context, my friend knows nothing about the crypto space and played the game with very minimal understanding about mining. We played a couple of times but could never mine to the block height of ten. At one point, my friend frustratedly remarked: “Maybe we could suck a little less.”

We’re both in our early twenties, so we’re not exactly Sibley’s core target audience. I decided to talk to a few parents who had played the game. For example, sales consultant Ryan Bergh came across the game on Twitter.

“I try to talk to my kids about Bitcoin and how it will play a big part of their lives in the future. A game they could play and learn something which would reinforce what we talk about at dinner seemed like a great idea,” he said.

Bergh immediately ordered two copies for his and his brother’s families. He told The Block that he's played the game at least 20 times with his wife and five-year-old daughter.

“Truth be told, I have lost most of these games, but I attribute that to the stellar memory of my counterparts,” he said.

Bergh said the first game and set-up were initially shaky, but that SHAmory’s video tutorial made it easier to understand. He made a list of things he could submit for feedback, but after the first game, he said he realized most of the things on his list had already been resolved. Bergh said his daughter loves to play the game and often wants to play after school.

“When you add in the more basic ideas of mining blocks and getting rewards, it helps build a bridge that hadn't quite been built yet between myself and my daughters,” Bergh said. “Ultimately this game is great at reinforcing Bitcoin as a real thing and not just some idea that Dad talks about.”

Cryptominer and influencer Mykel P. also played SHAmory with his kids and said that it was easy for them to grasp. His only suggestion was to see this game implemented for other Proof-of-Work coins to teach players how the different algorithms work.

Sibley said he definitely wants to expand SHAmory into other games around the characters and Bitcoins that came in different formats, like short books and cartoons. Sibley also said he wants to build an authenticated STEM product that could be eventually used in school programs.

Sibley celebrated his daughter’s first birthday just a few weeks ago and said she was a huge inspiration behind the creation of the game.

“My hope is that it helps her see that there is this world out there that’s being created by Bitcoin that is worthwhile to pay attention to,” he said. “Even beyond that, whether I end up selling 500 of these games or 500,000, I want to show her that if you have an idea that is crazy as it sounds, it can happen, whether it is related to Bitcoin or not.”",,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-trader-besart-hoxha-shares-155941462.html,"With the rapid changes in the global economy, there has never been a better time to invest in cryptocurrencies than now. With players like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and others growing each day, the industry is facing a future where increased regulation, growing adoption rates, as well as mainstream acceptance will cause an irreversible maturation in the industry.

Crypto trader Besart Hoxha underpins the need for industry know-how before entering the market to pursue profitable returns. Here are insights from the Hoxha:

Besart Hoxha

Q: Besart, what are some of the key things that investors must understand before entering the crypto market?

A: It is essential to understand the market dynamics before creating a robust portfolio in the cryptocurrency market. As a trader, one might have one or more reasons to invest in the world, starting from supporting the technology behind a project, a belief in the social vision, or hedging net worth from fiat collapses. However, before deep-diving into the world of wallets, exchanges, and technologies, it is imperative to learn about the market and how it moves and operates because of several forces impacting it. Since few currencies are decentralized, whereas others are not, the industry showcases significant differences from the rules of traditional financial markets that involve stocks, shares, bonds, and derivatives.

Q: How can one create a strong portfolio with cryptocurrency?

A: Well thought out and step-by-step market research helps create a robust trading portfolio that will work wonders for a trader. Planned market research helps a trader understand the underlying technology and monetary rules behind whichever token a trader wants to invest or trade-in. It is also useful to know the business use behind each token.

Q: Can you share an example?

A: Bitcoins can be used as a payment method between two parties, whereas Ethereum is used to create decentralized applications and autonomous smart contracts. Such knowledge can help a trader learn the value of each asset before he starts investing in them and building his portfolio.

Story continues

Q: Are there any other factors that must be considered?

A: Some of the other essential things to keep in mind are the number of developers on a project, how large the community is, the average trading volume (liquidity), and market capitalization. Learning about your risk tolerance level is one of the important guides to help a trader decides on the kind of cryptocurrencies that he should be investing in. Newer currencies available at lower rates showcase big returns but stand an equal chance to fizzle out in the long run. Similar digital assets come with a higher baseline level of risk due to the still unregulated nature of the market. Mainstream currencies move at slower rates and are mostly remain unchanged at their price levels.

Q: How would you align cryptocurrency with the traditional financial market?

A: If one must compare the cryptocurrency market with the regular financial market, then Bitcoin will emerge as the large-cap stock. Altcoins are like various small-cap and mid-cap stocks with moderate potential for growth. Thorough industry knowledge will help a trader gauge the market to help him seize the most potential opportunities that are undergirded by genuine research and knowledge rather than just emotion.

Besart Hoxha believes that even after learning the market trends, a trader should never invest more than he is willing to lose. He also highlights the importance of diversifying portfolios so that one poor decision does not result in total ruin.",,,,,,,,,,

I mean, seriously, take your pick: Even aside from the pandemic, we have riots on the streets of American cities, an alarming trade war, negative oil prices and gold briefly above $2,000/oz. These are just some of the loud, headline-grabbing changes that were once unthinkable but now form part of our new normal.

A much quieter shift, but equally transformative, started to make its presence more felt on Thursday, when the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, outlined a new focus for the institution: inflation will be allowed to run higher than the original 2% target “for some time” to make up for undershoots. In other words, inflation might rise in the short term, but don’t worry, we won’t raise rates.

At first, the announcement seemed totally “meh” – the only surprise was that his remarks were not more remarkable. Given the colossal government debt, no one expected rates to be raised in the near future, no matter what inflation does.

But, zooming out, Powell’s comments cement a radical shift in the role of arguably the most powerful central bank in the world. This is likely to influence more than just yield expectations: it could trigger a greater transformation of the Fed’s role.

This will, directly and indirectly, support the work going on in crypto markets. But more on that in a minute.

Origins

First, let’s look at a bit of history.

The founding Federal Reserve Act of 1913 did not specify any macroeconomic goals – the institution’s original mandate was to provide liquidity in order to avoid financial panics. The 1946 Employment Act shifted the focus to “maximum employment,” and in 1978 a new Act added a parallel goal of “reasonable price stability.” After a decades-long drift towards focusing on that at the expense of everything else, the financial crisis of 2008 jolted the Federal Reserve into again prioritizing financial stability.

That role gave it plenty of leeway as the current crisis started to unfold, and let it move into new areas that highlight its false independence. This could become increasingly significant given what Chairman Powell himself has recognized as a weakening faith in large institutions.

With the buying of corporate debt, the Fed is no longer just limiting itself to the printing of money – it is now deciding where the money goes. This is political. And with initiatives such as the Main Street Lending program, it is opening itself up to an almost inevitable wave of defaults that the taxpayer will have to fund. And that’s even before you consider the pain that a higher inflation rate will unleash on a public reeling from unemployment and foreclosures. The “average” target of 2% may not sound like much, but anyone who has been grocery shopping recently knows that the reported headline increases are meaningless to daily life in a pandemic. The Fed is effectively telling them that the whopping 10% reported annual CPI increase in July for meat, the over 8% increase in the price of eggs and the over 4% increase for vegetables (to choose just some examples) aren’t important.

We’re taught the Fed is independent from the government, which gives it the power to focus on the economy without political interference. But its increasingly embedded relationship with the Treasury is turning the central bank into more of a political arm. Its head is a political appointee. And its powers come from Congress, which responds to voters, who could conceivably convince Congress to make some adjustments.

Let’s not forget the U.S. Federal Reserve was created just over 100 years ago – the institution is not that old, in the grand arc of history. And its influence is not written in stone. For now, its role is significant and even essential as the global economy recalibrates debt and affiliations. But things change.

In place

Where do crypto markets come into this?

Crypto markets were born in a storm of change. In 2009, the year of the first bitcoin transaction, the role of the central bank was going through another profound transformation. The roiling markets were handing out unwelcome lessons in the hubris of assuming trends were constant and systemic institutions were immutable.

Just over 10 years later, we’re in a similar situation. What we knew to be true about finance and markets is now riddled with doubt. What we assumed just couldn’t be, now is. And the central banks that we understood to be the gatekeepers to the global economy, are struggling to define their place in a rapidly evolving chaos and rebirth.

Those of us working in this industry watch indicators of a new reality pop up almost weekly. Over the past few days, we saw a blockchain-based security token initiate an IPO with SEC approval, a long-standing and well-respected financial institution get involved in the launch of a crypto fund, and a state-owned energy giant partner to reduce flaring from operations through bitcoin mining.

These big steps forward take their place in the march towards the profound change that everyone working in crypto has been preparing for. Whatever our role, we are working on what we think comes next in the cogs of progress. Chairman Powell’s remarks this week reminded us that so are central bankers.

Progress is not just the realm of new technologies and business models, and change is not just about replacing traditional institutions with new ones. Everything evolves.

If 2020 teaches us one thing, it has to be that assumptions don’t last, and that we all need to be flexible. In a world where everything is undergoing a transformation, barriers come down faster. And, as uncomfortable as it may be, change is always an opportunity, especially when it comes from unexpected areas. In our industry, it’s what we’ve been hoping for.

The SEC is changing, too

Central banks aren’t the only venerable institution implementing profound policy changes that will impact crypto markets.

Earlier this week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the plan for the New York Stock Exchange to allow companies to list newly issued shares directly, rather than via an initial public offering. Previously, direct listings were allowed for shares already held by insiders. This new ruling will enable companies to raise capital on public markets without the expense of an IPO, while still meeting certain compliance rules.

This is potentially a big deal for crypto markets, since a handful of well-known companies in our industry have been rumored to be contemplating a public listing. Going the direct route will make this a lighter lift for blockchain startups, give investors a regulated exposure to the crypto markets, raise the profile of the industry as a whole and give us analysts insight into the inner workings of previously opaque businesses. The SEC also broadened its definition of “accredited investor,” for the first time in 40 years, to include those that had passed the Series 7, 65 and 82 exams, regardless of their personal wealth. As a CFA, I am miffed that CFAs aren’t included (what, are we not smart enough?), but I’m taking the glass-half-full approach of focusing on the fact that change is happening, albeit slowly on some fronts.

A much more significant move is the launch of the first SEC-approved security token listing. INX, a Gibraltar-based company building a crypto exchange, is issuing 130 million tokens that allow holders to receive a share in the company’s net cash flow, as well as trading discounts. The offering price is $0.90, which could net the company $117 million, making it the largest IPO in the industry to date. That in itself is pretty cool, but let’s not forget that it’s a security token. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain. And it’s been approved for public trading – even for retail investors – by the SEC.

Whether the business fundamentals hold up to scrutiny or not, the issue is a phenomenal innovation, and not just because the token itself will blur traditional understanding of tradable assets. As it stands, it’s similar to equity in that holders can share in the business’ success, but without ownership rights. And it could confer operational privileges such as discounts, and possibly other features down the road, because it’s a programmable asset. What’s more, it can only be held by investors that have passed through the know-your-customer (KYC) process.

It’s also a big step forward for a regulator traditionally wary of blockchain-based offerings, one better known for its punitive decisions and high access barriers than its support for new assets and business models.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

Although bond yields edged up in response to the Fed’s new inflation stance, the dollar hardly reacted, and even bitcoin’s and gold’s wobbles left them pretty much where they were before Powell’s remarks.

The S&P 500 hit a record high this week, having bounced back over 50% from its 2020 low in March. While gold has not managed to break its all-time high of $2,061 from earlier this month, it is still over 30% up from its March lows. For comparison, bitcoin’s price is nowhere near its all-time high, but it is almost three times its intraday low on March 12.

The correlation between gold and bitcoin continues to increase, as both are yet again acting as hedges against the dollar.

Speaking of which, the correlation between bitcoin and the dollar continues to head downwards.

Just through pure math, a declining dollar will boost the bitcoin price denominated in dollars. But what about bitcoin in other currencies? Understandably, the performance is not as high, but it is still strong.

CHAIN LINKS

A filing with the SEC this week revealed that Peter Jubber, head of strategy and planning for Fidelity Investments, is the president of FD Funds GP, which is the general partner of Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund I, LP. TAKEAWAY: While Fidelity has not confirmed this, signs point to the fund being a Fidelity initiative, which would mean that one of the largest asset managers in the world, with almost 75 years of history, is launching a crypto fund. Let that sink in.

Blockchain investment firm Digital Currency Group (parent of CoinDesk) has expanded into the bitcoin mining industry with a subsidiary called Foundry which provides cryptocurrency miners and equipment makers with financing and market intelligence. TAKEAWAY: This is yet another sign that the cryptocurrency mining industry is rapidly maturing, which should bring new investment, greater geographical diversification and innovative market products that should add liquidity and resilience to an integral part of the ecosystem.

And speaking of a changing crypto mining industry, listed multinational petroleum giant Equinor (formerly Statoil, 67% owned by the Norwegian government) is moving to significantly reduce natural gas flaring by mining cryptocurrency, according to screenshots from Equinor’s intranet received by Arcane Research Friday. TAKEAWAY: The firm will apparently do this via a partnership with Colorado-based Crusoe Energy Systems, which uses digital flare mitigation technology to convert waste natural gas that would be otherwise released into the atmosphere into electricity at the well site that can mine cryptocurrency at low cost.

Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining company Marathon Patent Group has signed a letter of intent to acquire the mining-as-a-service company Fastblock Mining in an all-stock deal. After deploying Fastblock’s 3,304 ASIC miners, Marathon’s mining power will increase by 208 petahash per second, and its overall cost to mine bitcoin will drop from $7,400 per BTC to $3,600 per BTC due to Fastblock’s low electricity cost. TAKEAWAY: Lower mining costs not only give the operation a good cushion should the bitcoin price fall, but they also afford it considerable upside if the bitcoin price rallies. While listed companies generally have company risk on top of market risk, they can provide an alternative way to gain exposure to crypto prices for investors that don’t want to bother with crypto exchanges and custody.

The average daily volume of physically settled bitcoin derivatives on Bakkt, a U.S.-based crypto derivatives exchange backed by the parent of the NYSE, has reached record levels this month, signaling growing institutional interest in spot bitcoin transactions. TAKEAWAY: Bakkt’s futures with physical delivery allow investors to take ownership of bitcoin via a regulated exchange. Spot exchanges may be licensed, but they are not regulated since spot crypto does not yet have a regulator. Derivatives do. And many institutions are limited to transacting on regulated venues.

Nic Carter looks at the protocol architecture of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the role of fees in each. TAKEAWAY: This is especially relevant given the soaring fees on Ethereum, which throws into question its goal to be a widespread, high-throughput application platform (although the upcoming shift to Eth 2.0 aims to support this). Bitcoin’s relatively high fees also have a role in shaping its narrative (more store-of-value than decentralized payment system) and technological development (sidechains and lighter data structures).

Antigua and Barbuda-based crypto exchange FTX has launched a futures index for the top 100 liquidity pools on Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by traded volume. And Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, plans to offer fully synthetic derivatives based on a decentralized finance index. TAKEAWAY: You’ve heard me say this before: the innovation in terms of new types of assets in crypto markets is phenomenal. Here you have products that allows traders to use centralized crypto exchanges to access the performance of markets native to decentralized platforms, with leverage.

Ribbit Capital, an investor with a $2.6 billion portfolio of fintech startups including cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures (and a founding member of the Libra Association), filed a prospectus with the SEC for a $350 million IPO for a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Ribbit LEAP. TAKEAWAY: Ribbit LEAP does not yet have a business, but it intends to find one with which to merge, and could end up being an efficient public listing route for a crypto business looking to raise capital. As Nathaniel Whittemore explains in this great podcast episode, SPACs are not cheaper than IPOs, but they are more agile, which could become important if indeed we are heading into a bull market. In other words, with a SPAC, crypto businesses can raise funds faster, taking advantage of rising hype.",2020-08-30 21:00:55+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-blocks-cryptocurrency-websites-regulation/,"Russia Blocks Cryptocurrency Websites Ahead of Regulation

Russian authorities have blocked a number of websites related to cryptocurrency ahead of the country’s crypto regulation taking effect. A popular exchange aggregator website has already been blocked twice and has now received a third notice.

Russia Determined to Block Crypto Sites

Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) has blocked popular Russian cryptocurrency exchange monitoring website Bestchange.ru for the third time. The platform informed its users via Facebook on Wednesday:

Dear subscribers, our Bestchange.ru domain has again been blocked in the Russian Federation. Unfortunately, regional prosecutors continue to sue to block Bestchange and other sites for mentioning the bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Bestchange.ru further explained that it had been investigating how to unblock its domain but testing may take some time. The free website helps users find the best offers online, including the best rates for cryptocurrencies, electronic money, and internet banking. The service, launched in 2007, is not restricted to just cryptocurrency.

According to bits.media, this is the third time Roskomnadzor has blocked Bestchange.ru. The first time was in 2017, which was canceled in 2018. The second time was in March last year when the Kuibyshevsky District Court of Omsk issued an order to block Bestchange.ru along with other cryptocurrency exchange websites. It was canceled in May of the same year. “According to a court ruling, information about bitcoin was considered prohibited, as it contradicted federal laws of the Russian Federation,” the publication noted.

The third time started when the Kotlas city court ordered the blocking of seven cryptocurrency websites in January. Roskomnadzor reportedly received the court decision on June 23 and immediately sent out notices about the blocking.

The publication reported on June 24 that the owners of the sites bitok.shop, lavka-flowers.ru, cryptorussia.ru, prostocoin.com, cryptowikipedia.ru, bestchange.ru and coinpost.ru received notifications that they “distribute information prohibited in the Russian Federation” and will be included in Roskomnadzor’s registry of blocked websites. In addition, news.Bitcoin.com previously reported that six crypto websites and two news sites were blocked by the Russian media watchdog.

Bestchange.ru did not shut down, however, as the management decided to appeal the court decision. The court is expected to pass the case to a higher court on Aug. 27. Nonetheless, Roskomnadzor sent out another notice on Aug. 26 about the blocking of the site.

According to the news outlet, Roskomnadzor’s action is not related to the crypto regulation recently signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, which will enter into force on Jan. 1 next year. The new law gives legal status to cryptocurrency but prohibits its use for payments of goods and services.

Yellow Card has raised $1.5 million in a seed round. The Nigerian crypto startup said it will use the money to expand its operations in Africa while making it easier for people on the continent to buy and sell digital assets.

Investors in the new round include Polychain, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and Celo, through the Celo Ecosystem Fund.

In a statement, Yellow Card said it intends to “become the dominant exchange across the continent.” The company recently expanded into South Africa and Botswana and added 30,000 new vendors.

“Along with the fundraise, Yellow Card is announcing that it will be launching its services in Kenya and Cameroon starting September 1,” said the firm.

Kenya is already big on crypto traffic, ranking third, behind South Africa, in peer-to-peer bitcoin (BTC) transactions. Nigeria’s trade volume of $34.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 makes it Africa’s most active country in the digital asset space.

Founded in 2016 by Chris Maurice and Justin Poiroux on a financial inclusion pitch, Yellow Card boasts over 35 thousand merchants in Nigeria. The company says it has handled more than $35 million in transactions in the country. It offers users multiple payment options including cash, credit card, and bank transfer to via cryptocurrency.

In its statement, the firm also announced that Jason Marshall, former senior director of payment services at Walmart, has joined the team as its chief operating officer.

Yellow Card was initially pitched around developing a Bitcoin gift card but adopted the objective of “basic financial services for all” in 2018 after witnessing the high costs of sending money to Nigeria through the banking system.

The crypto world’s center of gravity is Asia. Big crypto-exchanges and companies operate in Europe and North America, but the majority of users are located in the Asia Pacific region, as are most of the world’s biggest exchanges and mining pools.

There are many reasons why this is the case. But experts speaking to Cryptonews.com argue that two reasons, in particular, stand out, namely regulations and existing financial infrastructure.

But there are also other factors at play, such as the fact that Asia benefits from a favorable energy environment for mining, as well as cost-effective IT resources.

However, these same experts suggest that Asian dominance could change soon, as crypto starts to enjoy more mainstream adoption – particularly when one takes into account where the leading cryptoasset and blockchain technology companies are based.

Asian Traders Rule

There is plenty of evidence to suggest that most crypto traders are based in Asia. Recently, DEXTF’s chief scientist wrote about ethereum (ETH) gas prices, which tend to spike during trading hours in much of Asia.

Source: DEXTF/Medium

As the heat map indicates, the gas price begins to hit its peak at UTC+8, a time zone that covers Mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

According to Binance’s VP of the Asia-Pacific region, Mai Lu, the higher demand for gas from Asian users is likely the result of higher demand for decentralized finance (DeFi).

Mai Lu tells Cryptonews.com,

“Asia has witnessed an increasing number of blockchain startups and investors entering the market in the past years, with many projects actively working on DeFi products and services on Ethereum, which could be the reason behind the rise of ethereum transaction fees during the daytime in Asia.”

There are other indicators that appear to confirm Asia’s crypto dominance.

CryptoCompare data shows that tether (USDT) accounts for around 57% of the global bitcoin (BTC) market, while USD accounts for 19%, and the Japanese yen accounts for 11%.

Research from Chainalysis has shown that China has the largest number of USDT users and that there are more trades carried out here than in any other nation.

Why is there such high demand for bitcoin among Chinese and other Asian traders?

According to Mai Lu, it is down to demographics and economic factors, including a Chinese yuan that some say has been weakened by international trade disputes.

Mai Lu says,

“If we boil it down, we’ll see user demand is what’s been driving all this behind. Asia features a large population and insufficient financial infrastructure, which has created a huge demand for crypto and contributes to its growth.”

Kunal Barchha, the CEO of India-based exchange CoinRecoil, also believes that population size helps explain why Asia dominates crypto, with sheer numbers playing a role.

Barchha notes,

“Asia is a largely populated space and thus, even a couple of percentage rise in users can show a boost to the overall crypto market.”

Regulation, Mining, IT

Burchha holds that regulation is a big factor in Asia’s position, as does Mai Lu.

“The distribution of crypto traders/users is fundamentally determined by the regulatory environment,” Lu says. “As we can see, the Indian market erupts following the Indian Supreme Court’s overturning the banning on cryptocurrency trading by the country's central bank.”

According to Lu, this may change in the future, particularly given that the Chinese government has officially banned crypto trading and exchanges.

He explains,

“Many countries in the APAC region are confronted with regulatory uncertainties. While the absence of relevant regulation may nurture innovation for a limited time, it also poses potential threats to the long-term development of the industry.”

Despite the Chinese government’s skeptical attitude towards crypto, bitcoin mining is still dominated by China-based pools. This is largely because of cheaper manufacturing costs in China, as well as lower electricity prices.

According to Barchha, Asian nations such as India also benefit from a favorable IT environment.

He explains,

“IT resources are much cost-effective here. Also, skilled developers, and engineers are plentiful. Down the line, I see Asian countries playing a leading role in new developments pertaining to blockchain and cryptoassets.”

A Chance for Change?

This balance could change in the future. According to Barchha and Lu, Europe and North America lay claim to the most innovative companies in crypto.

“It’s interesting to notice that many influential blockchain projects are rooted in the United States and Europe while most leading crypto exchanges are rooted in APAC,” says Mai Lu.

He adds,

“Blockchain companies in the United States and Europe have the competitive edge in terms of technological development, boasting of many innovative tech teams.”

Barchha also thinks that, because of potentially restrictive laws, Europe and North America may end up leading the way when it comes to the wider adoption of crypto.

Barchha says,

“I believe that Europeans and Americans will lead the adoption side of the market, while Asians will act mostly as traders and investors. That's because Asian countries may adopt regulations that may not accept crypto as currencies, but as investment assets.”

This will present a barrier for the adoption of crypto for buying goods and services, Barchha predicts. However, he continues to “see Asia playing a vital role in trading markets.”

Regardless of its share, Mai Lu insists that Asia will continue to have a massive influence on how crypto develops around the world.

Beleaguered Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchain suffered yet another 51% attack on August 29. The latest attack caused the reorganization of over 7,000 blocks and this corresponds to approximately two days of mining. At the time of reporting, it was not clear if there had been any double-spending as was the case in the last attack. In that attack, it was reported that the Okex exchange suffered a loss of $5.6 million directly as a result.

A statement revealing the attack adds that “all lost blocks will be removed from the immature balance and we will check all payouts for dropped transactions.”

Meanwhile, in their initial comments on the latest attack, developers working on ETC are attributing ongoing attacks to the network’s known vulnerabilities.

“ETC is ~3% of the overall ETH network hash rate. We are well aware of potential repeated attacks while solutions such as “reorg caps” and the subsequent ECIPs are being tested and evaluated. If you haven’t already please increase (which most have) please raise confs above ~10K,” reads a Twitter statement from the main ETC team.

Furthermore, the statement urges miners, exchanges, and other service providers to keep “confirmation requirements levels well above 7k for now.”

Meanwhile, the timing of the latest attack is certain to raise eyebrows. The latest network attack, which is the third time this has happened in a month, occurred shortly after some community members had announced the addition of two new Ethereum Classic Improvements Proposals (ECIP).

Proposed by Input-OutputHK, the first ECIP introduces a checkpoint system to prevent the possibility of another attack while the second one proposes a decentralized treasury.

However, following the last attack, the ETC community had been split on the way forward and particularly over the second proposal. After heated exchanges, it appears the Charles Hoskinson’s camp, which favors the controversial proposition, has prevailed.

Interestingly, however, news of the latest attack appears to have had a little effect on the ETC price. At the time of writing, the ETC traded at $6.71 marginally down from the $6.74 at around the time the breach was discovered.

Still, there is a real possibility that some exchanges will delist the token following this attack. Okex has already stated that it will “consider delisting ETC, pending the results of the Ethereum Classic community’s work to improve the security of its chain.” The latest attack might now force the exchange to act on the threat.

Do you think the ETC community is doing enough to stop these attacks? Share your thoughts in the comments section.

All are in agreement that the existing financial system is broken, but are slightly at odds in terms of how to fix it. In a sense, each of these networks represents a new, if partial, vision of what could make for a better system.

For instance, we’ve seen Celo leverage cryptographic tools and mobile phones to put financial instruments into the hands of the world’s unbanked. We’ve seen Compound reduce friction in financial markets, replacing it with speed, efficiency and openness. And we’ve seen MakerDAO manage to keep something of a stable peg by way of incentives rather than physical backing. In a way, each new project represents a new and different take on what the financial system can be — or even what it should be.

Despite their differences, many of these networks share the ethos of decentralization as a foundational principle. According to the theses effectively posited by these networks, finance doesn’t need to be mediated by an oligopoly of entrenched interests and industry gatekeepers. Instead, a better system allows for broad participation, bringing the ideals of open source and decentralization to a new, more fair and more equitable market structure.

As early builders of, and participants in, this new system, we have a real shot at creating something wholly better than what has come before. But, as money and influence continue to pour into the digital asset space, the challenge becomes avoiding the centralizing tendencies that have characterized traditional finance since its inception.

How do we avoid simply recreating a new version of the same old system? The answer is part learning from the past, and part joining with and supporting the projects and teams who are truly building the financial future today.

Learn from the past to build the future

In traditional banking, centralization is the rule, making it possible for large legacy players to wield an extraordinary level of influence. To correct for this, decentralized networks have evolved myriad models of community governance. Instead of having a dozen people in a boardroom determine a given token’s destiny, these networks put their tokens’ fate in the hands of widespread user participation.

In theory, community governance involves aligning incentives around value creation, storage and transfer, now and in the future. In theory, it’s directly democratic, with the share of voice often allocated in proportion to share of stake. In practice, though, it can be a bit more complicated.

Even in an intentionally decentralized network, it’s still possible for influence to concentrate in the hands of a few large players, be they investors or service providers.

Emerging token projects, in particular, often worry about this centralizing tendency. They’re concerned, perhaps rightfully, that they’ll go through all the trouble of developing a decentralized network and governance structure only for it to be unduly influenced by a few large holders. This problem is amplified when service providers enter the picture, particularly those that only allow clients one option to stake — often together, under one umbrella.

The truth is, all of us have a role to play in keeping networks aligned with the spirit of their founding. As service and infrastructure providers, the responsibility is particularly acute. To participate responsibly, and to avoid the tendency toward centralization, we need to support decentralized networks as decentralized networks.

Align with the ethos and ecosystem

Neither users nor token projects want to see networks decentralized in name but centralized de facto. And honestly, as builders of what really could be a better, more prosperous financial future for everyone, neither should we.

Infrastructure providers need to ensure a variety of participation measures that preserve decentralization. For large service providers, that means offering holders a wide range of participatory mechanisms. It means making it possible or even easy for users to participate as they wish, either through native staking services, through third party staking providers or on their own.

Beyond enabling clients to participate on-chain, securely and as they wish, supporting the broader ecosystem really means supporting each new chain as it was intended to run. Blockchain developers have a certain vision, and service providers should meet them on their own technological terms. To do otherwise — to make new and emerging chains beholden to the technological limitations of slow-moving infrastructure — makes us not much better than the system we’re working to improve.

At the end of the day, decentralization is both the means to and the end for a better financial system — a system based on inclusion rather than exclusion, on consensus rather than decree, and on intentional, active participation rather than inertia. We may never have a better chance to fundamentally change finance than we do right now. Let’s not waste it.

Cryptocurrency is a domain of jargon. ‘Blockchains,’ ‘full nodes,’ ‘miners,’ ‘nonces,’ ‘side-chains’: these are only a few of the terms in crypto that are known to cause confusion and disagreement.

Not only does the ambiguity of vocab undermine the ability of people within crypto to communicate with each other, but it also arguably turns off people on the outside who might otherwise be interested in delving further.

Cryptonews.com has spoken to a variety of industry figures to find out what some of the most confusing crypto terms are, as well as what can potentially be done to make the sector’s language clearer. Many believe that much of the issue will be resolved the more mainstream crypto becomes, while others argue that the sector needs to actively work towards standardizing meanings.

Crypto Terms Are Confusing

Back in late July, a Twitter discussion between developer Udi Wertheimer and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried underlined just how misleading certain terms can be.

Source: Twitter

Wertheimer and Bankman-Fried differed on the meaning of “sidechain”, something which made it harder for them to discuss what they were actually intending to discuss. And, as Wertheimer suggests at the end, “sidechain” isn’t the only confusing term used within crypto.

CoinShare’s Head of Research Christopher Bendiksen agrees that crypto’s vocab isn’t always entirely clear. He told Cryptonews.com:

“Yes, the language in the crypto sector is ambiguous, and it’s a problem that limits not only our ability to correctly formulate appropriate questions, but it also prevents us from being able to properly analyse and debate important technical issues.”

Bendiksen also suggests that ambiguity may often “limit the virality of the ideas [within crypto] and therefore the speed of their spread through the population,” although he doesn’t think this is the major factor preventing crypto’s wider dissemination and adoption.

Confusing Crypto Terms

While a full list of ambiguous or not wholly clear terms would be beyond the scope of this article, Bendiksen names some of his “worst offenders.”

First up is “full node.”

He says, “This is the biggest one in my opinion—I am of the belief that a full node is a node that has validated the entire history of its blockchain from genesis, not merely one that has validated block headers, and not merely one that validates ongoing transactions from a trusted starting point. Full sync is necessary.”

Another is “miner.”

Bendisken, says, “is it a block-producing node, a hashing machine, a mining operation, or a person controlling such an operation?”

One interesting pair is “fast” and “slow” in the context of blockchains. According to Bendiksen, this can refer to having shorter block intervals, or it can refer to how quickly a blockchain can provide settlement assurance (i.e. finality).

“As an example, Bitcoin is often called ’slow’ but in fact it is the fastest system based on settlement assurance,” he says. “When we say ‘fast’ or ’slow’ we need to clarify what we mean by that. Having a 5 second block interval is meaningless if those blocks can be recreated effectively free of cost.”

Other industry figures highlight other terms. Bitcoin SV (BSV) developer Brendan Lee suggests that “much of the vocabulary in crypto is very misleading,” and that even basic terms like “blockchain” are frequently used to refer to different things.

“The miners between themselves decide what goes on the blockchain. This is Nakamoto consensus. Their job is to make public records of transactions that took place,” he says. “Anyone telling you that their application writes to the blockchain misunderstands the nature of the technology to the point of thinking they play a part in the process of validating and deciding how the system works.”

Lee also takes issue with the use of “value,” although in this case his objection highlights how much of the ‘ambiguity’ in crypto results from arguably ideological differences.

“The market cap metric used to value crypto coins is very misleading,” he says. “While BTC has a speculative market cap in the hundreds of billions, it would be impossible to extract even a tiny fraction of that total amount without causing total devastation to the market and damaging the network, potentially beyond repair.”

Crypto terms can also confuse people outside of crypto, as suggested to Cryptonews.com by Luis Cuede, co-founder of Switzerland-based decentralized services platform Aragon.

“I was talking to people outside of crypto and mentioning the term ‘nonce,’ used in crypto and specifically Ethereum to order transactions in an account,” he says. “Apparently, the term also means ‘a person convicted of a sexual offence, especially against a child’ in English. We should probably re-think some of these terms we use in crypto!”

What Can Be Done?

“The crypto vocabulary will become more standardized once it becomes mainstream,” says Ashish Singhal, the founder and CEO of Indian exchangeCoinSwitch Kuber. “At least that seems to be the case until now.”

Singhal suggests that one way to standardize the terminology is to promote industry-wide definitions and glossaries. This is the view taken by Christopher Bendiksen, who believes that adoption alone won’t be enough to resolve ambiguities.

“This is where forums, conferences, seminars etc. are highly useful,” Bendiksen says. “Over time though, I think we’ll inevitably coalesce on certain common meanings of words purely from the fact that the ‘better’ meanings of words will enable more fruitful idea synthesis, topical analysis, and debate, and from there, natural selection will favour them.”",,,,,,,

All rights reserved.",,https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/08/31/is-ethereum-left-and-bitcoin-right,"Hacktivist Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki took aim at Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Twitter recently for essentially writing off smart contracts inventor Nick Szabo as a right-wing crank.

Taaki wrote that this sort of attitude was typical of an “Eth[ereum] culture which is about sparkling burner parties, privileged digital nomads, microdosing LSD, sex orgies and ‘social-justice’ / vague doing-good.”

Pretty much everyone had the same initial thought: “Why aren’t I getting invited to these parties?”

But Taaki’s comments also highlighted the political divisions between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Is it really as simple as Bitcoiners lean to the right and Ethereans lean to the left?

You can make up your own mind about Nick Szabo’s views, thanks to this obsessively curated list of his tweets. Buterin characterizes Szabo’s utterances as bad faith arguing and “incholate yelling.” He appears to regret naming a denomination of Ethereum after Szabo.

But Taaki, who is British-Iranian, took exception to “white-leftypol” Ethereans canceling Szabo because “he doesn’t fit their worldview” and wrote in a tweet that they reminded him of “white left (fake socialists) on an anti-rascist crusade.”

“It’s neo-colonialist white saviour attitude,” he wrote. “Eth is exactly this.”

A savior to savor

To be fair, Ether isn’t exactly like that, but there are definitely some elements that might lead you to draw that conclusion.



To take one example, the man sometimes referred to as “Ethereum’s chief economic thinker” is self-proclaimed “social liberal radical” Glen Weyl, who founded RadicalxChange. That’s the sort of progressive, nonprofit outfit that thinks the No. 1 most crucial thing to inform new visitors to its website is not what it actually does — some sort of think-tank stuff? — but that it stands with the social justice movements Black Lives Matters and Global Pride.



Buterin is a big fan of Weyl’s and sits on the board of RadicalxChange. The pair have held lengthy email exchanges about his societal engineering ideas, which include imposing a tax to penalize “using standard white English” or taxing “masculinity to subsidize femininity.” A proponent of a Universal Basic Income and quadratic voting, Weyl gave a speech at Ethereum’s DevCon that he described as “a rally cry” against “extreme individualism and capitalism.” At its conclusion, he explicitly asked for questions from women and minority groups first. Of course, Ethereum conferences are just as full of nerdy white men as the rest of crypto, but at least the first guy to ask a question had the good grace to apologize for that fact.

Try that kind of left-wing malarky at a meet-up for hardcore Bitcoiners, though, and you could bring a firestorm down on your head, as the author of Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies, Andreas M. Antonopolous, found out when he asked his audience for a few suggestions of podcasts he could appear on that weren’t the stereotypical “white, male, finance-focused” podcasters he talks to endlessly, as he wanted to “reach out to a broader audience.”

This seemingly innocuous request outraged his fanbase (which may have some crossover with the Gamergate crowd) and caused a Twitter storm, with users complaining about how “Bitcoin doesn’t care about identity politics” and getting their noses out of joint at his outrageous rejection of meritocracy by trying to chat to some different people. Even Bitcoin icon Hodlonaut questioned his focus on “race and gender.”

Antonopolous was unrepentant. “I will not apologize for being an ‘SJW,’” he wrote, characterizing the backlash as: “A lot of whining because I didn’t allow the implicit bias to drive 90% of my podcast interviews but only 75-80%. Oh the horror.”

Eth wing

Bitcoiners and Ethereans clearly have differences, which is why Crypto Twitter is beset with largely pointless debates about “supply gate” and “pre-mined coin scams.” When Peter McCormack, the host of What Bitcoin Did, asked his followers “What is BTC v ETH really about?” influencer American Hodl summed it up as: “Liberals do Ethereum and Conservatives do Bitcoin.”

It’s not quite that simple of course: Plenty of left-wing people are into Bitcoin, and plenty of right-wing people like Ether. Even Weyl can’t be easily boxed into the left or the right, as he somehow manages to combine his love of socialism with a love of right-wing libertarian hero Ayn Rand. As Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver told Cointelegraph Magazine: “Both camps are so big now that there are people from every political persuasion involved now.”



And politics understandably comes a distant second when there’s money to be made. As DeFi influencer Degen Spartan said when explaining that he’s not a Bitcoin maximalist or an Ethereum maximalist: “I’m a profit Maxi.”

But still, there is a widespread perception that those with conservative or right-wing ideas are more drawn to Bitcoin and those of a more progressive bent support Team Ethereum. A CoinDesk survey of 1,200 crypto users in 2018 lent weight to this idea, finding that 55% of Ethereans tended left, while 55% of Bitcoiners tended Right. A further 3% of Bitcoiners claimed to be nihilists, which may explain all those Pepe the Frog crypto edgelords on 4chan.

(As an interesting aside, the more hard currency focused the coin, the more right wing, with Monero coming in at 57% right wing, Bitcoin Cash (63%) and Litecoin (69%). The DASH guys must have cupboards full of MAGA hats and Tiki Torches because 78% of them are on the right.)

Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan says there are philosophical differences between the two leading cryptocurrency projects that help explain these tendencies.

“It makes sense given the nature of what the coins do,” he said. “I would assume that most people that are into Bitcoin are people who advocate for less government intervention — and especially less government intervention in money — simply because that’s what Bitcoin was built for.”

“As far as Ethereum is concerned, that has many more practical applications that don’t necessarily have to do with governments or banking or even finance in general. It appeals to anyone who’s into technology.”

Greenspan cautions that he’s not basing his views on hard data but says that from what he’s observed: “People who prefer Bitcoin are the type of people who are kind of set in their ways, or that are of a strong mind. Whereas people who use Ethereum and other altcoins are generally going to be more people who are more open to new ideas.”

Bitcoin as right-wing software

Professor David Golumbia is the author of The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism. In the polemic, he argues that not only was Bitcoin borne out of the right-wing libertarian culture of the cypherpunks but that the technology itself is inherently right wing.

There’s little doubt that key figures in Bitcoin’s prehistory such as Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May and John Gilmore were staunch libertarians. They opposed big government and taxation and worried about privacy, the rise of the surveillance state and freedom of speech.

Golumbia says the ideas of right-wing Austrian economist Murray Rothbard, who coined the political philosophy “anarcho-capitalism,” were also very influential to Bitcoin’s early days. That extremely libertarian form of politics that advocates for the elimination of centralized states in favor of self-ownership, private property and laissez-faire style free markets obviously will sound familiar to anyone who has been around Bitcoiners.

“It was born out of anarcho-capitalism,” Golumbia says of Bitcoin. “Rothbard has these ideas that there is a single thing called the ‘State’ whose only point of existence is to enslave people. The only free individual is somebody who is free of government. And these people believed — and they still believe — that it was possible to use encryption technology to hide oneself from the state.”

In Golumbia’s view, Bitcoin was designed to become the currency of this new realm, money outside of the control of the state. (Golumbia’s theory runs into trouble attributing this political ideology to Satoshi Nakamoto directly, and he barely mentions him in our hour-long chat.)

Needless to say, Golumbia is not a fan of the whole culture. He calls May — the author of the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto — “a pretty racist, sexist, very disturbing guy” and paints a portrait of the cypherpunk mailing list as a sort of alt-right techie version of the Tea Party.

“It is really loud and vicious when you read it, full of hate directed at a lot of people. It intersects with a lot of other anti-government movements we have in the world,” he said.

Needless to say, this view is highly contested. McCormack called it “insulting” when I described it to him.

“They were certainly paranoid, and I think legitimately paranoid,” said McCormack. “But I wouldn’t say right wing at all. I would almost imagine a lot of them apolitical. They just wanted to build a better world.

“I consider them a group of freedom fighters who recognize the overreach of the state, the risks associated with lack of privacy, increases in surveillance, and abuse of the money system by corrupt politicians. They wanted to build tools and technologies to free themselves.

“I think if anything, they’re a group of fucking heroes.”

Everybody was an AnCap

Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver said that when he got involved in 2011, the early Bitcoiners were all libertarians with a strong belief in free markets. He doesn’t see such views as right wing. “Just read about the thoughts of early Bitcoiners like myself, Ross Ulbricht, Gavin Andresen, and others,” he said. “We were all libertarians, not conservatives or right-wingers.”

Voluntaryism — which is an offshoot of anarcho-capitalism — was “what motivated me and others to get involved and promote Bitcoin early on.”

“Bitcoin was made up and promoted by a bunch of anarcho-capitalists originally. Later, its development community was taken over by a bunch of blue-haired San Francisco leftists types. Most of the AnCaps have moved on to coins like BCH, or ETH.”

Kain Warwick, the founder of Ethereum-based DeFi protocol Synthetix, said that no one involved in the early days of Bitcoin could correctly be called a conservative.

“You couldn’t be a conservative in the sense of trying to maintain the status quo in the legacy financial system. You had to see some problem that you thought needed to be solved in order for Bitcoin to make sense to you,” he said.

Meanwhile, in San Francisco, those blue-haired leftists were gaining numbers. Buterin describes two strands of political thought growing together in Bitcoin’s early days. “In the crypto space, as early as in 2010 or 2012, there were a lot of people interested in libertarianism, and a lot of people interested in socialism,” Buterin said. “There was this kind of idealistic energy.”

While the two strands can be reconciled, Ethereans’ approach to rapid technological progress and evolving codebases is much more difficult to reconcile with Bitcoiners who are invested in protecting the fundamental properties of Bitcoin. successfully merge. As Bitcoin’s ideology around hard money, fixed supply, decentralization and security became stronger, the Bitcoin community became more resistant to changes to its fundamental properties. Something Ver discovered during the damaging block size debate that led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Magazine co-founder Buterin also ran up against an unwillingness to experiment when he argued in 2013 that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. When he failed to get support, he launched Ethereum in January 2014.

Viewed this way, the Bitcoin–Ethereum battle is not so much “Left vs. Right,” but “Progress vs. Stability.” If, as Warwick said, no one in the early days of Bitcoin could be conservatives, then have Bitcoiners now become the new conservatives set on maintaining the crypto-financial order?

Jonathan Haidt, in The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, makes the point that Liberals and Conservatives are both largely correct about their central concerns — they just prioritize different values and don’t understand where the other side is coming from. The same is probably true for Bitcoin and Ethereum.



For many Bitcoiners, it’s all about hard money, stability, immutability and security, so they’re unwilling to risk what’s been built. Why improve on perfection? That makes Ethereum a fail. But for many Ethereans, it’s all about experimenting in the name of making technological progress, which makes Bitcoin a fail. If a few things get broken along the way — like the DAO hack, ICO scammers and DeFi smart contract bugs — that’s just the cost of progress.

“I’d rather avoid ‘left’ and ‘right wing,’” said Bitcoiner McCormack. “I’d rather say Bitcoin is conservative; therefore, it’s likely to attract more people with conservative viewpoints.”

“Move slowly. Don’t fuck this up. This is the best money we’ve ever had. It’s slowly, slowly simple, simple.”

“And yes, Ethereum you could argue is…” McCormack clearly couldn’t bring himself to call Ethereum more progressive. Instead he said: “I think Ethereum people just want to go out and experiment, kind of like scientists, experimental technologists. They want to do a lot more with it.”

Mad scientist

Warwick is one of those scientists who is comfortable with change. Synthetix began life as a stablecoin project, morphed into synthetic derivatives, and continues to reinvent itself once or twice a year as new ideas come along.

He attempted to integrate Bitcoin with online payments in 2012 but saw the technology as a starting point, rather than a finished product.

“People who wanted to opt out of the legacy financial system, a lot of those people, you know, ended up in Bitcoin,” he said. “And then people who wanted to kind of extend the power of Bitcoin and extend the potential of what could be built ended up in Ethereum. If you didn’t end up in Ethereum, almost by definition, you were someone who was kind of less open to innovation and more conservative.”

Greenspan makes the point that Bitcoin is also much bigger, which limits its ability to turn on a dime.

“Bitcoin is a whale compared to Ethereum, which is more like a fly — but you know, flies can move a lot faster than whales can,” he said. “They can do different things. Sometimes they’ll keep running into a window in the hope of finding an exit, whereas whales are pretty predictable. They’re not going to suddenly turn around and go the other way.”

Warwick believes that the Ethereum community embraces more progressive politics.

“The Crypto Twitter that I’m in is very deep Ethereum Twitter,” he explained. “There is an awareness of societal issues outside of just financial infrastructure. I think that people are much more open to these things and some questioning of the structure of society and how it’s evolved,” he said.

This political bent shares some similarities with Silicon Valley’s left-wing, utopian politics, where technology is seen as something that “can kind of solve all of the world’s problems.”

“I am very sympathetic to that view,” Warwick said. “One of the interesting things about Ethereum is this idea of restructuring the financial infrastructure of the world to make it more open and transparent, and lower barriers to entry. I think it’s really powerful. Technological progress could be one of the biggest levers that we’ve ever seen in terms of improving the world. So, I still am hopeful and optimistic about technological progress.”



Which isn’t to say many Bitcoiners don’t also dream of a better and brighter future due to Bitcoin’s innate properties. But there’s also considerable focus on Bitcoin as an insurance policy against hyperinflation and the collapse of fiat, which is an altogether more dystopian future.

The flipside of the utopia

McCormack has a much less positive view of Ethereum’s grand ambitions. “I think there’s a lot more interference on the left, a lot more desire for rules about what you can, you can’t do, for that kind of stupid equality of outcome,” he said. “I think, I think you may find that a little bit of that in the Bitcoin versus Ethereum thing. I have noticed that Vitalik tends to express more socialist opinions, which is perhaps why Ethereum’s monetary policy is looser than that of Bitcoin.”

Having an undisputed leader like Buterin in a “decentralized” project also sees Ethereum accused of top-down control and centralized planning. Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow from Blockstream attacked Buterin on McCormack’s podcast in mid-August for saying years ago that “the internet of money should not cost five cents a transaction.”



“That is very anti-free market,” Mow claimed. “That’s a Soviet-type economic event. That’s a central planning agency that sets the levels of production wages and prices of goods, whereas I think most Bitcoiners are very free market and capitalists, which is, you know, transactions will cost what they cost.”



On HackerNoon, journalist Kay Kurokawa wrote of Ethereum that “its leftist tendency is made clear by the grandiose plans of its developers and the actions it has taken to resolve difficult situations such as the DAO hack. Their proposed move to proof of stake will certainly move Ethereum even further to the left.”



But for all of this criticism of Ethereum’s politics, it’s not a particularly ideological project. McCormack himself made this point at the end of the Buterin/Samson Mow debate.

“For me, I think what’s really missing in Ethereum is a strong philosophical backbone,” he said. “And that’s what Bitcoin has, and why we don’t have yield farming and YAMs and all this bullshit existing on Bitcoin because it’s very simple and just focused on one thing, which is what I like about it.”

The love you take is equal to the love you make

In the end, what unites people in the blockchain world is arguably more important than what divides us. One thing that almost everyone interviewed for this piece agreed on was that there continues to be a wide streak of libertarianism running through crypto culture.



Although what is known as “Libertarianism” is most closely associated these days with guns and freedom lovers on the American right, there have been plenty of left-wing libertarian movements over the years from the peace and love hippies to anti-authoritarian punk rockers. Libertarianism is probably best described as a preference that’s at the opposite end of the scale to authoritarianism.

“I think a lot of the people who are building the space truly believe that there are fundamental flaws in the status quo and want to fix them, and I think that most of the time, or quite often, that does come from some sense of anti-authoritarianism or being against the establishment,” said Warwick.

At a deeper level, anti-authoritarianism seems baked into the design of blockchain itself. Authoritarian elements on the far left and the far right might want to impose their crackpot ideologies by force, but that can’t happen with a genuinely decentralized blockchain project — because there is no central authority able to impose it.

“Decentralization is a libertarian concept by nature. For sure,” said Greenspan.",2020-08-31 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/yearn-yam-cryptos-weird-defi-moment,"The Takeaway:

Decentralized finance (DeFi) started out by imitating the regular financial world, but the way its pieces can be mixed and matched has become so easy that new entrants are starting to get strange. Yearn Finance (YFI), YAM, Spaghetti, Based, whatever today's variant is – the ""Weird DeFi"" cohort keeps growing.

Yearn.Finance seems to have been a key shift in the market. It's effectively a robo-adviser for yield in a smart contract, but something about it got creative juices flowing.

Weird DeFi started earlier than this. But the broader crypto world first noticed it with YAM, which seems to be a serious effort to unite people first and BUIDL later.

Weird DeFi has also advanced the model of fair token distributions, where all participants have equal access to distributions from launch. But that's not without tradeoffs.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has made a pivot to what might be called Weird DeFi: a set of difficult-to-parse projects whose larger value to the ecosystem is suspect at best and whose community is at least 20% driven by inside jokes.

“It is a ‘Game of Thrones’ by another name,” investor and author William Mougayar told CoinDesk. That’s his take on this crop of strange, meme-driven coins populating the Ethereum blockchain today.

In an email, Mougayar wrote that the fundamental “bankless” thesis driving DeFi remains correct, but the sector’s real value will accrue slowly. And crypto doesn’t like to wait.

“When rational predictions become outdated in days or weeks, something irrational is going on,” Mougayar wrote.

DeFi started off imitating aspects of the regular financial world that we all know work: such as saving, borrowing and hedging risk. All this required liquidity and each successive project got very creative about enticing users to stake their crypto assets.

This created a new way to make money in crypto called yield farming. Then Yearn.Finance came along and dropped a smart-contract-governed robo-adviser for yield atop a lot of these projects, one that put users in control.

Imaginations then caught fire, leading to the oddly food-inspired birth of Weird DeFi, with its YAM, Spaghetti, Tendies and a side of Sushi.

What are memecoins?

In Weird DeFi (after Weird Twitter), the line between games and finance started getting very fuzzy very fast but, of course, the line between banking and gambling has always been fuzzy.

“If the memes were meant to build a retail market, it’s going to get crushed because it’s not a retail market game unless you’re first to the new meme,” blockchain consultant and Crypto Twitter voice of reason Maya Zehavi told CoinDesk.

According to Zehavi, any transaction worth less than $10,000 has been unlikely to be worth it after transaction fees. In short, retail investors need not apply.

We are seeing a new memecoin pop up every single day.

Before all this, DeFi had been humming along, quietly tacking on value until this June when lending platform Compound Finance began decentralizing and distributing a token that allowed voting rights on code changes (a governance token).

“It feels like there are almost two distinct market regimes. There was before COMP and there was after,” Jason Choi, research head at Spartan Capital, a crypto fund out of Hong Kong, said in an interview. People have a bigger appetite for risk than they had, he said, adding, “We are seeing a new memecoin pop up every single day.”

These new projects are put together out of pieces of others, largely some admixture of the sector’s three leading ingredients: Compound’s governance, Yearn.Finance’s robo-adviser structure and, lastly, the rebasing mechanism used by the somewhat-stable coin Ampleforth (originally known as Fragments).

DeFi’s new breed has introduced all sorts of inventive yield-minting mechanisms that consistently get retail investors excited – at least for long enough that someone makes money.

“The purely yield farming game won’t last. I think it will end badly at some point,” Ricky Li of token trading desk Altonomy told CoinDesk over Telegram. “We have seen this before.”

Memecoins explained

Explaining each one is easier said than done.

So what do these various memecoins do? Their explainers leave a lot to be desired, but we did our best. Here’s the rough TL;DR of a few of the memecoins popping off right now:

What is Yam?

It’s like Ampleforth, so it trades volatility in price for volatility in supply – which is still volatility. One key difference, however, is that each time YAM expands the supply it automatically buys the revenue-generating coin, yCRV, on Yearn.Finance. YAM is distributed by users putting funds into different liquidity pools, and YAM very much leans into governance.

What is Spaghetti?

This one follows the Yearn.Finance script, by creating a pool (or several) that users can put assets into. That pool will seek the best yields it can, even as token-specific yields change. From there, twists ensue. Once a pool is locked it’s locked and the rules do what they do; it also distributes a PASTA token whose only value is that it destroys itself aggressively.

What is Based?

Also works like Ampleforth, but it adds some features that amp up game-ability for savvy traders. In particular, the rebases aren’t instant. They play out. Also, its initial distribution was designed to undermine whale dominance and at least appeared to reward early entry. At its heart, Based aims to create predictable mechanics that can be played in different ways depending on market conditions, theoretically making it a fun game for those with a clever macro view. (One other weird facet of Based: It explains itself clearly right on its front page. Crazy.)

What is SushiSwap?

This one is an automated maker based on Uniswap, but with a governance token built in that really favors liquidity providers who get in early. It also sends up all sorts of red flags.

What is Tendies?

This is a straight-up game. It started out with a set supply that it burns aggressively each day. The burns get partially allocated later to the biggest holders (obviously allowing them to get even bigger). That said, it only burns them from the Uniswap pool so if people get aggressive about getting into the top-tier HODLers, less TEND will be burnt. Also, anyone can trigger burns and earn a tiny amount of TEND for doing so. There are a lot of moving parts, but it’s 100% all speculative, with no pretense of a value add. Very nice graphics.

What is Wifey?

Honestly, the best way to describe this one might be as an association or co-op. The intent here seems to be to assemble as much clout on Yearn.Finance as possible so Wifey can use it to push for more yield. It also has probably the most obtuse front-end of any of these projects, which is saying something.

Proceed with caution

If any of these descriptions are a little wrong, well, look: These projects don’t exactly bend over backward to make it easy to comprehend what they are doing (except Based, respect). Apologies. All these websites seem to care about is how fast you link your Ethereum wallet.

To the memecoin creators out there: “About” pages are a thing and consider maybe cogently defining your terms (looking at you, Spaghetti, and your whole “foodbank/treasury” thing).

Kain Warwick, CEO of Synthetix, the decentralized exchange for synthetic assets, told CoinDesk over Telegram the genre is largely about mindshare. He wrote:

""They are essentially iterative experiments in capturing attention. But even within this space there are big differences, YAM is probably closer to YFI where the intention is actually to create a viable and long-term ecosystem. Whereas things like PASTA and BASED are much more like cryptoeconomic zero-sum games.""

And zero-sum games tend to be won by the people who have already done a lot of winning.

“Yam and Spaghetti and others are being used (whether the teams behind it understand it or not) by whales to pump and dump, and many non-sophisticated retail investors will be hurt,” Henry He of crypto e-commerce firm SesameOpen told CoinDesk over Telegram. He predicted in early June that Compound’s COMP would open a Pandora’s Box.

Each new form of yield requires creating the appearance of value by backing it with another token that has value. Or maybe a token, based on a token, based on another token that has value. All these interlinks have driven some of the critique about the true market value of stakes in DeFi.

“Every level of composability you add increases your risk. It compounds your risk,” Choi said. “People should look at things like insurance.”

What Weird DeFi captures is “the idea of being able to incentivize any kind of early user behavior,” Choi explained. “I’m less excited about any of these vegetable memecoins specifically than I am about what their implications are.”

The optimist's take

“If a bunch of silly people making a bunch of very silly yam jokes can actually come together and make something useful, it could be a new way to coordinate humans,” Scott Lewis, a co-founder of Concourse Open Community, which built DeFi Pulse and DEX.AG, told CoinDesk.

If this sounds crazy, so do all startups in all forms. People have always had a hard time taking startups seriously because their trajectory can be non-linear to the point of appearing illogical.

It’s not, though; it just doesn’t always work.

Astoundingly successful investors Peter Thiel and Paul Graham have both said it in different ways: The hard thing about venture investing is remembering that the very best ideas will always sound stupid.

But it gets even worse.

At its core, a startup is a team with an idea about a problem in the world. That team intends to solve that problem first and figure out a way to make money later. As if that’s not crazy enough, some real successes have come from companies pivoting so hard that their final form – when they exit for billions – isn’t even recognizable from where they started.

DeFi guys are more clear about what truly attracts users.

Sometimes a podcasting company invents a new form of blogging based on text messages (that’s Twitter; $32 billion market cap), or a video game company redesigns internal office chat (that’s Slack; $17 billion market cap).

The assumption is that if talented people can stick together long enough, they can make something great. So how can it be made worthwhile for them to stick together?

Tokenized tribes

Venture money is a way to get a small group of super-talented people to stick together. Weird DeFi might be a way to get a large number of regularly talented people together. Either way, it’s a lot of talent, and as startup history shows, they can find their purpose later.

“You align a group of people who self-select that they want to be a part of that project,” Lewis said – even if that’s people who are into memes about yams. “Then what do you all do together? That’s kind of the question: What vision emerges?”

Pseudonomous crypto researcher Hasu made a similar point, with skepticism, on the Deribit blog:

""YAM has to find a reason for people to never sell but instead hold it for its utility, and not merely the hope of future price appreciation. We should be real here. Their flawed design will prevent YAM and its many clones from ever becoming money. The remaining alternative would be to grow the protocol into something else entirely. It's not impossible.""

Weird DeFi could also just evaporate having made some good points along the way. “At the macro level I think we are in a direct subprime credit expansion (which will pop for sure). At the micro level, I think this is back to the basis of real crypto as an open, self-sovereign and fair launch, etc,” Dovey Wan, of Primitive Ventures, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Wan has been actively involved with the Yearn.Finance fork, YFII.

That last point, Weird DeFi’s general preference for so-called “fair distributions” might alone be meaningful, which He credited YFI for kicking off (though, to be fair, prior projects such as the privacy coin Grin have done it too).

He called it “real fully decentralized governance vs. fake decentralized governance (e.g. COMP model where team and investors control the governance).”

Though he admitted, “It will take a longer time to see which model is better in terms of adding value and making the project better.”

It could also, in the end, mean very little – other than the fact that crypto investors are always looking for a new game to play where some win and some lose.",2020-08-31 18:00:19+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/cryptocurrency-earned-from-carrying-out-microtasks-is-taxable-says-irs-memo,"Disclosure

Venezuelans have become increasingly interested in cryptocurrency as their country faces dire economic crisis and hyperinflation, a new study by blockchain data analytics firm Chainalysis shows. The firm’s Global Crypto Adoption Index ranks Venezuela third as “The country has reached one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency usage in the world.”

Cryptocurrency Adoption Soars in Venezuela

Chainalysis published its study of Venezuela’s bitcoin usage Thursday, which is part of its upcoming 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.

“Venezuela is suffering through one of the worst economic crises in modern history, with its national currency, the bolivar, becoming practically worthless,” the firm wrote. “Under these circumstances, cryptocurrency has taken on an important role in Venezuela’s economy … As the Venezuelan bolivar has lost value in the midst of hyperinflation, Venezuela has become one of the most active cryptocurrency trading countries on earth.” The firm elaborated:

The country has reached one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency usage in the world, placing third on our Global Crypto Adoption Index, as many Venezuelans rely on cryptocurrency to receive remittances from abroad and preserve their savings against hyperinflation.

Most of the crypto activity in Venezuela is driven by peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange activity, specifically on Localbitcoins, Chainalysis noted. “Venezuela is the third-most active country on the platform, or second-most active when we scale by the number of internet users and purchasing power parity per capita. Venezuela ranks 3rd for P2P trading volume in USD, after the U.S. and Russia.” Venezuelans are also using Bitcoin.com’s P2P marketplace to buy and sell bitcoin cash.

Chainalysis also discussed Venezuela’s national cryptocurrency, the petro, launched by the country’s “contested government, led by OFAC-sanctioned Nicolas Maduro and known for its corruption and human rights abuses.” In May, the U.S. put a $15 million bounty on Maduro and charged a number of top Venezuelan government officials with “narco-terrorism, corruption, drug trafficking and other criminal charges.”

Superintendencia Nacional de Criptoactivos y Actividades Conexas (Sunacrip) is the regulator of crypto activities in Venezuela. So far, seven crypto exchanges have been licensed to trade the petro. According to the Maduro government, petro adoption has been rising significantly. Recently, 305 Venezuelan municipalities agreed to collect tax in petro.

One of the approved exchanges is Criptolago. According to financial intelligence provider Sayari, the exchange is owned by Venezuela’s Zulia state, with the state’s governor, Omar Prieto, occupying a top management position. “Prieto is a staunch Maduro ally who is personally under U.S. sanctions for refusal to deliver humanitarian aid,” Chainalysis asserted.

Over the last year, Criptolago addresses received more than $380,000 worth of bitcoin over 3,916 transfers and sent more than $360,000 worth over 2,297 transfers. While the platform’s transfer volume grew over 13x in the past year, “it doesn’t appear that Criptolago is helping the Venezuelans struggling most,” the Chainalysis claims. The firm pointed out that crypto transactions worth $1,000 or more accounted for more than 75% of total transfer volume, but “the average Venezuelan earns just 72 cents per day, meaning very few of them could afford such transfers.” Furthermore, the overall number of transactions was under 1,000 per month.

An expert on Venezuela told the firm that “Criptolago’s transaction activity suggests the platform may be used primarily by individuals connected to the Maduro regime seeking to launder funds or move them out of Venezuela.” Nonetheless, Chainalysis affirmed:

We do however, have a lot of anecdotal evidence that people in Venezuela have become increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

“That fits with our interviews of cryptocurrency experts on the ground in Latin America — users not just in Venezuela, but in other countries facing harsh economic conditions, turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of monetary devaluation,” the firm emphasized. News.Bitcoin.com has also reported on several crypto initiatives to help people in Venezuela.

The fight opens a new front in a longstanding rivalry.

OKEx, which is led by Chinese executives and based in Malta, is the world’s biggest crypto derivatives exchange, with outstanding contracts valued at $1.26 billion, according to the data site CoinGecko. Huobi, also led by Chinese brass but based in Seychelles is close behind, tied for second place with another exchange, BitMEX, at $1.25 billion.

In a report this month, Huobi said it has “managed to push new boundaries against other well-established exchanges when it comes to futures trading volume.” Huobi is already beating OKEx in a few market segments, according to the report, including “coin-margined futures” – where traders can post their initial down payment, known as margin, using cryptocurrencies. Huobi claims to also regularly beat OKEx in weekly and quarterly bitcoin futures contracts.

“Before Huobi launched its futures contract in December 2018, OKEx had the largest market share of the world,” Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Huobi Futures always looks up to the best of the market.”

The battle for supremacy in cryptocurrency futures – and China – adds to the tension between the two exchanges, which have been at loggerheads at least since 2018, when then-OKEx CEO Chris Lee defected to Huobi to become vice president of global business development.

OKEx CEO Jay Hao, in a company update in March, called Huobi “our doppelgänger,” insisted “imitation was the sincerest form of flattery” and said he “would like to think that Huobi was able to withstand this market volatility by following our footsteps.”

Last week, Hao told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat: “At OKEx, we seldom judge or compare our performance with our peers” because the competition is not easily “defined simply with data or certain metrics.”

Chinese crypto markets are big, lucrative and up for grabs

Experts on China’s often-murky cryptocurrency markets say the rivalry between the two exchanges likely stems from the fight for customers in the world’s second-largest economy.

“There’s a natural friction between OKEx and Huobi,” Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Beijing-based crypto consultancy Sino Global Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. “While they have both pushed to enlarge their international footprints, they still prioritize their Chinese user base.”

China has been pushing to become a global leader in blockchain, in what some observers say could become a hotspot in an emerging cold war between the country and the U.S. for technological supremacy. Chinese banks are already testing a digital version of its national currency, the yuan, while American officials have said they’re merely studying a digital dollar.

Under the current rules, Chinese exchanges can’t technically sell cryptocurrencies for yuan, and there has been a crackdown from authorities. But many residents in the country buy bitcoin (BTC) or dollar-linked stablecoins like tether (USDT) from over-the-counter brokers, then use those tokens for trading, according to an Aug. 20 report from Chainalysis. The report called the East Asia region the world’s biggest cryptocurrency market, accounting for 31% of all transactions in the past 12 months.

“By using tether as a fiat stand-in instead of, say, bitcoin, traders can lock in gains without off-ramping into fiat by simply converting other currencies into tether and leaving the tether in their wallet or exchange account,” Chainalysis wrote.

According to Graham, the friction between the two exchanges has only intensified as they fight to obtain a more favored position with the Chinese government.

On that count, Huobi might be one move ahead of OKEx: The Chinese branch of Huobi has joined the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) Development Alliance, which aims to be one of the most influential infrastructure services providers in the country.

“Is there room for two crypto-focused exchanges at the table?” Graham said. “We aren’t certain. But if there’s only one position, that position is highly coveted by both OKEx and Huobi.”

Officially, Huobi doesn’t even acknowledge the Chinese cryptocurrency market exists: “There is not a market in China. That is not legal,” Sun said.

According to the website tracker, Huobi appears to be getting nearly a third of its website traffic from Chinese visitors, versus 14% for OKEx.

“We don’t know the exact trading volume being done in China, unfortunately, but we can see bitcoin flow changes when the Chinese government announces something,” says Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korean blockchain data tracker CryptQuant.

The regional turf war between Huobi and OKEx now serves as a backdrop in their competition for more futures-trading business.

“Huobi has managed to push new boundaries against other well-established exchanges when it comes to futures trading volume,” according to the company’s Aug. 14 report.

The exchange says it’s also beating OKEx on “market depth,” a gauge of how many buy and sell orders are waiting at any given price point.

Tom Wang, chief operating officer of Huobi Futures, told CoinDesk the company’s newly launched perpetual-swap product, which functions similar to futures but without expiry dates, also contributed to the second-quarter growth.

“Huobi’s perpetual swap’s 24-hour trading volume was at $5.37 billion, surpassing BitMEX’s $5.22 billion on May 12, 2020,” he said. “On this particular product, OKEx remains less competitive to us.”

Customers are seeing at least one benefit from the feud: more choices. Huobi announced in July it will launch bitcoin option trading in the third quarter, while OKEx said around the same time it has added three more expiration dates – daily, two-day and monthly – to its options-trading suite.

“We appreciate a healthy competition,” Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKEx, told CoinDesk.

Dovey Wan, a partner at crypto asset investment fund Primitive Ventures, told CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message the squabble reminds her of the way Chinese tech giants vie for dominance in the domestic market.

“It’s like Alibaba and Tencent never fight Google and Facebook,” said Wan, who also serves as a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board. “But they fight bitterly in China.”",2020-08-31 10:00:00+00:00,https://abc7.com/inglewood-cryptocurrency-education-in-business-learn/6397592/,"INGLEWOOD, Calif.

The tools were created for the US Department of Homeland Security.

CipherTrace paints it as a positive for XMR by adding legitimacy to the privacy coin.

Cryptocurrency intelligence firm CipherTrace announced today that it has developed a toolset for tracing Monero (XMR) transactions—and that it has done so at the behest of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Monero has gained popularity for its privacy-centric design, making it the second most popular coin for dark web transactions after Bitcoin. However, CipherTrace claims that its tools will allow investigators to search, explore, and visualize Monero transactions.

CipherTrace Announces World’s First Monero Tracing Capabilities for Law Enforcement, Government, and Virtual Asset Service Providers https://t.co/jcP1tfaKzK #monero #privacycoins #blockchainanalytics — CipherTrace (@ciphertrace) August 31, 2020

According to CipherTrace, the firm spent a year working on the toolset, which was performed via a contract with the DHS Science & Technology Directorate. According to GovTribe, some $2.4 million was paid out to CipherTrace over the course of the contract, which was inked in 2018 and had a maximum potential value of $3.6 million.

While the tools were developed for the use of the DHS to track stolen or illegally used funds, CipherTrace suggests that crypto exchanges, trading desks, and investment funds will also benefit from knowing that they aren’t accepting tainted funds—and that they remain in compliance with regulations.

Furthermore, CipherTrace plans on adding further functionality to the current version of the toolset, with features such as “entity transactions clustering, wallet identification, [and] exchange attribution” planned for the future.

And although today’s announcement would seem to be a blow against Monero and the promise of privacy coins, CipherTrace paints it as a positive for the future of XMR—particularly given that it has been delisted from some exchanges.

""Analytics is crucial to the survival of privacy coins because, if they cannot evaluate risks, some governments could make transacting with privacy coins extremely difficult or ban them outright, like Japan,” said CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans, in a statement provided by the company.

“Several Korean Exchanges delisted privacy coins and, just last week, several Australian exchanges banned Monero and Zcash. As privacy advocates ourselves, our hope is that by developing capabilities for tracing Monero, we can help to ensure Monero's viability.""

Jevans spoke with The Decrypt Daily host Matthew Aaron today, and shed some further light on how effective the tools actually are. According to Jevans, Monero tracing takes a different approach than Bitcoin tracing tools, and the results aren’t quite as definite. Still, it gives law enforcement something that they can cross-reference with other data and resources to help conduct investigations.

“You can’t be as deterministic as Bitcoin,” he said. “In tracing Monero, it’s really more of a probabilistic game. You can say: Well, I have 98% probability that this went from this address to this address, or 78%, or that type of thing. It takes a different approach, rather than [saying]: I’m going to guarantee everything is perfect…”

“We’re not saying that we can identify individuals and we’ve never done that at CipherTrace. We don’t identify individuals, names, addresses, any of that stuff,” Jevans added. “What we do provide are tools for law enforcement, when there’s legitimate crimes, to help them do investigations and then do their work to identify the individuals.”

Kazakhstan claims to account for 6% of global cryptocurrency mining.

The country passed legal amendments in June clarifying the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrency mining that it hopes will boost its oil-dominated economy, which can offer relatively cheap electric power for the energy-hungry business.

Thirteen “mining farms” are already operating in the Central Asian nation and four are under construction, Mussin told a government meeting.

“More than 80 billion tenge ($190 million) has been invested in the sector,” he said.

“Today we have preliminary agreements on attracting investments worth 300 billion tenge.”

Kazakh laws allow the mining of asset-backed cryptocurrencies and prohibit work with unsecured ones such as Bitcoin.

Announced Tuesday, Nuclearis, which is headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and has offices in the U.S. and China, is using the Bitcoin-powered RSK blockchain as an immutable anchor, keeping tabs on critical documents. The firm has open-sourced the framework so other players in the nuclear industry can use it.

It’s not the first time blockchain tech has been leveraged within the nuclear industry. Estonia’s Guardtime has been using its own version of DLT for some time to distribute data as a way to prevent cyberattacks on nuclear infrastructure. There have also been projects using blockchain to track the uranium fuel supply chain and also track what happens to nuclear waste.

Safety is everything when it comes to nuclear. The track and trace use case for manufacturing documents is important because there have been forgeries in the past, where antiquated nuclear reactors have opted for shortcuts to revamp equipment (a high-profile case of this sort went through the courts in France in 2016.)

Some 150 new reactors are set to be built over the next 30 years and the “NuclearTech” space is all about instilling trust within the operators of nuclear power plants, said Nuclearis CTO Sebastian Martinez.

“Part of the problem is that there are many intermediaries in this supply chain and parts of it are still paper-based,” said Martinez. “We hash the manufacturing documents and upload to the blockchain at the point of creation of the steel part. Months or even years later, when we deliver the part, the power plant can check if everything digitally matches.”

Nuclear in Argentina

Nuclearis, which is working with Argentina’s three power plants – Atucha I, Atucha II and Embalse – said the Argentine government and the country’s main operator of nuclear power plants, Nucleoeléctrica Argentina, are looking to adopt its blockchain system.

The RSK blockchain developed with consultancy IOV Labs uses a process called “merged mining” to run a sidechain on the Bitcoin blockchain and harvest the hash power of the largest cryptocurrency.

“The immutability and security that blockchain provides are of the most importance for the nuclear industry,” IOV Labs CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar said in a statement. “We are very excited about Nuclearis’ solution in that industry and thrilled they have chosen RSK blockchain and RSK Infrastructure Framework (RIF) technologies for its development.”

Price Point

Bitcoin (BTC) was up 2.2% early Tuesday, starting off September on a strong note after an anemic performance last month. The dollar dropped to a two-year low against major trading partners’ currencies.

The largest cryptocurrency climbed 2.6% in August, underperforming the 25% gain notched by the second-biggest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).

For a comparison with traditional markets, the Standard & Poor’s 500 climbed 7% during the month, the best August since 1986. And gold, which garnered headlines when it pushed to a new record price above $2,000 an ounce, ended the month down 0.4%.

Market Moves

Bitcoin? Yawn. In August, the hottest returns for crypto traders came from the fast-expanding and often brain-exploding realm of decentralized finance, known as DeFi.

Among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, the just-released-last-month yearn.finance (YFI) token jumped eight-fold to claim the top spot. UMA (UMA), a trustless financial-contracts platform, rose five-fold, according to the data firm Messari.

Chainlink, an “oracle” protocol that provides price feeds for DeFi platforms, saw its LINK tokens double during the month. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, upon which most DeFi applications are built atop, surged 87% in August, leaving prices more than triple where they started the year.

Obscure Ethereum-oriented tokens are overtaking “competitors which dominated the leaderboard a few years ago,” the data firm Glassnode wrote Monday in a report. “The innovation network around DeFi means that there is a constant source of new and lucrative financial games to play, while Bitcoin has seen little growth in terms of its value proposition or ecosystem.”

John Willock, CEO of digital-asset liquidity firm Tritum, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey on Monday that “this looks like a perfect storm of high optimism for these protocols and recent innovations introduced that are proving they have long-term value.” The decentralized exchange Uniswap boasted a trading volume of $560 million on Sunday, exceeding that of the big cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Cawrey reported.

“There is no denying that DeFi is a thing,” said George Clayton, managing partner at Cryptanalysis Capital.

Some of the DeFi projects, with names like Yam and Spaghetti, might be dismissed as flukes or gimmicks if there weren’t so many millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing in and out of them.

In July, when the YFI token went live, Yearn.Finance’s creator, Andre Cronje, described it as “completely valueless.”

In the words of CoinDesk’s Brady Dale in an article Monday: “DeFi has made a pivot to what might be called Weird DeFi: a set of difficult-to-parse projects whose larger value to the ecosystem is suspect at best and whose community is at least 20% driven by inside jokes.”

None other than BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes acknowledged in a monthly newsletter on Aug. 27 that he was “yield-farming” – using DeFi projects to earn token rewards – since the local nightclubs are currently closed.

“While I deride many of these projects as activity resulting in economic waste, there is an underlying proto-banking infrastructure that is being built on the rails of Ethereum and other protocols,” Hayes wrote. “Crypto capital markets are the best place to earn serious positive yields if you are willing to take some modicum of risk.”

Hayes added that he fully expects to “lose most of all the money I ‘invest’ into any of these projects,” but that he views the “destruction” of his own capital as the “only way to learn.”

When he figures it out, maybe he can explain to everyone else why YFI octupled in August.

Bitcoin is closing on a breakout above $12,000 amid ether’s price rally to fresh two-year highs.

The top cryptocurrency’s options market shows increased demand for call options (bullish bets) at $12,000 strike. This signifies a more bullish move in the short-term, according to Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

“From a macro level, the U.S. dollar has continued to fall since Jackson Hole, creating further buying pressure on bitcoin and broader safe haven commodities such as gold,” Dibb told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.

Meanwhile, ether’s price rally looks to have legs as exchange deposits have declined to the lowest level since March, a sign of investors shifting to long-term holding strategies.

Tweet of the Day",2020-09-01 13:15:42+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/malware-anubis-cryptocurrency-wallets,"The Takeaway:

Anubis is a new malware that can target cryptocurrency wallets and other sensitive data. It first became available for sale in darkweb markets in June, and Microsoft has now seen limited attack campaigns using it.

Experts recommend not visiting sketchy websites or opening strange or suspicious attachments, links or emails.

Increasing interest cryptocurrencies, such as we’ve seen in recent months, usually sparks interest in new users who can be particularly susceptible to these kinds of attacks.

A new form of malware called Anubis is now out in the world after being circulated for sale on cybercrime dark markets in June, according to Microsoft Security Intelligence. Using forked code from Loki malware, Anubis can steal cryptocurrency wallet IDs, system info, credit card information and other data.

Importantly, this malware is distinct from a family of Android banking malware also called Anubis. It joins a growing list of malwares that look for vulnerable cryptocurrency stashes.

“The malware is downloaded from certain websites. It steals information and sends stolen information to a C2 (command and control) server via an HTTP POST command,” said Tanmay Ganacharya, partner director of security research at Microsoft.

HTTP Post is basically a data request from the internet. It is also used when you’re uploading a file or submitting a completed web form.

“When successfully executed it attempts to steal information and sends stolen information to a C2 server via HTTP POST command,” he said. “The post command sends back sensitive information that may include username and passwords, such as credentials saved in browsers, credit card information and cryptocurrency wallet IDs.”

Avoiding Anubis: What we know

Parham Eftekhari, executive director of the Cybersecurity Collaborative, a forum for security professionals, reviewed the images of code tweeted out by Microsoft and said not much information about the Windows Anubis malware has been released.

But the Loki bot (from which the Anubis code was taken) was spread via social engineering emails with attachments with “.iso” extensions. These messages masqueraded as orders and offers from other companies and were sent to publicly available company email addresses, sometimes from a company’s own site.

When it comes to avoiding Anubis, Eftekhari said people should not open any attachments or emails that they are not expecting or that seem unfamiliar.

“They should deploy antimalware applications on their systems and scan and update frequently,” he said. “Finally, when accessing sensitive accounts such as banking applications, they should employ secure or privacy browsers which may prevent malware from recording keystrokes or screenshots.”

Ganacharya said that like many threats, this new malware tries to stay under the radar, so it doesn’t have obvious visual clues. Users can check for the presence of suspicious files and running processes (for example, ASteal.exe, Anubis Stealer.exe) as well as suspicious network traffic.

For its part, Microsoft has updated its Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) to detect Anubis malware and will be monitoring it to see if campaigns begin to spread. Microsoft Defender ATP uses AI-powered cloud-delivered protection to defend against new and unknown threats in real time

Other users should be wary of visiting unknown or suspicious websites, or opening suspicious emails, attachments and URLs, Ganacharya said. Additionally, users can turn on unwanted app blocking in Microsoft Edge to get protection against cryptocurrency miners and other software that can affect the performance of devices.

But for security professionals there are telltale signs when analyzing a system. One of these are indicators of compromise, which are indicators a system has been breached. These can include unusual outbound network traffic or unusual activity on an account.

Malware and cryptocurrency

While malware, or software designed to be malicious, isn’t new it’s increasingly being brought to bear on the cryptocurrency community.

“Over the past three years we have been seeing an increased number of malwares that target user computers that, aside from trying to record/steal passwords, are specialized in harvesting the victim’s system for cryptocurrencies,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex.

Ardoino said tech-savvy holders of cryptocurrency usually use a hardware wallet and store their seed (the information that generates and recovers a wallet) offline. Less-experienced users, though, due to the fear of losing the seed for their wallet, might keep it stored on their computer. Malware is then able to access the password manager or other online storage site while the user is accessing it, and copy and paste passwords.

Another attack that malware can execute, according to Ardoino, is seeing if the computer runs a blockchain node that has an unprotected wallet file. Even if that wallet file has a password, if the malware involves a keystroke recorder (or keylogger) it can capture whatever a user on the computer types.

He said there are many nuances, but as cryptocurrency gets closer to mass adoption, sloppy custodial practices could make people’s cryptocurrency wallets easier to target than banks or even credit cards.

Upticks in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), like those we’ve seen in recent months, could spark interest in new users who can be particularly susceptible to these kinds of attacks.

Pandemic poses new vulnerabilities

The threat of malware has only increased as people have been pushed toward working and living remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, increasing the amount of time they spend online and the number of systems they use.

According to a recent report from Malwarebytes, a company specializing in combating malware, programs such as AveMaria and NetWiredRC, which allow for breaches like remote desktop access and password theft, have seen huge increases in use during the pandemic. They found AveMaria saw a bump of 1,219% from January to April compared to 2019; NetWiredRC observed a 99% increase in detections from January to June, primarily targeting businesses.

Is the obvious defense the best defense?

Paul Walsh, CEO of the cybersecurity company MetaCert, said that given the attack vectors identified, traditional models for identifying and protecting against these attacks are misguided.

The vast majority of malware is delivered via email phishing and malicious URLs, which outnumber dangerous attachments (like Anubis) five to one, according to Walsh.

“Most security issues that involve dangerous URLs go undetected and, therefore, [are] not blocked” he said.

There are thousands of security vendors in the world, but only a small number own their own “threat intelligence systems” – a fancy term for a big database of threats and potential threats. Those companies license that data to other companies. While Walsh’s company Metacert has a threat intelligence system, they might have URLs that Google, for example, won’t. It’s a patchwork solution at best.

And if people are tailoring spear-phishing attacks for a specific company, the damage is usually done quite quickly, before a security database or firm might be aware a tailored website exists.

The lifespan, or the time frame within which a phishing attack has accomplished its goal, is about seven minutes, said Walsh. But security companies may take up to two or three days to identify and vet new phishing attacks, particularly if they are tailored for a company or individual.",2020-09-01 16:21:10+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/porkchop-and-whale-coins-surge-in-new-phase-of-crypto-frenzy,"Why did this happen?

Ethereum miners are benefiting from all that DeFi.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,396 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 4.8% over the previous 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,159-$12,058

Bitcoin dropped to as low as $11,159 on spot exchanges like Coinbase Wednesday. The fall was exacerbated by long-oriented derivatives traders on exchanges like BitMEX. That platform experienced $9 million in sell liquidations in one hour as prices fell, the equivalent of a margin call in the cryptocurrency world.

Alex Mascioli, head of institutional services at crypto brokerage Bequant, said long traders were convinced bitcoin’s price would surpass 2020 highs but instead were wiped out. “Bitcoin still needs to break above its previous high at $12,400 to have enough serious momentum to have a chance of retesting previous highs,” he said.

There is a chance that next time bitcoin hits that price level it could head into higher territory, approaching 2020 highs around $12,475, Mascioli added. “For now, $12,400 is the most important resistance level the bulls must take out. The technicals appear as if the bulls may retest this level in the next week.”

Meanwhile, the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi, gives hardcore bitcoin holders an opportunity to profit even when price moves are bearish on days like Wednesday.

“The DeFi market is giving long-term bitcoin holders a chance to increase their yields and return,” said Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer for Global Digital Assets.

However, some traders aren’t convinced DeFi can maintain its status quo, and that is reflected in bets on the options market for ether (ETH). Based on probabilities, options traders have 66% confidence ether will be over $400 by September 20 maturity, but that number drops to 48% by December 20 maturity.

“I have a sneaky feeling that ETH options are going to be in play given the amplifying uncertainty brought about by variables such as yETH and the punitive gas fees,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. yETH is a product from Yearn.Finance that allows ether holders to deposit the crypto and gain yield by leveraging various other DeFI projects.

Ethereum mining hits record fee percentage

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Wednesday, trading around $436 and slipping 8.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The percentage of revenue Ethereum miners receive from fees has hit an all-time high. It crossed the 70% threshold Tuesday as DeFi projects that run on the network are pushing gas prices, the unit of account for transactions and smart contract interactions, to fresh highs.

While fees are a problem, many stakeholders say this cost inherent to Ethereum is a better price to pay than in the traditional financial world. “The DeFi market removes one crucial intermediary – the bank,” said Global Digital Asset’s Friedman. “With fewer parties taking a cut, and much more transparency, as well as a collateralized lending system ensuring high levels of security, all the benefits of lending can fall onto the lender and thus remove the majority of costs,” he said.

The bullish price action Ethereum went through in July seems to have spilled over August. Indeed, the smart contracts giant kicked off the month trading at a low of $346.86 and immediately began trending upwards. By August 2nd, Ether had risen nearly 20% to hit a high of $415.

Nevertheless, this major hurdle rejected the uptrend triggering a 21% downswing that saw ETH plummet to a monthly low of $325.75. As prices were dropping, a significant number of buy orders were filled along the way. The high level of demand that Ether gained during the bearish impulse was substantial enough to allow it to rebound quickly.

By August 5th, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was already up 25%, hovering around the $400 resistance level. While prices were able to stabilize throughout the following days around $385, the most significant bullish impulse of the month took place on August 13th. On this day alone, Ethereum rose over 12%.

Given the impressive buying pressure behind Ethereum, it was able to hit a new yearly high of $447.50 on August 17th. This resistance level, however, seems to have served as a take profit point for many investors. As sell orders began to pile up, ETH retraced by 17.46% to a low of $369.36 on August 25th.

Ethereum entered an uptrend during the last six days of the month that saw it recover most of the losses incurred. The smart contracts giant closed the month at a high of $433.88, providing investors with a whopping monthly return of 26.22%.

On the Cusp of a New Bullish Cycle

Most investors tend to look at Bitcoin to determine whether or not the cryptocurrency market has entered a new bullish cycle. By analyzing its price action over the past two years, it seems like the catalyst for a new bull market will be when BTC moves past mid-June 2019’s high of nearly $14,000. Such an upswing will indicate that the pioneer cryptocurrency has made a new higher high and is poised to advance further.

Regardless, Ethereum seems to have already entered a full-blown bull market. Turning the $340 support level into resistance was the pivotal point for this cryptocurrency to aim for new all-time highs. Now, it looks like it is just a matter of time before Ether breaks the $447.5 resistance barrier and moves to the next major area of interest that sits at $800.

Konstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at CEX.IO",,https://cryptopotato.com/taking-a-break-crypto-market-cap-lost-7b-in-hours-as-bitcoin-rejected-at-12000/,"Bitcoin briefly jumped to above $12,000 but has retraced since then. In the last few hours, the entire market appears to be taking a break.

Bitcoin Tested $12K To No Avail

The past 24 hours have been rather impressive for the cryptocurrency field, with the entire market cap gaining over $13 billion from yesterday’s bottom at $374 billion to about $387 billion as of writing these lines. It even reached $394 billion a few hours back as Bitcoin spiked towards $12,000.

The primary cryptocurrency marked an intraday high of about $12,060 (on Bitstamp). However, it failed to sustain its run and, after a few hours, retraced to its current price of about $11,810.

As it happened several times this year, the resistance and psychological level of $12,000 turned out to be a bigger bite than Bitcoin can chew. However, if BTC finally conquers it, the asset could face the next resistance lines at its YTD-high of about $12,450 before potentially heading towards $12,800.

On the other hand, if Bitcoin drops, it can find support at $11,650, $11,450, and $11,000.

Gold, which has also been recovering from the sudden pump and dump following the US Federal Reserve announcement regarding its targeted average inflation of 2%, also surged during yesterday’s trading session. The precious metal exceeded $1,990 per ounce, but before it had the chance to challenge $2,000, it reversed and decreased back down to $1,965.

The Entire Market is Bleeding in the Last Hours

Ethereum has been one of the most impressive large-cap alts in the past week. Driven largely by the DeFi craze, ETH surged to about $487 but has since retraced to where it currently trades at $475. In fact, over the past few hours, most of the DeFi coins such as YFII, SUSHI, YFI, YAMv2, and so forth, are all dropping in the past few hours.

YFI is currently trading at around $30,500, YFII retraced from about $9,200 to $7,800 and SUSHI is down to about $7,20.

As a result, the entire market lost about $7 billion in the last few hours, despite being up in the past day.

A few other alts are dropping by double-digit percentages – bZx Protocol (-20%), Arweave (-14%), Ampleforth (-11%), Solana (10.5%), and Aragon (10%). Nevertheless, the gains outperform the losses in the altcoin market, which continues to reduce BTC’s dominance to 56.4%.

When signing up for Pornhub Premium, customers can choose to pay by credit card or cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the crypto payment options are bitcoin, litecoin, tron, verge, and pumapay.

The platform started accepting verge and tron cryptocurrencies in 2018. It then integrated with Pumapay in March, allowing users to subscribe to the premium service with the pumapay token (PMA). Moreover, the platform introduced the stablecoin tether (USDT) in January as a payout option for models after Paypal blocked payouts to thousands of them two months prior. While the platform had discussed accepting zencash, now horizen (ZEN), the option is not listed at checkout.

Founded in 2007, Pornhub allows viewers to upload and share their videos. According to the platform, it has over 12 million videos, more than 130 million visitors a day, averages over 76 million monthly active members, and was visited 42 billion times last year.

Similarweb ranks Pornhub 9th globally and 8th in the U.S. Only one other adult video streaming website ranks higher than Pornhub globally — Xvideos ranks 7th worldwide and 12th in the U.S. However, in terms of the total number of visits, Pornhub had 3 billion visits in July whereas Xvideos had 2.95 billion visits.

And the market is responding, with shares advancing by more than 10% in the last two weeks alone on rising volume.

The company has in its hands the world of decentralised finance, or DeFi for short.

The numbers involved are scarcely believable as retail and institutional capital floods in.

In just the last 30 days, the total value in these new financial products has more than doubled to more than $9 billion.

Coinsilium is moving to profit here by investing in the infrastructure that underpins not just DeFi, but an entire emerging industry.

Bitcoin booms again

As central banks switch from cautious inflation targets to unfettered trillion-dollar money-printing programmes, ‘safe haven’ stores of value like gold and cryptocurrencies have been the biggest beneficiaries.

And cryptocurrency is deep in the throes of a new bull market. That’s been shown as the price of Ethereum just hit a 19-month high.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has stabilised above $11,500 per coin, surging 110% since March.

That makes it one of the world’s best-performing assets. Far beyond the 38% added to the gold price.

Analysts have put a near-term $16,000 price target on the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

Smart contracts, smarter business

The first breakout star of DeFi is cryptocurrency lending.

All loans are carried out automatically by what are called smart contracts — pieces of code that stipulate the terms of loans and how and when they must be paid back.

Smart contracts are already part of English law. A panel of top UK judges and regulators confirmed that they constitute binding legal contracts back in May 2019.

So there is growing faith in what has often been something of a regulatory Wild West for investors.

And this is where Coinsilium comes in.

The firm began a JV with Singapore tech firm IOV Labs in January 2020 to promote the adoption of the RSK blockchain.

RSK is building projects that use Bitcoin smart contracts.

Most smart contracts are currently based on Ethereum. But there is a huge gap in the market for smart contracts based on Bitcoin.

And there are a near-infinite number of potential uses for Bitcoin smart contracts.

For example, California’s prime energy agency is now trialing RSK’s Bitcoin smart contracts as a way to bring more transparency and liquidity to carbon credit trading.

As with other smart contract projects, auto-executing code sets out the terms and conditions of each carbon credit trade.

Digital tokens represent a company’s share in the process.

“Today carbon credit trading is not digitized,” explains Eduardo Javier Munoz, CEO of one of the businesses taking part in the pilot. “It is a very unconventional market. Now it will be easier to hold [credits] and trade them.”

Digitizing carbon credit reporting creates new opportunities for businesses to redeem these credits but also makes participation much cheaper.

The bridge between old and new

RSK builds products using Bitcoin smart contracts.

What is crucial to the growth of this business is a key feature called an interoperability bridge.

RSK’s developers have managed to link the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains together so that smart contracts work well on both platforms.

When a user transfers any token, the bridge’s smart contract locks the original and creates a corresponding amount of new tokens on the other blockchain. Ethereum-based tokens can be transformed into RSK’s RRC20 tokens, and back the other way.

“Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the start. We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.” — Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist, IOV Labs

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest and most-used blockchains in existence, but processes tend to remain isolated and segregated to each network.

As industry website Coindesk notes, interoperability makes it much easier for projects to operate on different blockchains and take advantage of things like faster transactions speeds and lower costs.

Projects can cater to a broader base of users who would otherwise remain siloed in closed networks. So it is a huge usability upgrade.

Fast growth, more uses

Those utilising RSK’s model include Bitcoin stablecoin protocol Money on Chain. The project says it will use the RSK Bitcoin-Ethereum bridge to cross its stablecoins into the Ethereum ecosystem.

“Today, the advantages of building Decentralized Finance [DeFi] applications for Bitcoin on top of the RSK Network are far superior in terms of security and other features compared to putting it on top of Ethereum.” – Max Carjuzaa, Money on Chain co-founder

Making the system blockchain agnostic opens up a vast potential new market and user base for smart contracts as a whole.

Effectively, people who own Bitcoin can use their holdings in RSK to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts.

And there are far more retail and institutional investors who own Bitcoin than Ethereum.

Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency market. There’s a reason why it is used as shorthand for the entire industry and the most easily recognisable digital asset.

Fidelity’s 2020 Asset Management survey found 36% of large US and European institutions, including hedge funds, investment advisors and pension funds, own digital assets. 25% hold BTC, while 11% hold ETH.

That means there is a huge amount of untapped power in opening up smart contract projects to Bitcoin owners.

The price drop trimmed the largest cryptocurrency’s 2020 rally to 50% and sent digital-asset market traders and analysts scrambling to explain the sell-off.

Here are three reasons cited by analysts:

1. Bitcoin slid in sync with traditional markets

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks retreated Thursday after climbing to a new record high earlier in the week. A report showing new U.S. jobless claims at 881,000 in the final week of August was better than feared – and the lowest since the pandemic hit earlier this year – but still well above the 665,000 level that marked the high point of the last recession in early 2009. Pantheon Macroeconomics called the figure “still grim,” while Navy Federal Credit Union economist Robert Frick said the labor market was “continuing to struggle, and not showing improvement despite COVID-19 levels that declined in August.

John Todaro, director of institutional research at the cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock, said:

“There could be an overlap between equity sellers and digital currency sellers. The largest equity market decliners this morning are tech stocks, including retail trading darlings, Tesla and the FAANG names [Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, once Google]. It is unclear if this will push into a continued broader crash in equity markets, which could put more pressure on digital currencies, or if it is just a short-term correction.”

2. Bitcoin got pulled down because of DeFi unwinding

Traders have been getting out of the recent speculative fervor in decentralized finance, or DeFi, much of which takes place on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain. Prices for ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, tumbled 8.3% on Thursday after a 7.6% drop the prior day. Yet those price drops followed gains of 54% in July and 25% in August amid reports of eye-popping dollar amounts flowing into DeFi – especially with recently-launched projects like Compound, Yearn.Finance and SushiSwap – attracting attention from traders to the fast-growing and lucrative-but-risky pursuit of “yield farming.” Total value locked in DeFi more than doubled in August to $9.5 billion, but in the past few days the amount has shrunk to $9.1 billion, according to the website DeFi Pulse.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the crypto prime broker BeQuant, told CoinDesk in an email: “The explosive growth that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and all things DeFi has finally reached levels that begin to impact on the sentiment across its centralized exchange (CEX) counterparts, with the sell-off triggered by a combination of stratospheric Ethereum fees. Also, an aggressive unwind of the very crowded trade across Uniswap token related positions in the wake of a number of tokens, namely PIZZA and HOTDOG, dramatically collapsed from $6,000 to $1 in a mere few hours. This is likely because the same assets (bitcoin, ether and others) are used aggressively to structure collateralized positions. Similarly to another DeFi heartthrob SushiSwap, these offerings were also Uniswap clones. DEX and DeFi trading is no longer a hobbyist activity and a number of firms that dominated CEX space have recently ventured out into DeFi to generate alpha. As such the Chinese wall that once separated markets is no longer in place and sentiment from one market will flow into another, and vice versa.”

3. Miners sold some of their bitcoin

Bitcoin miners and possibly traders decided to take risk off the table by trading in some of their cryptocurrency, which they receive as rewards for helping to maintain the security of the blockchain network. CoinDesk reported prior to Thursday’s sell-off that blockchain data were showing elevated transfers of bitcoin to exchange wallets, typically seen as a precursor of heightened selling pressure. According to CryptoQuant, a blockchain-data analysis firm, tracking of major bitcoin-mining pools showed an increase in bitcoin being transferred out – ostensibly also to exchanges for a possible sale.

Ki Young Yu, founder of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat: “Miners are good traders. I think they are just looking for selling opportunities, not capitulation. I think it’s going to be the war of miners between those who want a bitcoin price rally and those who don’t. Some Chinese miners already realize their mining profitability (ROI), and they might not want new mining competitors joining the industry because of the bull market.”",2020-09-03 17:22:51+00:00,https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-technology-europe-de66352be124548602481d3e88e2d4ff,"GENEVA (AP) — A Swiss region that has billed itself as a hub for high-tech finance said Thursday that it plans to accept cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether for tax payments starting next year.

Switzerland’s Zug canton joins its eponymous main city and several Swiss towns in agreeing to take tax payments in cryptocurrency. Zug is thought to be the first region in the rich Alpine country to make the decision.

The canton, which bills itself as home to “Crypto Valley,” said it would accept taxes from companies or individuals of up to 100,000 Swiss francs (about $110,000) paid in Bitcoin or Ether as of February. A pilot program is expected to be launched in the coming weeks.

“We are not taking any risks with the new payment method, as we always receive the amount in Swiss francs, even when paying in Bitcoin or Ether,” cantonal finance director Heinz Taennler said in a statement.

Taxpayers who want to pay in cryptocurrency would notify tax authorities, who in return would send a digitized QR code that allows for such payments.

Other places have explored accepting cryptocurrencies for tax payments. A former treasurer in the U.S. state of Ohio launched OhioCrypto.com in 2018 for business tax payments. The state’s attorney general ruled last year that the program was illegal, casting doubt over its future.",2020-09-03 12:32:39+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-valley-residents-can-now-pay-taxes-in-bitcoin,"The Swiss canton of Zug is making it easier to imagine a world in which cryptocurrency users are resolutely in the mainstream.

The canton — which has earned itself the moniker of ""Crypto Valley"" for its positive stance towards cryptocurrencies — will begin allowing citizens to pay taxes in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

According to Bloomberg on Sept. 3, “tax settlement by means of crypto currency will be available to both companies and private individuals up to an amount of 100,000 Swiss francs ($109,670).”

Roughly 127,000 people live in the region, which has previously taken steps to accept Bitcoin payments for select government services.

The new, significantly more wide-ranging move to accept taxes in crypto has been enabled by a partnership between the canton and crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse AG, which is based in Zug.

Bitcoin Suisse has previously partnered with Swiss authorities in Zermatt to enable taxpayers in that region to use Bitcoin as a means of payments.

Bitcoin Suisse founder Niklas Nikolajsen bullishly told reporters that “there’s almost nothing controversial about trading Bitcoin anymore. It’s completely mainstream.”

In his view, Bitcoin’s strong rally during the coronavirus pandemic is likely to strengthen the case for the currency’s resilience and longevity amid a rapidly changing economic landscape.

Despite this horizon, in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, local cryptocurrency firms have struggled. The Swiss federal government recently rejected a 100 million franc request by the canton of Zug intended to help keep local crypto businesses afloat.",,https://www.coindesk.com/russia-ban-crypto-miners,"The Russian Ministry of Finance has drawn up a new draft bill that echoes a previous attempt to outlaw cryptocurrency use and, if passed, would have a major impact on the nation’s crypto miners.

The document, sent by the ministry to other government branches for feedback, states that miners located in Russia and using Russia-based infrastructure may not be rewarded for their work in cryptocurrency, according to the Russian newspaper Izvestia, which first reported the bill.

The draft is intended to amend a new law on digital assets signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of July.

Blow for miners

If the bill becomes a law, it might push individual miners outside of lawful operations, says Igor Runets, CEO of BitRiver, one of the largest mining farms in Russia. “They receive crypto as a reward [for recording transactions on the blockchain], and this becomes illegal,” Runets said.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

A way around this issue would be for a miner or mining farm to establish a foreign entity through which to conduct its finances, Runets suggested. However, the process isn’t cheap, and wouldn’t be an option for small miners that can’t afford the legal costs.

The draft bill, obtained by CoinDesk (see below), states that the “actions allowing third parties to use digital currency, creation of software and hardware for issuance of the digital currency and transactions with it in the computer systems created by the foreign laws,” are “not forbidden.” However, accepting digital assets as a payment for such work would be outlawed.

The new rules could affect facilities in Russia that host clients’ mining devices and get paid in cryptocurrency for the electricity and services they provide.

According to Jakhon Khabilov, head of the Sigmapool mining pool, currently only smaller mining farms in Russia accept crypto as payment, while larger ones are paid in fiat currency via bank transfers.

Prison threat

The bill includes stipulations from a previous draft, introduced into the Russian parliament but abandoned after a public outcry. Both state that Russian citizens can only possess crypto assets if they inherit them, receive them as debtors of a bankrupt company or receive them as compensation after winning a lawsuit.

The new draft also carries over the proposal that illegal issuance and usage of cryptocurrency, and accepting it as a means of payment, should be punished with fines of up to 1 million Russian rubles (about $13,240) or up to seven years in prison.

These measures were introduced in May but met strong criticism from the Russian crypto community as well as from the country’s Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economic Development.

LONDON (Reuters) - Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance said on Thursday it was joining a European blockchain industry group, a move that comes as policymakers look at how to oversee the emerging digital ledger technology.

In a statement, Binance said it would join Blockchain for Europe, a Brussels-based association whose members include major U.S. blockchain payments firm Ripple. Blockchain for Europe advocates for “balanced policy and regulatory governance” for the distributed ledger technology, Binance said.

The European Union is looking at creating a set of rules for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and related technologies such as blockchain-based digital contracts.

At present, the EU has no specific regulations on cryptocurrencies. Until Facebook unveiled plans for the Libra digital currency last year, digital coins had been seen as a marginal issue in Brussels because only a fraction are converted into euros.

Crypto for taxes

People and businesses in the Swiss canton of Zug, home to “Crypto Valley,” will be able to pay their taxes in bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) beginning next February. Authorities have partnered with the Zug-based crypto broker and custodian Bitcoin Suisse, which will convert cryptocurrency payments into Swiss francs and hand them over to the tax office. The canton will accept tax payments up to 100,000 CHF (around $109,000) in those cryptos, though no partial payment will be accepted. In a statement Thursday, Zug Finance Director Heinz Tannler said the move would help to normalize the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life.

Another Twitter hack

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has become the latest victim of a Twitter hack meant to siphon cryptocurrency from unsuspecting users. A Twitter account of Modi’s personal website known as the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was hacked and began soliciting 2.5 million followers to donate to the relief fund using cryptocurrency, the Nikkei Asian Review reported and Twitter confirmed. The social media giant is “not aware of additional accounts being impacted,” a Twitter representative said. Modi’s hack follows a high-profile breach that compromised several accounts, including those of U.S. Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Kanye West and CoinDesk. The alleged perpetrators of that attack have been apprehended.

Full disclosure

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is calling upon Coinbase to release regular transparency reports related to the government and law enforcement requests for information it receives. In a Wednesday blog post, the digital advocacy nonprofit said financial data is one of the “most sensitive types of information” a user produces. The way Coinbase responds to government requests could “have a huge impact on what types of speech thrive online,” CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. In June, Coinbase initiated procurement deals with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for its investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics,” which traces transactions conducted across the exchange ecosystem.

COVID-19 relief

The Congressional Blockchain Caucus is urging President Donald Trump and other federal officials to adopt blockchain solutions to boost COVID-19 relief efforts. In a Wednesday letter, lawmakers said blockchain technology can help identify and authenticate individuals set to receive government benefits, streamline supply chains and create a registry of medical professionals. They further cited blockchain’s strong encryption mechanism that protects sensitive data. The U.S. government’s response to a pandemic has been a case study in governmental inefficiency, with states duking it out over critical supplies. Last April, 11 representatives signed a letter calling on the U.S Treasury Department to consider blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in streamlining the distribution of stimulus funds to citizens across the nation.

At stake

Tether financialization

Credit default swaps (CDS), known for their role in the 2008 recession, have come to the Ethereum blockchain. Derivatives exchange Opium has introduced CDS for the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT), providing insurance to buyers in case Tether, the issuer of the stablecoin, defaults.

Tether, a key component of the crypto marketplace and fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, claims a 1-to-1 backing with U.S. dollars. This is often contested.

Tether revealed in April 2019 that only 74% of USDT was backed by “cash and cash equivalents.” The firm later said USDT was once again fully backed in a November 2019 retort to an academic paper that blamed the stablecoin for the 2017 bitcoin bubble.

Further, the firm behind the stablecoin is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s office for alleged misappropriation of funds.

Opium’s CDS product finally lets the controversial crypto’s critics and defenders “put their money where their mouths are,” CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.

A CDS is a “transfer of the insurance from people who know and are confident to people who’d like to be insured. Derivatives are just about transferring the risk. Some people would like to have the risk and get paid, some people would like to pay to get rid of risk,” Opium founder Andrey Belyakov said.

The new CDS tethered to USDT can be customized to pay out under different scenarios, such as the stablecoin falling under a preset value, said Aave founder Stani Kulechov, who is advising Opium.

In this case, a sharp drop in USDT’s price from the usual $1 is used as a proxy for Tether turning out to be insolvent. So if the token fell to 70 cents, the writer of the contract would pay the buyer 30 cents at maturity.

Investors don’t need to hold USDT to purchase this coverage. They can use CDS to bet against the asset, while those who trust Tether to honor its obligations can earn a premium for standing ready to cover defaults.

Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said through a spokesman: “Tether is solvent. Therefore, this solution is not really interesting to us or our community.”

Market intel

Steep pullback

Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back about $403 to $10,838 early Thursday, deepening a two-day sell-off that pushed the largest cryptocurrency to its lowest point in a month. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole previously reported an influx of 92,000 BTC on Wednesday – the biggest-single day rise in 37 days – could deepen bitcoin’s descent. “Inflows surged as people rushed to sell at near $12,000,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Thursday. There’s evidence exchanges have not fully absorbed this selloff, hinting at a lack of buyers, which could lead to a profound drop in price.

Ether options

Ether option contracts listed on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, rose to a record high of $507 million on Tuesday. This is possibly due to yield farming, the act of putting crypto holdings to work on decentralized applications to earn more crypto, Godbole reports. Open positions in ether options have surged by 45% from $349 million to $507 million over the past five days and nearly doubled since the end of July, while the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi applications has surged by over 20% to $8.65 billion in the past five days.

Hypothetical attack

A recently disclosed vulnerability in popular Trezor and KeepKey hardware wallets would have allowed attackers to hold users’ cryptocurrency for ransom without going anywhere near the device, CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports. ShiftCrypto, the Swiss company that manufactures the BitBox hardware wallet, has disclosed a potential man-in-the middle ransom attack vector that leverages the two wallet’s optional passphrase feature users can use to unlock their device in lieu of a PIN. Trezor has issued a patch, KeepKey has delayed taking action, though it has not been suggested the hypothetical attack has been carried out.

Author of “The Business Blockchain,” William Mougayar thinks centralized finance and decentralized finance should link up for each other’s benefit. “CeFi” will bring users and expertise to DeFi – which will struggle to grow beyond its pen of hardcore users – but must begin thinking like wholesalers and hurry to “pick the DeFi products they want to build on top of,” he writes. “The CeFi market potential is staring DeFi in the face. If CeFi exchanges want to start looking more like full-service financial services institutions, they need to become DeFi’s best distribution channels.”

“It looks like some bitcoin holders decided that this last failed breakout was one too many,” he told CoinDesk. “A full move could potentially bring the price back toward $9,500.

Lifchitz added that a few more fundamental factors that might be influencing the bearish bitcoin run.

“We observed that the market started to fade as South Korea’s largest exchange, Bithumb, had been raided by police,” he noted.

“It could also be miners deciding to monetize their rewards,” Lifchitz added. Indeed, bitcoin holders, which could include larger holders such as miners, are pushing more inflows into exchanges to its highest levels since late July.

“In my opinion, this is a classic case of an overstretched market, which had advanced too much too quickly, and so was in dire need of consolidation,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of multi-asset manager Tellurian Capital. “Crypto is dropping in sympathy with other traditional risk assets,” he added.

Investors also continue to lock bitcoin into decentralized finance. There are now over 74,000 BTC in use on Ethereum as those who lock in bitcoin gain a yield or profit in the DeFi ecosystem. In the past week, the amount of bitcoin in DeFi has increased 33%.

Registered with the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the entity can provide services of exchanging fiat currencies into cryptocurrency. At present, BitofHeaven provides access to BTC and ETH, using a comprehensive exchange infrastructure and competitive conditions.

Due to its registered nature, bitofheaven.io has a clear edge against other competitors, being able to provide a strong, safe, and secure exchange environment, where customers don’t have to worry about law compliance. BitOfHeaven is committed to the highest cryptocurrency exchange standards and wants to make sure that all customers will get to benefit from its services.",,https://www.etftrends.com/disruptive-technology-channel/unique-avenues-for-indirect-bitcoin-exposure/,"One of the most often cited knocks against bitcoin is that digital assets are volatile. While the largest cryptocurrency has had its bouts with turbulence, some investors may be surprised to learn bitcoin actually has some favorable volatility statistics.

Bitcoin proponents argue that it is the ultimate alternative asset, combining high potential returns with low correlations and intraday liquidity. Has that held up during the recent market volatility? Other critics believe bitcoin is an asset bubble destined to pop, but ARK Invest sees a contender in the global monetary arena.

However, even today, bitcoin’s origins are worth remembering as investors evaluate the digital asset’s place in the world money universe.

“Social media networks have transformed the way we communicate and interact. Online marketplaces have led to widespread, instant commercial matchmaking,” writes ARK cryptocurrency analyst Yassine Elmandjra. “Digital media platforms allow the streaming of content libraries consumed on-demand. Perhaps the most notable institution to rise from the creation of these tools, Bitcoin has called into question the very basis of economic organization.”

Accessing Bitcoin ETFs

The idea of decentralized currencies goes far beyond bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, all kinds of companies, organizations, and governments are exploring the concept of initial coin offerings, or ICOs.

Businesses and currencies exist for roughly the same purpose: to facilitate the exchange of value. Fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar are positively primitive compared with the promise of blockchain and the emerging token economy, which some technologists have taken to calling an asset operating system

Vexing bitcoin fans is that U.S. regulators still haven’t approved access to the digital coin via the ETFs wrapper. However, ARK offers alternatives.

Until U.S. regulators approve a dedicated bitcoin exchange traded product, some ETFs with backdoor exposure to the largest digital currency can serve as adequate ways in playing increased bitcoin adoption. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKF) is one of those ETFs. ARKF’s exposure to digital wallet names, such as Square (NYSE: SQ), provides investors with an avenue for bitcoin access in their portfolios.

“Meanwhile, fintech apps that offer crypto are making money. Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018. Cash App reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report,” according to CoinDesk.

The ARK Web x.0 ETF (NYSEArca: ARKW) is another idea for bitcoin exposure as it holds a position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC ). ARKW is one of the best-performing actively managed ETFs this year.

Discussions surrounding cryptocurrency payment platforms have captured the attention of investors worldwide, specifically on whether digital currencies are useful in the retail sector. For instance, the growth and widespread adoption of ‘stable-coins’ has nudged 20,000 merchants to accept crypto payments. The list of parties interested in crypto-transactions, however, is not merely limited to small businesses; we have seen that corporations like Microsoft, Overstock, Namecheap, Starbucks, Whole Foods, CheapAir, Travala, and Expedia have all shifted their attention.

The $250 Billion crypto payment market, though broad, can be best understood by examining three major categories: P2P Retail Payments, Crypto Custody, and Merchant Plugin and Gateways.

Square’s Cash App – A Leader In P2P Crypto Retail Payments

Since January, the stock market value of Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) has risen in value by 148%; last year alone, the stock grew by 137%. As claimed by analysts, one should anticipate that if Square’s Cash App continues to perform, its SQ stock price could increase by 400% within 4 to 5 years, matching the capitalization of companies like PayPal. Undoubtedly, the firm has garnered the interest of investors. Most importantly, however, it has demonstrated an ability to generate profit, as evidenced by its Q2 earnings report for 2020, which revealed that Cash App’s gross profit grew by 167%, totalling to $281 million.

One explanation for CashApp’s popularity may be attributed to Bitcoin, as the platform allows its users to buy, sell, and transfer it. This is especially significant, as it has been consistently demonstrated that younger users’ favour this means of payment. As a result, Square’s Bitcoin gross profit jumped by 711%.

The list of features offered by Cash App goes on. One new idea currently under pilot testing would allow members of its ‘Cash App P2P Payments’ service to obtain small, short-term loans. 1000 users were offered such loans, ranging from $20 – $200, to be paid back within four weeks at a 5% flat interest rate. Whether successful or not, this attempt to explore possibilities by Square is an indicator of its willingness to expand their business model.

Offering small loans is expected to broaden Cash App’s lending efforts, and could eventually become a more complete financial payment solution when compared to PayPal. As such, Square Capital, the firm's lending arm, has been able to support merchants with micro-finance schemes for years, and is even approved to operate as a bank.

Just as important to analyse, however, are Cash App’s competitors. For instance, Coinbase offers its members the ability to borrow cash against their Bitcoin holdings, and is preparing an IPO to launch a waitlist for customers. Users will be able to borrow up to 30% of $20,000 of their Bitcoin holdings at an 8% APR, which is less competitive than the majority of competing crypto lending solutions. Yet given US regulatory limitations, this solution is expected to receive a lot of adoption, since there will be no special applications or credit checks required.

Other key competitors like Venmo and Zelle have furthered their respective lending programs, suggesting that they too see the potential of P2P payment platforms. Yet the main difference between Cash App and its competitors lies in its Bitcoin transactions and growing lending schemes.

BitGo – Institutional Digital Asset Custody Firm

BitGo operates in the crypto-sector as a security and digital-asset trust firm. Showing its intent to compete, they have recently announced the acquisition of “Excess Specie Insurance”, enabling users to purchase their own dedicated excess limits above BitGo’s $100 million insurance policy, ensuring an additional layer of protection to crypto holdings. Until recently, BitGo was covering up to $100 million worth of digital assets held in their accounts with the security firms, but is now backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs and Galaxy Digital Ventures.

One distinctive feature offered by BitGo is ‘Wrapped Bitcoin’, an ERC-20 token with a 1-1 peg to Bitcoin. It currently secures 46,000 BTC, worth more than $500 million through custodial patchwork. Yet the Palo Alto-based company hasn’t stopped there; its product portfolio has expanded to offer institutional digital asset lending services. BitGo is currently lending Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and stablecoins.

In its most recent endeavour, BitGo has applied to become a qualified crypto custodian in New York State. As such, they expect “a dramatic increase in market demand for its products and services from banks, pension funds, hedge funds and other fiduciaries”, according to an announcement published on August 25th.

Yet another area of growth within the industry are gateway platforms that enable merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments in exchange for their services.

Cyclebit; Accelerating Crypto Payment Solutions For Merchants

Cyclebit is a new firm that differentiates itself by offering zero-fee tools to retailers, allowing them to accept cryptocurrencies for in-store, online, and on-the-go purchases. Cyclebit hosts 20 of the most popular cryptocurrencies, connecting merchants to a broader customer base. The company is currently processing 1 million transactions a month, featuring a $1 billion annual turnover.

Cyclebit is one of the largest mPOS and e-commerce software providers in Eastern Europe, with a range of solutions being used by the largest insurance, logistics and retail businesses in Canada, USA, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and Europe. Among the company's clients are online marketplaces, insurance and logistics companies like Ozon, Lamoda, Delivery Club, Pony Express, and DPD.

Included in its product suite is ‘Cycle-Online’, an innovative e-commerce solution for processing online crypto payments. This allows users to accept crypto payments anywhere in the world with full protection against volatility, chargebacks, and ID theft. Another solution is the tap2go application, designed to allow any Android smartphone with an NFC module to act as a terminal for receiving contactless payments. The app complies with PCI DSS Level 1 security standards, and thus has immense potential on CIS markets like Russia, where payments using Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay now make up almost 80% of all contactless transactions.

Despite the many benefits of crypto payments for merchants and consumers, including limited fees, improved privacy, and diminished reliance on centralized authorities, there remain barriers to overcome. Taxation or liquidity barriers for smaller-cap crypto projects are but two examples. What remains clear, however, is the enormous potential of the industry available for the players who enter first. For now, analysts wait in anticipation to see who will succeed.

Andrew Bailey oversaw the fintech friendly UK regulator the FCA before heading the central bank.

New global regulation is needed for payments in the face of rapidly increasing innovation, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who says crypto-assets such as bitcoin are unsuitable for consumers to use to buy and sell things.

Speaking (digitally) to the US-based think tank the Brookings Institute, said innovation is increasingly challenging regulators’ ability to ensure systemically risky firms are operating safely.

Bailey, who took over the reins from Mark Carney at the end of 2019, oversaw the UK regulator the FCA’s fintech strategy as its chief from 2016 to 2019.

Whilst he was widely seen as friendly to financial innovation Bailey is sceptical of the growing use of new payment systems operating outside of regulation.

“We have reached the point in the cycle of innovation in payments where it is essential that we set the standards and thus the expectations for how innovation will take effect,” he said.

“We must...set standards early on so that innovation can take place with confidence on what will be required. It should not happen the other way round, with the standard setting playing catch up,” he added.

“The answer is not to strangle innovation, and it does therefore require a strong dialogue between the parties, which I think we have.”

Crypto assets such as bitcoin, Bailey says, “have no connection at all to money”.

“They may have extrinsic value – you may like to collect them for instance, and as such, they are a highly risky investment opportunity. Their value can fluctuate quite wildly, unsurprisingly. They strike me as unsuited to the world of payments, where certainty of value matters,” he said.

Bradley Rice, senior regulatory lawyer at law firm Ashurst, says there could also be hurdles in the way for e-money providers

“[This could be] in the form of increased regulatory protection to bring certain e-money providers more in line with deposit takers,” he said.

Rice says the BOE is positioning itself at the forefront of the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies ""

""Ultimately, there is no way a Central Bank or Government is going to give up control of monetary policy and its reserve currency to the private sector, especially if they are not even located in the UK (or anywhere, with some decentralised systems). This is a marathon and we have a long way to go, but the Bank may be forced to sprint if it doesn't keep pace.""

Here you can read the full speech 'Reinventing the wheel (with more automation)'.",,https://ledgerinsights.com/russia-restrict-circulation-cryptocurrency/,"Russia’s Ministry of Finance is proposing legislation to restrict the circulation of cryptocurrencies, according to Russian news outlet Izvestia. The Ministry wants to amend the Digital Financial Assets (DFA) Law, which was passed in July and comes into effect next January.

The DFA Law focused more on enabling digital securities and tokens but also defined digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. At the time, it was expected a separate federal law would regulate the circulation of cryptocurrencies. But it appears the Ministry believes this route will be quicker.

While it seemed for a while that Russia was not going to outright ban cryptocurrencies, this newest proposal involves substantial restrictions. The Ministry of Finance’s proposed amendment to the federal law will make cryptocurrency miners unable to receive payment in the form of cryptocurrencies. However, producing crypto assets will still be permitted, which means miners who are part of a pool could receive fiat currency payment.

Additionally, an ‘outright’ ban on all virtual money transactions is proposed. Citizens who illegally circulate and transact with digital money may face a fine up to 100,000 rubles ($1,324) or seven years in prison. In contrast, legal entities may face a penalty of up to 1 million ($13,240).

However, there are three exceptions: inheritance, bankruptcy, and enforcement proceedings.

Legally, there appears to be considerable confusion amongst lawyers and even other Ministries. The Ministry of Economic Development raised concerns over the potential loss to Russia’s economy with transactions pushed offshore. In another example, digital reward point solutions could be included. Hence, revisions to the draft legislation are expected.

India also attempted to restrict the circulation of cryptocurrencies, but without passing legislation. Instead, the central bank imposed restrictions, which meant cryptocurrency exchanges couldn’t use bank accounts. The Supreme Court overturned the central bank’s ban and exchanges started to trade. However, it’s still expected that legislation will be enacted.",2020-09-04 10:40:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/alameda-research-wrapped-bitcoin-august-compound,"Disclosure

However, in the midst of all the troubles, at least one thing has been flourishing in these trying times: cryptocurrencies. The financial world is a mass of crazy ups and downs right now but cryptocurrency as a whole keeps trending up. It is the perfect financial vehicle for these times of volatile change and the uncertain future ahead. If you are interested in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon or are already on it and looking for what may be ahead, here are five cryptocurrency trends to watch in 2020.

Continued rise in popularity

The biggest trend in cryptocurrency to watch in 2020 is a consistent direction upward. That is the way cryptocurrency is headed in 2020 and beyond. There is a lot to like about cryptocurrencies and in 2020, they are clearly gaining importance around the world. Cryptocurrency is more secure than fiat currency. It is more private. It isn’t backed (or manipulated) by a central bank or government. It also is not subject to the mountains of fees that financial institutions attach to traditional currency.

The biggest reason cryptocurrency is growing in popularity is that it provides simple answers to all the biggest problems with currency as we know it. But, that’s not all. It is becoming one of the easiest ways to conduct international transactions, a major consideration in our increasingly globalized society. It also is volatile which some may look at as a negative but many traders and investors see this as a new, exciting frontier with huge profits to be made in a short amount of time. Cryptocurrency lovers all have their own reasons for loving it but what can’t be denied is that more people are in that category all the time.

Proliferation of new currencies

In addition to the increased popularity creating new crypto fans all the time, people are beginning to see the potential in this market and are creating new cryptocurrencies all the time. In 2009, there was one cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Nine years later, that number has jumped to just under 2,000. Today, in 2020, that number has more than doubled : there are over 5,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. Companies, governments, and entrepreneurs are all trying to get into this trend and create their own cryptocurrency that can take the world by storm like bitcoin.

New cryptocurrencies are appearing seemingly every day and the major trading platforms are adding new cryptos all the time. Many of these new currencies will come and go but there are big hits as well. In June 2020, Compound released a new cryptocurrency and in the first week, it rocketed to a $2 billion valuation. Even smaller new currencies have found love from investors, though. Not everyone can buy bitcoin at its 5-figure price tag so new cryptos that start small with the potential to grow are exciting too.

Day trading of cryptocurrencies

The quarantine that has resulted from the global pandemic has created an army of day traders around the world. While the majority are flocking to the stock market, many of smart and adventurous day traders are gravitating to the cryptocurrency market. According to Cove Markets, cryptocurrencies are particularly attractive to day traders for a variety of reasons. Traders have access to markets 24/7, different types of cryptocurrencies to trade, and different ways to trade them.

The biggest reason cryptocurrencies lend themselves to day trading so well is the volatility. Day trading is all about making (usually) small profits in a short amount of time. The way cryptocurrency fluctuates, opportunities for enormous profits appear in a very short amount of time. Of course, There is also the opportunity for big losses, so investors and day traders have to be careful. If you do your research, though, and pick the right coins, crypto day trading can be very lucrative.

More practical uses

When you talk to, listen to, or read the cryptocurrency naysayers, you will hear the same refrain over and over again. They say that cryptocurrency is all speculative and only has perceived value. Critics say it is just a fad because you can’t spend it like cash. In 2020 this is changing in a big way. More companies are getting involved with cryptocurrencies and letting consumers use it as a form of payment. Companies like Microsoft, Overstock.com, AT&T, and BMW have all put systems in place (either their own or with a third-party) where they now accept cryptocurrency as payment.

The original crypto, bitcoin, has been around long enough now that it is starting to gain real value and staying power. Even though it is still volatile compared to fiat currency, it is stabilizing a bit as the financial markets start to understand it more. Stablecoins, a cryptocurrency that is backed by some sort of tangible asset is growing and makes sense as a crypto with purchasing power. Some experts believe that if Libra, the Facebook cryptocurrency, gets off the ground soon, it could be a game-changer for people using cryptocurrency in everyday life.

Regulation is coming

As mentioned above, cryptocurrency is secure, anonymous and free from financial and government regulation. Many investors love these factors about cryptocurrency but so do criminals. Cryptocurrency has become very popular with criminals and terrorist organizations thanks to all the privacy features. To help stop this and lend some level of oversight to the current Wild West feel of the cryptocurrency markets, state governments around the U.S. are starting to put regulations on cryptocurrency. The federal government and other governments around the world are sure to follow in 2020 and beyond.

Whether these regulations are truly being placed on cryptocurrency for the stated purpose of thwarting criminals from using it remains up for debate. Many cryptocurrency fans will tell you that this story is just a cover for governments to get their piece of the cryptocurrency pie and exert more control. Either way, the regulation trend is something to watch in 2020.

Conclusion

In 2020, cryptocurrency is entering its second decade of existence. It is becoming more popular, mainstream, practical, and regulated now. Where it goes from here is anyone’s guess but watching these trends, it is sure to be interesting.",2020-09-04 16:24:58+00:00,https://www.interactivecrypto.com/discover-10-cryptos-that-are-following-the-market,"September 4, 2020 |

Tron soared as the genesis mining of the new SUN tokens was confirmed, and it kept rallying with JustSwap’s arguable change in trading volume numbers. Unsurprisingly Ethereum gas fees went up again to an all-time high – and then it doubled. Speaking of ETH, a researcher warned that a market for it might get significantly tighter.

In rest of the news: Bithumb was found partially liable for the 2017 data leak but absolved of blame in two larger claims, and then it came out that its headquarters were being searched. Hacking of PM Modi happened at a really bad time for Indian crypto industry, the Russian Ministry of Finance wants to ban crypto miners from receiving token rewards, South Africa might impose tighter crypto tax rules, and we learned that North Korea’s stolen bitcoin loot move is ‘just a tip of the iceberg’.

And your weekend crypto movie. Enjoy!",,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/the-crypto-daily-movers-and-shakers-september-5th-2020-670698,"It was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin fell to an early morning low $10,095 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $9,620, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high $10,644.0.

Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $11,090, Bitcoin eased back to sub-$10,500 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend.

Crypto banking platform Cashaa has unveiled plans to expand its services in India, the U.S., Africa, and the Caribbean. In India, the company aims to create “the first crypto-friendly banking platform” that is regulated by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Cashaa’s CEO has shared with news.Bitcoin.com.

Cashaa Unveils Expansion Plans

London-based crypto-friendly banking platform Cashaa has unveiled its expansion plans, having raised $5 million from Dubai-based blockchain investment and advisory firm O1ex. “As a part of its expansion plans, Cashaa is set to launch its global banking services,” the company announced Wednesday.

Cashaa CEO Kumar Gaurav told news.Bitcoin.com: “At the onset, we are looking at fast-maturing markets such as India, which has tremendous potential in terms of not only having a sturdy economic base but a healthy banking and financial ecosystem backed by technology. A market that has the potential of adding 100 million users within the next 2 years.”

He noted that in India Cashaa is “already the largest liquidity provider and offshore bankers for most of the major crypto exchanges,” elaborating:

We will soon launch our neobank that will enable crypto-friendly banking in India, regulated under the Reserve Bank of India.

“This is a bold move and will require a lot of back and forth between the stakeholders,” he continued, adding that his company already provides GBP, EUR, and USD business accounts to customers. With the Indian expansion, INR business accounts will also be available.

India’s cryptocurrency market has been growing rapidly ever since the country’s supreme court quashed the RBI circular that banned financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. India currently does not have any direct crypto regulations, but there are rumors of the government discussing the bill submitted by the inter-ministerial committee headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, which seeks to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. However, the Indian crypto industry firmly believes that this bill is outdated and will not be the one the government introduces.

“The Indian government is currently engaging with various stakeholders and trying to work out a solution. India today stands at a juncture, where it can actually embrace the digital currency ecosystem as it is pushing for the digital revolution and is leading the way in the fintech segment,” Gaurav opined.

Cashaa will also focus on the U.S. next year, the CEO explained. “We have already started issuing USD accounts regulated by the Banking Division of Colorado to our existing business customers as beta users,” he further shared with news.Bitcoin.com, adding that some crypto clients already using Cashaa’s USD accounts include Nexo, Coindcx, and Unocoin.

Besides India and the U.S., Gaurav said, “Africa and the Caribbean islands are in our purview.” Citing that most African nations face political instability and many people have lost faith in their local currencies, he confirmed:

We are also going to explore Africa and the Caribbean islands in 2021.

“These islands are heavily dependent on markets that trade in USD. Now Cashaa is the right fit to step into these islands and help their banking systems by providing solutions,” the CEO emphasized.

Cashaa’s platform currently supports bitcoin, Cashaa’s native token, ethereum, and tether. “Other leading cryptocurrencies such as ripple, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and EOS will be added in 2021,” the company detailed in Wednesday’s announcement. It also claimed that more than 100 crypto companies are already using the beta version of its banking system and over 1,500 crypto companies worldwide are waiting to be onboarded. Furthermore, Cashaa announced that it will use some of the funds raised to cover the losses from the July Delhi hack.

These platforms can democratize access and promote widespread economic inclusion in previously inaccessible markets. They have worked wonders in myriad verticals already — e.g., stock exchanges — and the world of digital asset liquidity may now be fertile ground for this business model.

Successful new platforms bring together buyers and sellers who would otherwise be unable to connect, creating entirely new value streams for sellers who capture more revenue. Meanwhile, buyers gain access to new capabilities, creating a win-win for everyone involved. A CoreSight research indicated that revenue of two-sided markets such as Airbnb, Fiverr, eBay and Uber could exceed $40 billion by 2022.

Google’s AdSense is a great example of how a two-sided marketplace can create an entirely new source of value for buyers and sellers. Its solution benefiting both publishers and advertisers has helped accelerate the growth of a new business category and built an industry-leading business. The Google Ads advertising service collected $134.8 billion in 2019 (including AdSense as well as Google’s other advertising products). Over 11 million websites have become AdSense users (sellers). Google has generated new sources of demand for advertising inventory on high-traffic websites by making ad space accessible to legions of smaller advertisers (buyers), leading to higher bids, more ads and higher ad sales.

AdSense made it possible for websites of all sizes to monetize their audiences by easily selling ad space. On top of that, AdWords helped small businesses needing an easy way to advertise to gain fast access to a previously inaccessible world. What had once required a team of media buyers and big budgets for TV, radio or print promotion was suddenly achievable via a few clicks and affordable pricing.

Crypto’s unexpected challenges

The creators of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) founded their creations in large part on a philosophy of financial empowerment. Bitcoin’s genesis as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system was designed to enable consumers to pay each other directly, accurately and securely via a blockchain’s immutable audit trail.

Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, probably didn’t foresee that in a little more than a decade, Bitcoin would achieve over a $200-billion market cap. Satoshi probably also wouldn’t have predicted the appearance of countless new cryptocurrencies, which have been accompanied by hundreds of digital asset exchanges worldwide where investors could trade digital assets.

As new exchanges have sprouted up around the globe — each built in a disconnected silo — market fragmentation has increased exponentially. Ironically, this market fragmentation has prevented liquidity aggregation even as the overall market capitalization has grown. As a result, exchanges today face deep challenges in guaranteeing price/time priority of orders, reasonable spreads and transaction speed. This liquidity bottleneck is a drag on digital asset trading growth.

All-access

Markets must necessarily mature and reach critical mass before a two-sided platform can arrive on the scene. Crypto trading today has arrived at this juncture: With more exchanges and more traders, the demand for liquidity has continued to grow.

I believe that a two-sided market-making platform will be the solution to this problem. Crypto exchanges depend on market makers to commit to buying and selling at pre-chosen prices. These orders add liquidity to the exchange, benefiting an exchange’s clients. Meanwhile, the liquidity providers (aka market makers) must have the means to commit the required trading volume and capital. Their reward can be high, as market makers have the opportunity to capture the difference, or the spread, between their lower-priced buy and higher-priced sell orders.

Market makers not only require capital but also need technology and trading expertise to inform automated trading algorithms. While market making could potentially be an attractive use of capital for smaller players, they are shut out because they either lack the capital, trading volume, or expertise to participate.

Just like AdSense, a two-sided market-making marketplace platform would enable traders, big and small, to commit digital assets to specific exchanges and trading pairs (like publishers in the AdSense model dedicating ad inventory). Meanwhile, exchanges “bid” on this trading volume with fees paid to market makers (like advertisers in Adsense). While market making has traditionally been the domain of full-time, well-capitalized professional traders, an AdSense-like two-sided marketplace can expand that domain to include skilled traders of virtually all shapes and sizes.

Market maker metamorphosis

What if a platform could enable savvy retail investors to serve as crypto market makers by connecting them with digital asset exchanges and/or asset pairs that need more liquidity? A well-designed two-sided platform can empower retail investors to diversify and participate in a vital market function previously unavailable to them.

In the future, a two-sided platform could enable exchanges and asset issuers to list their market-making opportunities on the platform, along with the corresponding maker rewards. Retail investors could place funds into a market-making account, allocate it to a participating digital asset exchange, and select their preferred trading pairs, such as BTC/USD.

As each exchange’s liquidity increases, their clients will enjoy better price discovery, trade execution and higher fill rates. Better execution may even help exchanges attract more institutional investors, creating a virtuous cycle of market growth.

Turning an investor or a trader into a market maker may seem like a tall order, but a well-designed, two-sided marketplace makes it quite feasible. It isn’t far-fetched to suggest that such an efficient platform can spark one giant leap forward for the digital asset ecosystem.

Developers have been catching mission-critical bugs in the code ever since.

“This is the biggest testnet launch that Ethereum 2.0 has seen… So we learned about things that were frustrating for people. We found some bugs. We’ve been troubleshooting a very interesting and elusive bug at the moment that can cause nodes to crash,” said Paul Hauner, the lead developer of the Ethereum 2.0 Lighthouse client.

Also testing the new Eth 2.0 mock network – called “Medalla” – and finding some surprises along the way is staking-as-a-service startup Staked. In the mind of Tim Ogilvie, co-founder and CEO of Staked, all of the bugs and unexpected issues on the Medalla network thus far are relatively minor and give no cause for concern.

“We run 25 other proof-of-stake networks and so we’re used to running in testnets,” Ogilvie said. “We see a lot of the same issues in testnets, which is that sometimes the software doesn’t communicate perfectly or has issues where the network needs to be restarted. I think [Eth 2.0] is in pretty good shape relative to a lot of the other testnets we’ve seen.”

That said, both Hauner and Ogilvie agree there are important features about the Eth 2.0 network that users need to understand before staking their ETH.

A “really important one,” according to Ogilvie, is the fact that once ETH is transferred to the Eth 2.0 network, it cannot be transferred back to the original Ethereum blockchain.

“It is a one-way trip until the next phase [of Ethereum 2.0 development] has been enabled. Your funds are not liquid. Really, the only thing you can do is participate in staking. People have to understand that fundamentally before they get started,” Ogilvie said.",2020-09-05 14:00:00+00:00,https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-burning-man-in-the-rose-garden-millennial-crypto-king-wants-to-win-the-white-house-1.9127793,"Charismatic and energetically underslept, Brock Pierce is the most famous person you’ve never heard of. A child actor turned internet mogul, and a regular fixture of everything bitcoin since it was little more than a nerdy gimmick, the 39-year-old serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist, who may or may not be a billionaire, has a devoted following among aficionados of the cryptocurrency technology.

He has a colorful and divisive personality. Those who love him adore him. The others move between indifference and irritation. On July 4, hours after fellow bitcoin enthusiast Kanye West did the same, Pierce announced he would be running for the presidency of the United States.

Two weeks later, he made his way to the nation’s capital, via New York, to kick off his campaign in earnest. Born in Minnesota, he currently lives between Puerto Rico – a territory of the United States and a tax haven that he hopes to turn into the Singapore of the Caribbean – and Los Angeles. On his trip to the East Coast, he flew in with one of his rabbis to New York.

“I have a number of rabbis that I spend time with,” says Pierce, smiling, in a video interview with Haaretz the next morning. “I spend time with spiritual advisers. I also confer with indigenous elders; I come from a family of ministers. I’m a faith-based guy.”

Pierce’s latest investment is the former Pierce School, apparently the largest penthouse in D.C., which he bought sight unseen from an NBA player for $2 million. For him, this acquisition is additional proof that he is serious, that he is in national politics for the long run, not just for 2020, but to build a proper movement.

“My intention is to build out the platform necessary to support independent candidates up and down the ticket. We only need a handful of people in Congress, even less so in the Senate, to be truly independent, and then we have the swing vote,” says Pierce.

Pierce thinks the two-party system is broken, and that the rise of partisan politics “is accelerating.” With his campaign team, he has designed a winning strategy. If he wins any three states, he says, then he can make sure that neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump can secure enough votes in the Electoral College, forcing Congress to decide the election. He thinks a small number of congressional seats in a very divided American polity can serve as a magnet for both sides of the spectrum to come together. And in order to do this, he banks on the youth.

Socratic learning

Politicians are out of touch with reality today, Pierce argues. He calls himself a millennial; and, at least in some shape or form, the former child actor is the closest a 39-year-old can be to a digital native. Public oversight and regulation of technology is a major issue in U.S. politics today, but one that neither Trump nor Biden look likely to approach with competence. And it’s not just them, as the latest congressional debates around regulation of the game-streaming platform Twitch show.

“We need leadership that understands technology and its impact on our lives,” Pierce says. “The government doesn’t really understand what’s happening in real time. They’re reactive, they’re kind of looking back in the rear-view mirror, and seeing what happened over the last five or 10 years. It’s very hard to be effective when you don’t see what the future looks like.”

On the walls of one of his new lair’s airy living rooms, interior designers have chosen to keep the former school’s blackboards, and for Pierce, who could coerce a narrative out of one piece of chalk and two pixels, this is the perfect space to showcase his method. “We come together here to learn Socratically by sharing, listening, to bring together a nation divided,” he says.

“We’re living in this sort of broadcast era, where government and media talk down to us, and tell us what to think and what to do,” he continues. “But, through the youth, we’re entering this collaborative era where some people – not everyone – feel as if they have a voice and feel like they can participate in the conversation. The goal is to nurture that, because that creates a much healthier future for all of us.

I have a number of rabbis that I spend time with. I spend time with spiritual advisers. I also confer with indigenous elders; I come from a family of ministers. I’m a faith-based guy. Pierce

“I believe we’ll break the record of youth registering and then following through and actually voting” for him, Pierce boasts. How, you may ask? One thing he has in his favor is the power of social media. His achievement of the day is his apparent brokerage of a deal between a group of major influencers on the Chinese-owned social video app TikTok and its L.A.-based competitor Triller. These four young bright things (Triller’s new head of strategy is only 18) have an audience of tens of millions, and would facilitate the migration of users from TikTok, which faces the wrath of Donald Trump and might be banned altogether in the United States.

Apart from mentoring teenage influencers, Pierce wants to open his political platform so it is attractive and relevant to young voters and to crowdsource the knowledge necessary to make it as representative as possible of the nation’s needs and expectations. He doesn’t hesitate to admit that he’s not an expert on politics – “the presidency is an office, it is not a person,” he repeats often – and has not said much on the issues he’s not comfortable with. That does not prevent him from taking what some would consider to be radical views: for example, on military aid to Israel and U.S. interventionism in foreign countries.

“Do you think this practice of intervention is serving the United States and the world at large?” Pierce asks rhetorically. “We push ideas but do not evaluate their efficacy. We suffer from the law of unintended consequences, but do not change anything.”

“Sometimes it feels like we’re going through a forest with a machete, chopping away, chopping away, but at some point someone has to climb up a tree and make sure we’re going in the right direction,” he adds. “I believe that everything should always be on the table – although by no means am I saying we should be taking support away from Israel.”

The campaign goes to great lengths to tout a libertarian, but rather progressive agenda. While Pierce is unlikely to win a huge number of votes, there is a chance he could shave off a few percentage points from Biden in the eight states, plus Washington, D.C., where he’s managed to make it onto the ballot. His stances in support of the legalization of cannabis and universal basic income, and of the need to address climate change should appeal to left-wing voters, as will his campaign’s personnel.

His choice for vice president is tech entrepreneur Karla Ballard, a Black woman who also happens to be a descendant of Founding Father Aaron Burr. His campaign manager, Brittany Kaiser, became famous as a Cambridge Analytica executive-turned-whistleblower, turned data-privacy activist. His newly announced chief strategist is none other than the Senegalese-American, Grammy-winning singer Akon, famous for hits like “Smack That,” and for recently laying the first stone for his own futuristic smart city – a real-life Wakanda, he calls it – in Senegal.

And yet, all this contrasts heavily with Pierce’s attendance at an August 2019 fundraiser at the Southampton, Long Island, home of Stephen Ross, a friend of Donald Trump, where Pierce donated $100,000 directly to the president’s re-election campaign. A request for comment on this specific issue went unanswered.

Battle scars

“I have a pretty good track record of disrupting the systems that I focus on,” Pierce says. Disruption as a concept is a major part of the blockchain industry – or blockchain “space,” as those in the know call it – in which he plays a major role. Blockchain, often puzzling to the uninitiated, is fundamentally an immutable record of transactions, called “blocks.” Added to one another, they create a chain, which guarantees that the records cannot be modified.

We need leadership that understands technology and its impact on our lives. The government doesn’t really understand what’s happening in real time. It’s very hard to be effective when you don’t see what the future looks like. Pierce

Blockchain has attracted much investment, with supporters saying that it has the potential to be the basis for a new, better internet and revolutionize everything, from banking to identity. There have been a few successes, including as a decentralized payment system for refugees who lack bank accounts. But despite the billions funneled into its development, venture capitalists have not as yet managed to find an appropriate solution to blockchain’s substantial energy footprint.

For now, blockchain remains a synonym for bitcoin and cryptocurrency, which some experts say is nothing but a scam. David Gerard, a cryptocurrency critic and author of “Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain,” calls it a “complicated game of bullshit.”

“The whole thing is based on the fact that if you keep repeating something, it’ll come true,” Gerard tells Haaretz.

Pierce is a mover and shaker in the blockchain world, and has been behind many of the major milestones that have taken it from nerdy pastime to a legitimate subject of serious conversation. Transplanting these talents to politics, he knows he has little chance of being elected – but is already looking forward to 2022, and 2024. Besides that, in an industry where everything is about hype, he has just given his brand a major boost, potentially distracting attention from the multiple controversies that he’s had to contend with over the years. “I’m not perfect – God knows I have the battle scars to prove it,” his online “Brock Pierce for President 2020” campaign spot says.

He could be referring to the many scandals that have plagued his career. His teenage association with digital-streaming pioneer and convicted pedophile Marc Collins-Rector in the late 1990s led to dismissals from companies he helped to found, including Block.one, which made headlines in 2018 for raising a whopping $4 billion dollars in order to build a cryptocurrency called EOS. (Pierce has never been convicted of any sexual abuse himself.) There are also ties to several cases of embezzlement and securities fraud related to the major cryptocurrency projects he was instrumental in establishing, some of which are ongoing.

Steve Bannon, too

In 2001, with support from Collins-Rector, Pierce founded Internet Gaming Entertainment, a company that built on a discovery that money can be made from selling virtual goods inside video games. He relocated to Hong Kong, eventually employing thousands across China – in what The New York Times called “virtual sweatshops” – playing games like Everquest and World of Warcraft. He hired the employees to find potentially valuable goods, or artifacts, in the game, to later trade for actual currency.

According to a 2018 portrait in Rolling Stone, Pierce brought Bannon into the business in 2005, together with an investment of $60 million from Goldman Sachs. And whether this was Pierce’s aim or not, what Bannon found in IGE – later renamed Affinity Media – was another resource altogether: disaffected, young, male gamers, who would come to form the core of the alt-right movement that Bannon later spearheaded.

On the surface, Bannon’s political approach is far from what Brock Pierce preaches. Technology is neither good nor bad, in Pierce’s opinion. He embraces the kind of transhumanist, libertarian thinking that permeates the U.S. high-tech elite: Technology has the power to save us all, as long as we know how to use it. We only need more entrepreneurs, more innovators. In Puerto Rico, Pierce dreamed of creating a “nation of entrepreneurs.”

But it is more than that. He also swears by the radical thinking of the Burning Man 10 Principles of community – an ethos that unites the thousands of revelers who gather to live currency-free in a sort of post-apocalyptic desert setting every year (although not in 2020).

The 10 Principles, among them radical inclusion, decommodification and radical transparency, draw an attractive picture of a color-blind, inclusive future where only human potential informs success. They are the epitome of a brave new world in which all wounds will be healed and technology will serve the greater good of humanity, where progress rewards creativity, and everyone can get rich.

“Technology should really be embraced, not feared. It is here to enhance our institutions, and improve our lives,” Pierce says in his campaign ad, wearing relaxed formal wear and ascending an ivy-laden staircase.

He raises a cup of coffee to his lips. It’s 9 A.M. in Washington, and the August sun is shining brightly. His cup sports the inscription “Let the adventure begin.” It probably wasn’t chosen randomly. Like any other politician, Pierce is an actor. In fact, he’s already spent time in the White House: as a fictional “First Kid” in the 1996 film of that name, in which he starred alongside comedian Sinbad, who played his bodyguard.

Whatever happens on November 3, Pierce, who turns 40 ten days later, plans to be in Israel for his birthday. This time, unlike on past trips, he hopes to visit Jerusalem.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-leverage-uniswap-ethereums-noncustodial-defi-trading-platform/,"How to Leverage Uniswap - Ethereum's Noncustodial Defi Trading Platform

In 2020 decentralized exchanges (dex) have grown quite mature compared to just a few years ago. One specific dex gathering a lot of steam this year in the defi world is Uniswap, a trading platform that held $1.3 billion locked in value and dominated most defi applications by over 18% Friday evening. The following review is a detailed explainer of what Uniswap is and how to leverage the dex using an Ethereum wallet like Metamask.

**Price quotes, TVL, and defi dominance percentages from this Uniswap review were recorded on Friday evening, September 4, 2020.

Ethereum Dex Uniswap Shatters Records

Decentralized finance (defi) has been all the rage and one feature the economy has amplified is the use of decentralized exchanges. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the massive dex trade volumes that have been taking place recently, and this week has been no different.

On Friday evening, stats from Dune Analytics indicate that dex platforms have continued to surge in volume with seven-day growth at 178%. During the last week, dex platforms have surpassed $7.1 billion in global swaps and $968 million in the last 24 hours.

The dex protocol Uniswap is the most dominant trading platform. Uniswap eclipses most of the dex contenders with 71.9% of the aggregate dex trade volume globally. Over 91,000 traders were active on Uniswap on Friday evening. Defipulse.com stats show Uniswap also dominated by more than 18% of the defi economy with $1.3 billion total-value locked (TVL) at its height. In recent days, Uniswap’s trading volume outpaced the centralized exchange Coinbase Pro as well.

Uniswap’s creator Hayden Adams developed the dex after being inspired by an Ethereum Research post written by Vitalik Buterin. Essentially Uniswap is an Ethereum exchange built by leveraging smart contracts and liquidity pools, in contrast to a traditional centralized exchange’s order book. In the past, older crypto dex platforms had liquidity issues, but Uniswap’s liquidity pool model changed the game. The web portal Ethhub.io also offers a comprehensive “Graphical Guide for Understanding Uniswap,” which shows a visual representation of how the app works.

With a decent Ethereum wallet, users can simply connect to Uniswap’s application and trustlessly swap ERC20 tokens in an effortless manner. The application allows users to not only swap the coins, but they can also create any type of ERC20 pool or provide an existing pool with liquidity and earn funds. Uniswap allows anyone from anywhere to swap coins in a permissionless fashion without needing an ID or going through a cumbersome KYC process.

How to Use Uniswap With Metamask

Accessing Uniswap is easy and relatively simple to understand. If one already knows the very basics of leveraging ethereum (ETH) and wallets like Metamask, then Uniswap is fairly intuitive. Essentially the first thing to do is make sure you have an Ethereum wallet and one that can interact with ETH smart contracts. Metamask works well for most defi applications with its Chrome browser extension, but it also launched a new mobile wallet this week.

Uniswap’s two features allow people to either add liquidity to a pool or trade ERC20s for ETH or other ERC20 tokens. So if you want to use the dex, it’s also a good idea to have some ETH-based tokens or just ether deposited into your Metamask wallet.

From here simply head over to Uniswap and connect your wallet to the Version 2 (V2) application. Metamask will ask you to accept the permissions in order to tether the wallet to the Uniswap application. Simply confirm with Metamask and you can now see your balance of ETH or tokens in the app’s user interface window. Throughout every action, Metamask makes sure the owner of the funds authorizes all the Uniswap transactions.

If you choose the “Swap” feature, the application asks you to choose from a list of tokens tethered to applications like Aave or Compound in the V2 software.

“Uniswap now supports token lists,” the software will tell you. “You can add your own custom list via IPFS, HTTPS, and ENS.” From here you can “choose a list” like the “Aave Token List” or others like “CMC Defi.” After choosing a list, you can then choose the type of token you want to trade and the token you want to leverage to buy it.

If you have ETH in your Metamask wallet simply choose the crypto asset in the “from” section and Uniswap will show the balance. Then you can choose which type of token you want to obtain, as the list of tokens is quite extensive. Uniswap supports any ETH-based token and perusing through the list you will notice popular assets like DAI, WBTC, BAT, USDT, USDC, LEND, MANA, MKR, TUSD, and many more. In the “to” selection, select the token you want and Uniswap will explain the exchange rate.

For instance, I had a balance of 0.120333 ETH and selected the stablecoin DAI for my trade. I press “max” (using my entire Metamask balance of ETH) and Uniswap will tell me the price of the trade. Selecting DAI for my 0.120333 ETH ($42 on 9/5/20) will get me 38.3549 DAI and that doesn’t include the network fee to swap.

At the time of writing ETH fees are between 450 to 550 gwei or $3.36 to $4.11 per transaction. Metamask will explain to you how much the gas fee will be when executing the Uniswap trade. Following the network confirmations, the coins purchased will be deposited into your Metamask wallet.

With the other feature called “Pool” you can add liquidity to certain pools in the Uniswap ecosystem and earn a percentage of trading fees for supplying funds to the pool. Simply press “add liquidity,” choose a token input and Uniswap will explain the prices pool shares.

For instance, if I add an ETH input and 26.86 MANA, Uniswap details the price of ETH per MANA and the pool share which is 0.01%. Of course, those who add massive amounts of liquidity get a much larger pool share of trading fees than those who only add small fractions of funds.

Just like most of the defi applications out there today, the very basics of Uniswap’s features are pretty easy to use. However, gas fees at $3-4 per transaction make the experience less pleasant and ETH fees were even higher just a few days ago.

Besides the obvious ETH fee issue, Uniswap allows for quick trades in a noncustodial fashion and removes the horrid KYC processes depressing the crypto industry today. This privacy is the most refreshing benefit of the experience. For some more perspective, the video below created by the Youtuber, “Every Bit Helps,” also gives individuals a visual step-by-step on how to leverage the Uniswap protocol.

Non-financial incentives are important for building long-lasting decentralized communities.

Several yield farming schemes this summer have made many users rich. But when it comes time to vote on protocol improvements with their newly-earned governance tokens, many farmers have been silent.

The idea of liquidity mining assumes that reward tokens are used to steward the evolution of DeFi protocols. But the sector’s obsession with profit poses challenges to this assumption.

The example of Curve DAO shows that users aren’t willing to stick with the project after receiving short-term gains. Consequently, only a handful of large players are left to govern the project, which creates an environment for hostile power grabs.

The issue is not Curve-specific; its roots are in the community itself. Human nature eagerly seeks the path of least resistance on its way to riches. Hence, DAOs should find ways to harness greed for the benefit of their protocols.

Misalignment of Incentives

While the DeFi platforms have been growing since 2018, their popularity exploded after Compound launched its governance token COMP on Jun. 16, 2020.

The introduction of COMP ignited the yield farming movement, where users provide liquidity to help the lending function for rewards. Curve followed the same path with its CRV token.

The overarching idea of decentralizing Curve’s governance is to give tokens to liquidity providers through inflation, as stated in the protocol’s guide:

“The circulating supply at the end of year one should be around 750m CRV. The rate of inflation is there to help put the DAO’s control in the hands of liquidity providers on the Curve Finance protocol.”

By giving out governance tokens, the team distributes control over the network. Users can lock their CRV in the system to influence Curve’s future by proposing ideas or voting for other proposals.

However, holders of CRV bear an opportunity cost when they lock-up their tokens because tokens are tradable. If the price moves up or down, the tokens are stuck in the protocol and can only be sold or bought after spending hefty gas fees to remove them from lock-up. Besides, high inflation will negatively affect CRV’s price in the upcoming years.

Consequently, using rewards for governance means passing up on lucrative gains.

In reality, Curve’s governance model shows that users prefer instant profits over having a say in the project’s governance. After farming the CRV, rarely do liquidity providers lock up their tokens.

The Curve Cartel

Low governance participation is not unique to Curve, but that doesn’t change the outcome—it makes power grabs easy.

The first Curve DAO war occurred on Aug. 23, when the project’s CEO, Michael Egorov, captured over 70% of the DAO’s voting power. As Egorov commented, he “over-reacted“ to balance out the growing influence of yEarn, lead by Andre Cronje.

Egorov’s intervention put the DAO in a predicament.

Voting on the platform requires a 30% quorum, so the founder has to participate in the voting process. Hence, he theoretically could influence decisions on the platform in his favor. While in reality, Egorov acted professionally, the situation showed how a single actor could easily hijack the DAO.

The second war was connected to CRV inflation. The protocol distributes inflation across its liquidity pools according to how users vote each week. By having substantial voting power, a large player can direct the majority of inflation to a pool of their liking.

On Aug. 26, almost 50% of the CRV inflation was proposed to go to the sBTC pool. However, the distribution changed dramatically in favor of the Y pool shortly after.

The rapid shift in the votes’ distribution not only confirms that Curve’s DAO is small and volatile but also shows that financial incentives are the key influential factor in the platform’s governance.

yEarn and Y pool dominate the governance because they offer lucrative rewards. Notably, the rewards come from the yEarn platform instead of Curve.

When liquidity providers lock their stablecoins on Curve’s Y pool, they receive ownership tokens, which they can take outside of Curve and lock on yEarn for over 90% ROI.

By using yEarn as a proxy for earning profits, Curve’s liquidity providers form a cartel. They combine their governance power to adjust Curve in a way that maximizes yEarn’s returns, which is not necessarily beneficial for other Curve users.

Besides influence within the DAO, there’s some questionable activity coming from the outside. Namely, the team extends the product without asking for prior approval from the users.

Ideally, the Curve DAO should decide which extensions should be built and deploy capital for development. However, the recent move from Curve’s core team broke this relationship.

On Aug. 25, the team added a new pool to the platform before polling token holders, going around their governance process. After getting backlash from the community, Michael Egorov proposed on-chain voting, which technically should have been done in the first place.

At the moment of writing, the pool is still available on the platform’s UI, and users can interact with it. If the team can modify Curve at will, it undermines the DAO’s value proposition.

Can Financial Incentives Fix The Issues?

Starting from Aug. 28, 2020, Curve launched an incentive program to increase participation in the DAO. The platform offers up to 2.5x boost of the CRV rewards to those who lock enough tokens.

Keeping the boost stable, while capitalizing on the rewards, is laborious and risky. Imagine a user provides 10,000 DAI to the Y pool. She will need over 5,000 CRV under a 1-week vote lock to maximize the boost, which means risking more than $20,000 in CRV.

One way to reduce the amount of CRV needed is to extend the locking time. However, it’s not an optimal short-term strategy, as the boost is likely to change at every withdrawal of the rewards.

The system is designed to encourage long-term vote locking, as proved by one of the team’s recent responses to Andre Cronje. Long-term vote locking without withdrawing rewards should encourage users to stick with the project and contribute to its future success.

1 week lockup != being long-term aligned with the project. That is not the idea of the votelock. Btw, was 0x431 voting on behalf of yearn users? — Curve (@CurveFinance) August 23, 2020

The boost incentive worked to drive the attention of users to the DAO. The day before the incentive kicked in, the number of vote locking addresses increased seven-fold. However, the interest quickly died off, most likely because of the boost’s complexity.

Nevertheless, the inflow of new users diminished the influence of large players in the DAO, which is an encouragingly healthy dynamic.

Importantly the distribution between short and long-term vote locks is in favor of the long-term ones. The majority of the addresses locked their tokens until 2024.

The short-term effect of the boost is promising, but it may not be enough to fix low voter turnout in the long term. Despite the initial excitement, only 1,147 out of over 8,000 holders locked their CRV since the incentive started.

In a sense, farming CRV with the boost is like staking, and staking platforms suffer from low voter turnout despite providing financial incentives. Making money via short-term trading turns out to be preferable over holding tokens and going through the governance hustle.

Curve DAO is still vulnerable to oligarchy and technocracy. It needs to grow to a critical mass to balance out the team and cartels. Whether or not it will happen largely depends on the community and the introduction of other incentives.

If most of Curve’s users will merely aim for quick profits, boosting will turn into a game of musical chairs.

The team needs to find creative ways to direct greed into meaningful governance activities to mitigate this. Money can bring users to the platform, but they will need something more to stick around, something that will make them feel they are a part of the group.

Curve’s Warning Sign for Others

Curve’s example is not unique. On-chain governance is a complex topic, and there’s no flawless architecture. Still, there are some lessons other projects can learn from.

A DAOs ethos is essential. The community around a project needs to have a long-term vision and active participants to propagate this vision. In such a case, financial incentives will act as oil for a well-built machine.

In other, poorly designed schemes, the project will become a cash cow to a handful of whales and tech-savvy people.

Top Stories This Week

It’s been a bad end to an already trying week for Bitcoin. At one point, prices fell below $10,000 across major exchanges.

Overall, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency has seen its value fall by 11.7% in recent days. Most of these losses came on Thursday when a sudden drop of 7% in less than two hours wiped out $99 million worth of longs.

This coincided with sell-offs on the U.S. stock market, and it doesn’t help that the dollar has been rallying recently either. Sentiment was mixed after the plunge, with eToro analyst Simon Peters warning Bitcoin “may still have a long way to fall.”

Exactly 91 years after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index showed a seismic change in investor sentiment — changing from “greed” to “fear” within hours.

Thought the weird case about July’s Twitter hack was solved? Think again.

The FBI has executed a search warrant against a 16-year-old from Massachusetts in connection with the unprecedented breach, which compromised high-profile accounts belonging to celebrities, millionaires and presidential candidates.

Detectives have raided the teenage boy’s home amid allegations that he may have played “an equal, if not more significant role” in the hack.

It’s claimed that he may have posed as a Twitter employee or contractor to fool legitimate ones into entering their login credentials on fake websites where he could capture them.

Three others have been charged in connection with the attack — a 17-year-old and 22-year-old from Florida, and a 19-year-old from the United Kingdom.

Binance may be advertising Bitcoin at bus stops in London, but make no mistake: The Bank of England’s governor is not a fan of the cryptocurrency.

Andrew Bailey — a known crypto skeptic — has said crypto assets are “unsuited to the world of payments” as Bitcoin has “no connection at all to money.”

There was some reason to be optimistic, though. Bailey said stablecoins could offer some “useful benefits” by reducing friction in payments — as long as they operate to the same standards as fiat-based alternatives already in the market.

Also this week, it emerged that the market cap of stablecoins has been increasing by $100 million a day consistently since mid-July. The rise of DeFi protocols and demand for tokens in liquidity pools will no doubt have contributed to this.

In an interview he gave during the middle of the crypto boom in 2017, Bailey had warned: “If you want to invest in Bitcoin, be prepared to lose all your money.”

If you want to get an idea about how small crypto’s market cap is, just take a look at Apple’s.

The iPhone giant now has a valuation of $2.1 trillion — six times more than all cryptocurrencies put together at $327 billion.

All of this suggests that the crypto sector has much more room for growth in the future.

Bitcoin has had an extraordinary journey over the past 12 years — going from a price of less than $1 per coin to record highs of $20,000 in late 2017.

Perhaps Bitcoin needs a comeback like Apple had. It’s weird to think that Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy in the 1990s, so much so that it needed a cash injection from Microsoft. In 2001, the iPod and iTunes were born… and the rest is history.

One of the world’s biggest pornography sites now accepts Bitcoin and Litecoin as a payment method for premium services.



Pornhub says it is excited to get greater exposure to crypto, noting that it has 130 million visitors per day.



The company is a year older than Bitcoin and was founded in Montreal 13 years ago. Currently, it’s the ninth-most popular website in the world.



It’s safe to say that BTC’s pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, would have approved. Back in 2010, he had said: “Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don’t have a credit card or don’t want to use the cards they have, either don’t want the spouse to see it on the bill or don’t trust giving their number to ‘porn guys,’ or afraid of recurring billing.”

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $10,195.42, Ether at $340.52 and XRP at $0.23. The total market cap is at $324,953,472,998.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are BitShares, CyberVein and Flexacoin. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Ampleforth, Balancer and Aragon.

Most Memorable Quotations

“In the post-Halving bull cycles, bitcoin can often correct 25% (even 40% + in 2017), throwing off the short-term traders (or giving swing traders a shot at the short side). Each of those was a buying opportunity. DCA opportunity ahead?”

Raoul Pal, Global Macro Investor CEO

“A lot of panic selling yesterday from HODLers who were quite successful in buying tops. Their strategy seems to be – buy high sell low.”

Whalemap

“In a battle of the bulls, we see greater potential endurance favoring #gold over the #Nasdaq.”

Mike McGlone, Bloomberg senior commodity strategist

“Cryptocurrency is no longer the niche interest that it once was, but neither is it completely mainstream — it’s somewhere in the middle.”

Prediction of the Week

We love this prediction because of how there’s so much margin for error — and little chance of being proven wrong.

Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone has said Bitcoin could either be heading to the dizzying heights of $500,000, or it will fail.

In his view, Bitcoin is set to become digital gold — helped by how it has limited supply and increasing demand. McGlone has also drawn repeated comparisons to the bull run of 2017.

Crypto evangelists, including Anthony Pompliano and Tyler Winklevoss, have adamantly predicted that BTC will one day achieve parity with gold’s market cap of $9 trillion. Dividing that number by Bitcoin’s maximum supply of 21 million gets you a price of $428,571 per coin.

FUD of the Week

A new report has revealed how the Lazarus Group, a well-known hacking gang sponsored by the North Korean regime, launders its ill-gotten gains.

According to BAE Symptoms and SWIFT, Lazarus typically steals the crypto funds from an exchange and then starts to pass transactions through multiple exchanges, using something called a “layering technique.”

Facilitators from East Asia receive a portion of the proceeds for helping to launder the funds, and they’re tasked with transferring crypto across numerous addresses to “obfuscate the origin of the funds.”

The report, called “Follow The Money,” added: “Other stolen funds might be transferred in Bitcoin into prepaid gift cards, which can be used at other exchanges to purchase additional Bitcoin.”

The study noted that money laundering cases via crypto are still relatively small compared with the huge volumes of cash laundered through wire transfers.

An anti-crypto activist has used his influence as a senior Wikipedia editor to remove a blockchain-related entry about the Australian firm Power Ledger.



This isn’t the first time that David Gerard has done this. He appeared to boast about his latest victory in a blog posting, in which he claimed the deletion was “on the basis of being a pile of press release churnalism, and the only genuine press coverage was about how Power Ledger was a scam.”



Lobbying for the deletion, Gerard also took aim at the sources in the Power Ledger Wikipedia entry. He called CoinRivet a “bottom-of-the-barrel Bitcoin blog,” and also dismissed articles from India’s Economic Times and TechCrunch as “churnalism.” That phrase refers to news outlets who report on press releases without much, if any, investigation of their own.



It is worth noting that TechCrunch has 16 million readers, while The Economic Times is one of the world’s most-read English language business newspapers.

Not again. Hackers have once again taken over a high-profile Twitter account and posted messages asking followers to make crypto donations.

Who was the victim this time? Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This isn’t a good look for the crypto sector, not least because India is actively exploring ways to ban cryptocurrency.

Several tweets were posted from Modi’s account to his 2.5 million followers on Wednesday. One of them said: “Now India begin with crypto currency. Kindly Donate Bitcoin.”

Blockchain data shows no funds were sent to the addresses listed in the tweets — and the group, or person, responsible for the hack went under the name “John Wick.”

I also want to examine what volatility is not, as its specter takes on a disproportionate influence in times of turmoil.

This confusion is not unique to crypto markets – volatility is misunderstood across all asset groups. As with virtually all market metrics, however, it has particular nuances when applied to our industry.

Setting the table

First, let’s review what we mean by volatility. Technically, it is the degree to which an asset price can swing in either direction. Generally, by “volatility” we mean realized volatility, which is derived from historical prices. This can be measured in several ways – at CoinDesk we take the annualized rolling 30-day standard deviation of daily natural log returns.

Implied volatility represents market expectations of future volatility, as inferred from options prices. More on this later.

The volatility of an asset is an important part of its narrative, especially in crypto markets, which are associated with volatility in the minds of many investors. A survey of institutional investors, carried out earlier this year by Fidelity Digital Assets, singled out volatility as one of the main barriers to investment.

This is because many investors conflate volatility with risk. This is a fundamental investment error that says more about our psychological makeup than it does about our portfolio management insight.

Look inward

We are, as a species, risk-averse, and have needed to be for survival. This extends to our vocabulary – higher risk also means the possibility of higher rewards, but you don’t hear anyone claim to be reward-averse. “Risk” will forever be associated with something bad, especially when it comes to investments. Investment advisors don’t warn about “upside risk.”

Our aversion to risk when it comes to finance is understandable. Risk implies irredeemable loss, which can mean total ruin for some. Yet, the degree of our aversion is generally not compensated by the actual possible loss, especially in mature markets where downside can be managed. In other words, our fear of risk may be prudent but it is usually not rational.

Conflating volatility with risk makes the former also something to be avoided, in the minds of most investors. Yet volatility is not the same as risk. Volatility is a metric, a number, a measurement. Risk is an ambiguous concept.

A high volatility implies the price can experience a handsome rise. It also means it can come down sharply, and that possibility of doing us harm is what leads us to conflate it with risk and instinctively avoid it.

The fact that the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the S&P 500 implied volatility, is also known as the “Fear Index” gives an idea of what a bad rap volatility has.

Conflating the two concepts leads us to another potentially dangerous disconnect: If we equate volatility with risk, then we are implying that we can measure risk. We can’t. Risk is based on the unknown. Bad things can happen from any direction, at any time, at any speed, in an infinite array of forms and configurations.

Volatility, on the other hand, is knowable. Implying that risk is knowable could lead us to underappreciate the potential damage.

Telling a story

Not only is volatility knowable, it can also tell us much about any given asset. Generally, the higher the volatility, the higher the return – but not always. When constructing a portfolio, the relative volatilities should be compared to the relative historical returns to evaluate whether the additional “risk” is worth it.

Relative historical volatilities and returns don't always match up

For instance, the 30-day volatilities of ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC) have been similar, while the returns over the same period have been notably different. (Note that historical performance does not guarantee future performance, and none of this is investment advice.)

Not only can we glean stories from recent (“realized”) volatility, we can also calculate investors’ expectations of volatility looking forward, through options prices. If this “implied” volatility is higher than realized volatility, that tells us that investors expect volatility to increase. The implied-realized differential has been positive in the past, but earlier this week it reached its widest point in over a year. That’s the market saying “buckle up.”

Crypto is different

Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark crypto asset, the oldest and the most liquid, and easily the one with the most developed derivatives market. Traditionally, the introduction of derivatives mitigates an asset’s volatility, as it adds liquidity and hedging opportunities. Not surprisingly, for this reason bitcoin’s volatility is among the lowest of the crypto assets.

BTC may be more volatile than most traditional assets, but when it comes to crypto assets, it's relatively tame Source: Coin Metrics

What is surprising is that bitcoin’s volatility often moves in the same direction as the price. That is, when the price comes down, so usually does the volatility.

A rising price usually means rising volatility Source: Coin Metrics, CoinDesk

The VIX, on the other hand, tends to move inversely to the S&P 500. The average 60-day correlation between the two for the month of August was -0.84, an almost perfect negative association. Using bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility as a proxy for a bitcoin VIX, we get an average 60-day correlation for August of 0.45. A very different scenario.

The VIX and the S&P 500 are inversely correlated; BTC volatility is often positively correlated to the BTC price Source: FactSet, Coin Metrics

Another peculiarity of crypto volatility is that crypto markets trade 24/7. Traditional markets don’t. So, measures of traditional asset volatilities are working off fewer data points than crypto assets. Theoretically, were stocks to trade on Saturdays and Sundays, we could have a wild swing up on one day followed by a wild swing down on the other, with the Friday-Monday measurement showing no volatility at all. These movements are captured in crypto asset volatility calculations.

In reality, this doesn’t seem to matter too much for the bitcoin narrative – the 30-day average volatility for BTC when you take weekend trading out of the equation is not that different from the full data set result. For August, for instance, the monthly average using daily standard deviations was 51.2%, while the monthly average using only S&P 500 trading days was 51.6%.

So, volatility is higher in the crypto asset markets. It is also more measurable, in that there are a greater number of data points from which to glean information.

Bring it

And finally, the relatively high volatility of crypto markets is a barrier for some but a magnet for others. Many professional traders have entered the crypto market because of the volatility. They bring with them liquidity which reduces spreads and further pushes market maturation forward. And as one asset’s volatility starts to settle down, another younger, more restive asset is but a couple of clicks away.

Volatility may not be for everyone, but it should be respected and harnessed, not avoided. Bitcoin has a lively derivatives market to help manage that volatility, and that of ether (the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap) is rapidly growing.

All portfolios aim to have a mix of volatilities, with the relative weightings determined by individual investor profiles and preferences. The high volatility of bitcoin should not be a reason to stay away. Just the opposite – it gives the asset group an even more compelling role in asset diversification. As investors of all types get more comfortable with the main fundamentals supporting the value case for bitcoin and other crypto assets, and as the volatilities become more manageable, we are likely to see this particular characteristic become less of a barrier and more as a quality to be embraced.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

Just when there seems to be glimmers of vaccine-related hope, markets around the world lose their enthusiasm and head down. At time of writing on Friday afternoon, the board is a sea of red, with the Nasdaq leading the dip.

So far the moves are barely a blip on the charts, but the mood seems to have shifted. To highlight the shaky ground on which the tech stocks’ recent gains stand, the Cboe Nasdaq 100 Volatility index (VXN) reached its highest differential with the S&P 500’s VIX equivalent since 2004.

Nasdaq volatility has shot up relative to S&P 500 volatility

This correction could be temporary, but it feels like election fear is muscling its way to the front of the queue of big-things-to-worry-about, understandable given the escalating mutterings about the possibility of no conclusive result. I imagine that if there’s one thing markets don’t like, it’s not knowing who the leader of the Free World is going to be.

Bitcoin, as usual, showed investors that it wins at volatility, with weekly losses several times greater than the main stock market indices. While analysts scramble to make sense of the move, bitcoin yet again has thrown its narrative up in the air – not quite a safe haven, not quite a correlated asset – and who knows where it will land.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of crypto exchange Gemini and investment firm Gemini Capital, have laid out their macroeconomic thesis on bitcoin and why they believe it could go to $500,000 (spoiler, it’s to do with the value of gold). TAKEAWAY: One criticism often labelled at tech people touting a new form of finance is that they are trying to fix a problem they don’t understand. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t check out the potential solutions, though, as long as we are aware that every solution does bring with it new problems. And sometimes a view from outside an industry can highlight big-picture issues that are hard to see from within. The whirlwind of ideas is the key to understanding both the problems and the potential, so, whether you or agree or disagree, essays like this are worth a read.

Ark Invest has produced, in collaboration with Coin Metrics, an excellent treatise on the role of Bitcoin as an economic institution. It points out why the current financial system falls short of basic economic assurances, how Bitcoin can satisfy them, and some excellent charts that make it easy to understand some of Bitcoin’s thornier issues such as governance.

The open interest in options on ether (ETH), the native token for the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest crypto asset in terms of market cap, has reached a record high on leading crypto options exchange Deribit. TAKEAWAY: This signals a growing maturity in the ether derivatives space which in turn should support greater trader interest in both the derivatives and the underlying asset. ETH is generally more volatile than bitcoin (BTC) – a more robust derivatives market might tame some of that volatility, which would also make it more attractive to longer-term investors.

Crypto lending firm BlockFi now offers yield on PAX Gold (PAXG, a gold-backed token issued by Paxos) and stablecoin tether (for non-U.S. accounts). TAKEAWAY: According to the company, the initial APY on PAXG will be 4%. This is interesting because yield on gold has been an elusive concept for centuries. There are traditional platforms that offer interest on gold deposits, but the custody angle is cumbersome. Here, BlockFi is offering yield not on gold itself but on a token issued by Paxos, backed by physical bullion. This sounds more liquid and more flexible. It also allows clients to use PAXG as collateral for loans. PAXG volume has shot up over the past couple of months after a slow start, so it will be worth keeping an eye on whether this propels it even further.

And speaking of tether (USDT), derivatives exchange Opium has introduced credit default swaps for the world’s largest stablecoin and the fifth largest cryptocurrency overall. TAKEAWAY: This pays out in the event of default by Tether, the issuer of USDT. The token has become the de facto base currency for most crypto trades, and the very idea of it breaking would send tremors through the market. Last year there was turmoil when Tether was having banking issues and it turned out that not all of the issued tokens were 1:1 backed with U.S. dollars. Since then, the market has settled into a new kind of trust, and for many, the idea of Tether folding is laughable. For others, it’s terrifying.

Huobi Futures, the crypto derivatives unit of Huobi Group, now offers trading in weekly, bi-weekly and quarterly bitcoin options. TAKEAWAY: Deribit is such a giant in the crypto options market that challenging it will be tough, but greater diversity and liquidity in options will be good for the market as a whole. A lively options market not only supports hedging strategies, it also encourages new investment by mitigating volatility, and it gives rise to new revenue opportunities for options writers.

Zero Hash, the crypto asset clearing organization spun out from former crypto exchange Seed CX, has closed a $4.75 million funding round led by tastyworks, the owner of the app-based brokerage tasytrade, with other participants including app-based broker-dealer Dough, retail-focused futures market Small Exchange, Bain Capital, TradeStation and others. TAKEAWAY: It’s not a large raise, but it is indicative of the growing interest in crypto market infrastructure. The settlement layer is arguably one of the most immature for now, and its development will be key for more mainstream platforms to enter the industry.

Institutional Investing in Crypto with Marcos Veremis and David Fauchier – Erik Torenberg, Venture Stories",2020-09-06 21:00:45+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/electrum-bitcoin-wallet-still-plagued-by-known-crypto-phishing-attack,"Two Electrum software wallet users have recently reported the loss of large sums of Bitcoin (BTC). One victim described the disappearance of 1,400 BTC, totaling $14,595,000 at press time, while another claimed 36.5 BTC, worth $380,512, as stolen. The events appear connected to a long-standing phishing scam affecting Electrum users since 2018.

“Users need to be careful when dealing with their own keys, particularly when they are holding the keys to a wallet with a large amount of cryptocurrency as it makes them attractive to hackers,” Jason Lau, the chief operating officer of crypto exchange OKCoin, told Cointelegraph in response to the 1,400-BTC hack, adding:

“In this incident, it appears that a phishing attack led to the user installing an update that gave the hacker access to the private keys and the funds. Phishing scams are very common across all types of financial applications, and they continue to evolve in levels of sophistication.”

A search through the past

Initial news of a phishing scam impacting the Electrum wallet first hit headlines on Dec. 27, 2018, with nearly $1 million reported stolen. “The hacker setup a whole bunch of malicious servers,” said a Reddit user publicizing the hack.

Essentially, the hacker led users to a malicious webpage via the servers, prompting them to input private data, which, in turn, submitted control of their assets to the nefarious party behind the scheme. The scam also involved a fake wallet update that downloaded malware onto the victims’ devices, a separate Reddit post detailed.

At the time of Cointelegraph reporting in December 2018, the wallet address associated with the scam held 243 BTC. Viewing the address today reveals that 637.44 BTC visited and exited the now-empty wallet.

In the months after the Electrum phishing effort went public, wallet difficulties have continued, including a separate denial-of-service attack that looked very similar to the mentioned 2018 phishing con, also leading victims astray with phony software updates.

Decoding the $14.6-million Bitcoin heist

In recent weeks, two additional Electrum wallet users have reported their Bitcoin holdings as stolen. One of the wallet users reportedly suffered a 1,400 BTC loss. “I had 1,400 BTC in a wallet that I had not accessed since 2017,” the victim said in an Aug. 30, 2020, post on GitHub, adding:

“I foolishly installed the old version of the electrum wallet. My coins propagated. I attempted to transfer about 1 BTC however was unable to proceed. A pop-up displayed stating I was required to update my security prior to being able to transfer funds. I installed the update which immediately triggered the transfer of my entire balance to a scammers address.”

Blockchain tracking by Cointelegraph staff showed a likely link between the 1,400 BTC thief, or thieves, and a Binance exchange account, according to a specific transaction ID. The transaction ID, however, involved more than 75 different wallet addresses, a Binance representative told Cointelegraph.

The representative also stated difficulties and gray areas associated with tracking and pegging transactions to foul play due to the nature of crypto and the many parties transacting on a daily basis. “It should not be assumed that flows into a malicious cluster are from an individual/group associated with the campaign, especially if it is a cluster used for receiving funds directly from victims,” the representative added.

Referring to Cointelegraph’s initial reporting on the stolen 1,400 BTC, the representative said: “The account that is the centerpiece for this article was reviewed and no suspicious indicators were found.” Previous Cointelegraph reporting also tracked some of the stolen BTC to Russia, although potential VPN usage voided any definitive conclusion.

“Binance address is upstream of scammer, probably just another victim,” Electrum’s Twitter account posted on Sept. 1 in response to Cointelegraph’s reporting. The tweet also posited the attack as correlated to the 2018 phishing con, adding: “No need to involve Russian Hackers.”

“The peer-to-peer discovery system adopted by Electrum is a design choice to keep the system decentralized, but in this case, it played a part in enabling the hacker to broadcast a fake ‘update your software’ message,” Lau said of the 1,400-BTC hack, adding: “Users should always double-check the authenticity of any wallet client software and take extra vigilance in verifying the source of all updates.”

Revealing another 36.5-BTC theft

Shortly after the 1,400-BTC robbery went public, another GitHubber responded to the discussion thread with a similar case they suffered two months prior, as a malicious actor reportedly looted 36.5 BTC from the wallet. Known as Cryptbtcaly on GitHub, the victim tracked the stolen funds to five separate addresses after the heist. “Some of the stolen Bitcoin went to Binance, but they ignore my appeals and do not return,” Cryptbtcaly said on GitHub.

One controversial point in the recent Electrum hacks was that victims were storing large amounts of funds on a software wallet. A guide from online educational source BitDegree noted software wallets carry the risk of malware and keylogging attacks: “They aren’t as secure as hardware wallets, but they are more convenient to use. This makes them perfect for day to day spending but not ideal for storing large sums of money for a long period of time.”

General industry best practices often steer users toward hardware wallets, such as those provided by Ledger or Trezor. Both companies recently also faced various challenges, although hardware wallets still seemingly appear as the preferred method of crypto storage, all things considered.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/could-russia-lead-eastern-europe-s-crypto-boom,"Not unlike many other jurisdictions around the world, Russia has come to recognize the potential benefits and risks flowing from cryptocurrencies by taking its first step to define and codify digital assets.

The new Russian legislation dubbed “On Digital Financial Assets” sets a clear direction for the treatment of cryptocurrencies by authorities and how both individuals and businesses can handle them in everyday practice.

Nevertheless, the new legislation may give pause to payments companies and fintech companies keen on expanding into the Russian market. While the approach of the Russian legislature toward cryptocurrencies — or digital assets, as they are defined under the new law — bears many similarities to the approach taken by United Kingdom regulators toward crypto assets, the clear prohibition of the use of digital assets as a means of payment draws a strong distinction between the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, and the Russian Duma.

What is the new bill?

First and foremost, the long-awaited new bill on digital financial assets, or DFAs, defines the term “digital assets” and their use. According to a translation by TASS, a major Russian news agency, the bill defines them as: digital rights, an aggregate of electronic data comprising money claims, negotiable securities, and rights to participate in the equity of a non-public company with shares.

The bill also provides a non-exhaustive list of permissible use cases for DFAs, clarifying that they can be bought and sold, inherited, or exchanged for other digital rights. But the possibilities are not endless; it has been made very clear that digital currency cannot be used or advertised as a means of payment for goods or services, nor does it constitute any form of Russian currency or any other foreign currency.

Even though limited, the new legislation legitimizes digital asset trading and exchange and sets out a skeleton of a regulatory framework for digital asset issuers and exchanges, both included in the bill under the umbrella term of “digital asset operators,” while traders and holders fall into a separate category of “investors.”

Regardless of the scope of permitted use for DFAs, the new law represents a giant leap toward crypto adoption in Russia, as the State Duma, in previous iterations of the bill, had contemplated a much less crypto-friendly tone and even criminalization of crypto activity.

Crypto taxation

The new legislation brings Russia in line with the position of U.K. tax authorities on crypto taxation matters, taking the view that digital assets are considered property in the eyes of the law and are thus taxable on an individual and commercial level.

A similar approach was taken by the English courts in the case of AA v. Persons Unknown, where it was held that crypto assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), are categorized as property for the purposes of the law. Additionally, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs collects capital gains taxes on personal crypto investments and income tax in the case of crypto trading in a commercial context.

For the time being, it is unclear whether the Russian legislature will follow the same model.

What is the difference between the Russian and U.K. approach?

While the two regulators agree on the approach to taxation and treatment of digital assets as property, when taking a closer look at the FCA’s definition of crypto assets, the two perspectives begin to diverge.

The FCA defines “cryptoassets” as:

“Cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights that use some type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.”

This definition is further narrowed down to a threefold classification of e-money tokens, security tokens and unregulated tokens.

The last category, unregulated tokens, encompasses all cryptocurrencies used as a medium of exchange, something that Russia has now expressly prohibited. The FCA refers to this category as unregulated, and it remains true to this terminology, as it does not lay down a regulatory framework, licensing scheme or other regime of compliance for a business or individual to engage in the exchange of cryptocurrency for goods or services. Even though the FCA previously issued warnings about notorious unregulated token OneCoin, it has since removed its warning, citing a lack of authority to regulate crypto assets as influencing the decision to remove it.

That said, the Bank of England, the U.K.’s central bank, makes it abundantly clear that crypto assets (unregulated exchange tokens) are not currency. This is also evident by the departure in the FCA’s terminology from “cryptocurrency” to the now commonly used “cryptoassets.”

This approach calls for a clear distinction between the classification of digital assets as currency and allowing their circulation as a means of exchange for goods and services. While payment is a function traditionally reserved for, and associated with, national traditional currencies, such as the Russian ruble or British pound, it should not be assumed that allowing cryptocurrency to fulfill such a function automatically equates it to a traditional currency, nor does it automatically endanger traditional currency.

This is a crucial distinction, as traditional currency has many other characteristics and performs macroeconomic functions reaching far beyond a means of exchange. Traditional currencies impact the ebb and flow of our entire economic system, with any change or addition to the system sure to cause unpredictable disruption. The FCA and other U.K. institutions carefully navigate this line. While they do not limit the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange and payment, they refrain from equating crypto to traditional currency.

Why is recognizing digital assets as currency a point of contention?

Consequently, it is worth examining why regulators are so reluctant to consider digital assets a currency. Aside from the ideological and cultural aspects against such a classification, the economics behind defining cryptocurrencies as legal currency leaves much to be desired.

The current design of most cryptocurrencies accounts for a fixed eventual total supply, which in the macroeconomic sense carries a danger of deflation in wages and in goods and services. In turn, the lack of ability to manipulate money supply in response to market demand could lead to price volatility more problematic than that of an unregulated currency itself.

The role of the central bank in adjusting monetary policy has proven especially important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with direct government financing to fund stimulus packages and government expenditure in response to the health crisis. Great examples are seen with direct monetary injections, such as in the case of the United States Federal Reserve, or through quantitative easing, such as in the case of the Bank of England.

However, the printing of money has often been criticized for its potential to result in inflation or hyperinflation. In simple terms, this means the devaluation of money in response to an increased monetary supply. However, in the case of COVID-19, it seems that in combination with relevant safeguards, it has proven to be a very valuable tool in times of crisis, even if the long-term repercussions are still unclear.

The distinction between traditional currencies and crypto also lies in the fundamental concepts they represent. In contrast to traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies do not function on the basis of a liability of the state toward the individual, but their meaning can be boiled down to a consensus between participants more akin to a barter system.

The economics of crypto as a currency are definitely far from “figured out,” which in itself justifies caution before declaring it a type of currency and equating it to traditional money. Nevertheless, economic analysis does not suggest complete elimination of the circulation of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange.

Still a long way from DeFi and laissez faire

Despite the (much more than expected) crypto-friendly tone, the new Russian crypto bill remains very cautious toward many of the original ideals behind cryptocurrency. One of the key features of cryptocurrency is the removal of a central monetary authority, replacing it with a distributed ledger to achieve the system’s own checks and balances. Since the emergence of cryptocurrency, this concept has culminated in the decentralized finance movement.

DeFi is a movement aimed at creating financial networks and providing traditional financial instruments without the involvement of a central authority. It achieves this by using a decentralized, open-source network to account for the functions traditionally ensured by a central bank. While many DeFi protocols have emerged since the popularization of cryptocurrencies, they have a universal aim of removing intermediaries from everyday banking and financial instruments while ensuring trust and security on the network.

While the new Russian bill takes a big step toward crypto adoption, it makes it clear that those engaging in digital asset investments will be subject to close control and scrutiny by the Central Bank of Russia as the central authority. Digital asset operators, as defined in the bill, will be approved and registered by the Bank of Russia and all DFA transactions within their control will be carried out on a framework of “special information systems” that are also subject to central bank approval and verification.

Both the operators and investors will only be allowed to handle crypto operations subject to declaring their possession, acquisition and transfer. The Bank of Russia will also reserve the right to qualify central DFAs as accessible only to certain qualified categories of investors.

Looking ahead

The key distinction between the Russian and U.K. approaches does not lie in whether cryptocurrencies can or will become a replacement for traditional currencies but in the fact that the U.K. recognizes their potential function as a complementary, improved feature of our monetary systems. As reported by the U.K.’s Cryptoassets Taskforce in its 2018 final report, small scale FCA testing proved that as a means of exchange, cryptocurrencies can offer improvements in speed and cost of monetary transfers, especially in the cross-border context. The Russian legislature fails to recognize such potential and entirely rejects one of cryptocurrencies’ key and original functions.

For U.K.-based crypto businesses, or crypto operators, seeking to provide services on the Russian market, this means significant expenditure on legal opinion to navigate what is shaping up to be a complex regulatory framework, as well as uncertainty on acquiring requisite approvals from the Bank of Russia.

Further, they will face the task of tailoring their services to ensure they remain within the definition of legalized crypto activity, whether this means disabling certain features or more creative technical solutions to ensure the limited use in line with the new Russian legislation. The more evolved businesses could even consider the development of liability protections from investors who use their platforms and fail to conform to the new limitations.

As far as the regulatory framework goes, the current bill merely serves as an indication of what is to come in terms of practical regulatory challenges. In its autumn session, the State Duma is due to release another piece of legislation, dubbed “On Digital Currency,” with more details regarding the regulation of DFA operators, investors and systems, and their relationship with the central bank, providing further clarity for crypto enthusiasts in Russia.

A fork of DeFi darling Uniswap, SushiSwap is the brainchild of a pseudonymous founder, Chef Nomi, who took the former project an extra yard by adding rewards for providing liquidity to the exchange through a liquidity provider token (LP), called sushi (SUSHI), that earns a portion of the AMM’s revenue.

In essence, AMM’s provide the infrastructure to match lightly traded tokens with liquidity. A variant of other decentralized exchange (DEX) experiments, Uniswap has grown to be the largest AMM with volumes nearing those of centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Pro.

The episode underscores the complexity, creativity and unpredictability of the white-hot DeFi space, where more than $8 billion worth of cryptocurrency is currently locked up in smart contracts, according to DefiPulse.

But, as sushi investors discovered Saturday, putting money into an unaudited contract controlled by an unknown founder was not a great idea after Chef Nomi unexpectedly sold his share of LP tokens Saturday.

As reported by The Block, Chef Nomi swapped his Sushi LP tokens for some 37,400 ether (ETH) worth about $13 million in what bears strong resemblance to an “exit scam.”

The sushi token immediately fell 73% in price, dropping from $4.44 to $1.20 over the subsequent 18 hours, according to CoinGecko. The token is now trading hands at $3.16 as of publishing time.

Control-C, Control-V

Long story short, adding a native token to an AMM was a good idea, or at the very least one that sparked digital bread and circuses.

Chef Nomi launched the Uniswap rival Aug. 28.

Eleven days later on Sept. 6, $1.27 billion is “locked” in Sushi contracts. That’s equivalent to 77.4% of Uniswap’s tradable assets, according to Sushiboard.

SushiSwap’s transcendence to DeFi unicorn was made possible through an innovative leaching of its rival, Uniswap. Chef Nomi bootstrapped SushiSwap by leaning on Uniswap’s popularity within DeFi circles.

In a technique called “Zombie mining,” SushiSwap gave extra LP tokens for users providing liquidity to the ether/sushi pool on Uniswap. LP rewards, moreover, were ten times higher than they would normally run up to a certain time. That created a mad rush to earn LP tokens through farming Sushi on Uniswap as shown by an exponential rise in Uniswap volume late last week.

Zombie mining has an end game. Chef Nomi planned on “migrating” the liquidity created on Uniswap through token dispersals to SushiSwap once enough volume was created. As CoinDesk reported Friday, that day moved to Sunday as the AMM continued to attract outsized demand.

'Chef Nomi sucks'

But then everything changed when Chef Nomi attacked.

The founder, who ostensibly became a multi-millionaire by merely copying and pasting Uniswap’s code, shortly became the center of a Twitter doxxing campaign. His identity has yet to be confirmed.

Meanwhile, Chef Nomi, DeFi founders and sushi investors became engaged in verbal sparring.

Chef Nomi declared his intention to stick with the Sushi protocol and that his Sushi sale was well within his rights as a founder.

Others, such as FTX CEO and sushi investor Sam Bankman-Fried, were not enthused about that decision: “First of all, Chef Nomi sucks,” he tweeted Sept. 5.

Yet, the clock kept ticking on the planned migration from Uniswap to SushiSwap. And, at this point, virtually no one trusted Chef Nomi to undertake the transfer in an honest fashion.

Through push and pull, Chef Nomi decided to give up his keys to the SushiSwap contract he and he alone held. To boot, the contract to the $1.25 billion protocol was given to none other than Bankman-Fried, who canceled the migration.

The entire exchange took place on Twitter Sunday with Chef Nomi lamenting his position. “Again I did not intend to do any harm. I’m sorry if my decision did not follow what you expected,” he tweeted.",2020-09-07 03:17:00+00:00,https://hackernoon.com/get-more-speaking-engagements-by-building-your-personal-brand-heres-how-ij1h3woo,"Get More Speaking Engagements By Building Your Personal Brand - Here's How

This article is for all my friends and acquaintances, co-workers and aspiring product managers, mentees and anyone else who has ever asked me —

“How do you get your speaking engagements?”

— with the implicit inquiry around how can they get the same.

What people don’t realize is that to get invitations to speaking engagements or to sit at panel discussions or to get requests for interviews does not happen overnight (Disclaimer — I’m not tooting my own horn here; I’m not even a tiny speck amongst the people who earn serious money out of these engagements or get invited to the most talked-about events & conferences in the country).

Just as you don’t ask a surgeon how did they manage to snag a free parking space in the most competitive garage at the hospital, so too you don’t want to sound ignorant by asking someone point blank on how did they get invited to a give a talk at an industry [insert : event, conference, meetup, workshop ..].

For getting invited to these engagements is a secondary outcome of painstakingly building a personal brand over several years. My Medium blog is a prime example of this brand.

Hence the correct question to ask is —

“How do I build a Personal Brand just as you have?”

And I’m more than happy to answer that.

When I started writing on Medium about technology and product management primarily, I didn’t really have any experience of writing “business” articles beyond the business case studies, pitch decks, presentations and user stories I used to create at my job. I was still learning about product management back then after being a product manager for a couple of years.

I started following various product leaders who had had an early start in their product careers, who were very good at their jobs and had built a following of readers/collaborators by extensively writing articles about product management and various other topics. They shared their learnings and insights over the years, especially things that they learned at their jobs, analysis on industry trends, deep dives into their favourite products, reviews about the recent books they’ve read or their journey through an MBA program. And over the years, they had inadvertently become leaders and experts in their fields. Organizers wanted them to come speak at their conferences, hosts wanted them to grace various podcasts and students wanted them to deliver talks at schools and colleges.

And I understood. It was not about how do I get to be the next interviewee on a podcast or a key note speaker at an industry event, but about how do I build my personal brand, sustainably, around things that I love to do, enjoy and share.

Write (or create content)

Thus I started writing. Also because writing was one thing that came naturally to me. There were people out there who built their personal brand through networking, talking (eg. starting a podcast, short videos), volunteering or channeling other hobbies such as photography and film (eg. YouTube videos). However, I’m an introvert, and I wanted to share my story, my findings and my work through words and sentences. I thoroughly enjoyed Product Management, and I thought why not write about it? I even wrote a controversial article about the psychological void (and the resulting frustration) between engineers, designers & product managers in 2016.

It began slowly, initially with little or no attention, with one article here, another thought there. However having consistently written over a period of four years now, I guess I’ve accumulated a mass of thought material that helps me to pitch ideas quickly, point potential stakeholders to my “portfolio” or showcase my wares on social media to get some eyeballs.

I’m speaking at the Re-Work conference this fall because one of their organizers came across my ‘Ethics of using AI in the Financial/Banking industry’ article and wanted me to get involved!

Thus began my journey towards building a personal brand. And there were a host of other things that helped me along this tumultuous journey (by the way, my personal brand is still a work in progress even now) —

Finesse your story

The first item in my agenda was to create my brand story. Just as the curiosity of an Atlantic pharmacist led him to experiment with a distinctive tasting soft drink which got baptized as Coca-Cola, so too I had to tell (and believe) my story around my multi-geographical experience across India, Dubai, Singapore and North America, how serendipity plucked me from a marketing role at a financial betting startup in Malaysia to a product role at a publishing house in Singapore, and how the failure of my fledgling P2P startup company (that connected expats and home-chefs with home-cooked meals) led me to migrate to Canada.

This brand story not only helped me control my narrative in my job interviews, but also helped me craft a compelling value proposition for myself — adaptable across work cultures, quick learner in fast paced environments, curious to learn and absorb, fearless to conquer new horizons.

My talk on Fearless Product Management was the result of me reflecting on my story, finessing it over the years and spouting it pat down whenever the need arose.

Network

Networking makes me anxious. Being an introvert is another major reason for me not wanting to be around large groups of over-eager people. However networking is a two way street — you’ll receive as much as you’re ready to give.

I had networked a bunch during my B-school days, however hadn’t really cared to form new connections after that. Until 2016 that is, when I tagged along with my friend to a major networking event —pure networking, no talks nor panel discussions— filled with confident people schmoozing with their small shrimp cocktails and martinis, overstuffed in straight cut jackets, balancing on stripy sandals, talking tech, finance, venture capital, investments and the next big startup. I was overwhelmed. I sat at a stone deck feigning nonchalance, deep down dearly wanting someone to come and talk to me. It wasn’t the best night for me as you can guess (my friend had conveniently left me to pursue his own networking agenda), and there have been other sub-par networking nights where I just didn’t want to speak to anyone, expend time and energy on small-talk.

However there have been other events where I’ve made an effort, introduced myself, listened to what the other person had to say, smiled more, made some connections (even though networking was the last thing on my mind; I’d have rather got home and curled up with some comfort food on a cold winter night) and added some relevant contacts to my digital rolodex.

Networking has helped me experiment with my brand story and narrative, test it in real life and meet some amazing new people who’d potentially invite me to collaborate on a project — I started on my sustainability project with a person I met at a networking night and received an invite to speak at an event through someone I met at a social innovation networking event.

My articles on networking here & here.

Ask

Networking is a substantial part of building your personal brand, however shamelessness is another. The number of times I’ve asked organizers if they wanted any speakers at their events (at the start of my brand building journey) is hilarious. I got a few breaks early on, which were disasters — one was a product talk about innovation at a local tech event and another was a product pitch at a local startup competition. I was nervous, maybe not prepared enough, didn’t know how to coolly talk to the audience and laugh at myself if I stuttered a word.

However that ‘asking’ became less frequent as I moved up my career ladder, gave more talks (even internal company ones) to build up my confidence and started getting invited upfront for speaking engagements without me having to ask.

Find your Niche

I had a personal (Blogger) blog on travel and lifestyle way back in 2013. It was all about the 10 things you need in your bag, my travel story to a secluded beach in southern India, the delish chicken rice meal I had in Malaysia and how I celebrated the Hungry Ghost festival in Singapore. It was fun and carefree, but after sometime, it felt too personal.

When I started writing again in 2016, I wanted to create content around what I was an expert on and what I found comfortable sharing with an audience. I chose product management and technology since I was living the job day in and day out, and much later segued into finance, AI, leadership, innovation, team building and more. I’m still trying to find my niche and evolve as I learn new things, however my holistic content around technology, product & innovation, I believe, has found a small audience or has the potential to a future large audience!

Creating content around your niche works wonders because that’s what you enjoy doing, are passionate about and get inspiration from. And that’s how you build an audience who might want to hear you speak on a stage because you’ve built a community around you on mutually relevant subjects, themes & topics.

Fill up those speaker forms

I still fill up those speaker forms on conference websites and there is absolutely nothing wrong about that!

One conference (amongst several others) that has alluded me year over year is the annual Women In Product (WIP) conference. The kind Elizabeth Ames (Founder of WIP) sends me a long sincerely apologetic email every year, informing me about how she truly appreciates me applying to speak at her conference and about how it was a damn tough choice, but how my proposal was not a fit for the programming for this year’s conference. I do God hope this is just a generic email blast to all the non-invitations (NOTE : I’m just being a prat! What that long winded rant really meant was that I love WIP and I so want to speak at your conference!).

Building your personal brand has it’s own charm — you get to showcase your abilities, your vulnerabilities, your authenticity and your story. So don’t worry about those speaking engagements, create your trademark, and let those gigs come to you.

According to onchain data, there’s now 69,836 synthetic bitcoin tokens (over $700 million) circulating on the Ethereum blockchain. Out of the six synthetic bitcoin token projects, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) commands the largest number of coins with over 63% and 44,622 WBTC.

Synthetic bitcoin (BTC) has grown massively in recent weeks and since news.Bitcoin.com’s last report on the subject, there was 38,021 BTC circulating on the Ethereum chain.

Since then, that metric has jumped more than 83% as there’s now 69,836 synthetic bitcoin tokens in the wild on September 7, 2020. Dune Analytics shows there are seven synthetic BTC projects but tBTC has zero coins minted, while the other six projects have between 45 BTC to over 40,000.

The top project minting the most synthetic BTC is the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) protocol which commands roughly 44,622 BTC to-date or 63%. The Ren Protocol’s renBTC has over 23% of the aggregate total of synthetic BTC with 16,268 renBTC in circulation today.

The token hBTC has 4,810 and sBTC has a total of 2,918 at the time of publication. The two projects with the least amount of synthetic BTC is imBTC (1,173) and pBTC (45).

WBTC has gained a lot of traction, and on Monday reports detail that the organization Alameda Research obtained 70% of the WBTC minted in August. Alameda was cofounded by the FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

A great percentage of synthetic bitcoin is circulating among holders while the rest is used on platforms such as Compound, Balancer, Aave, and Uniswap.

Synthetic bitcoin trades take place on a few centralized exchanges like FTX and Binance has revealed listing WBTC this week. On decentralized exchange (dex) platforms, Synthetic bitcoin trades are happening on 0x, Bancor, Synthetix, Balance, Curve, and Uniswap.

Despite the massive growth and popularity, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin detailed that he has concerns about synthetic bitcoin projects.

“I continue to be worried about the fact that these wrapped BTC bridges are trusted,” Buterin wrote on August 16. “I hope they can all *at least* move to a decently sized multi-sig,” the developer added.

Following Buterin’s statements, the community discussed a research paper by the Wanchain project which claimed the Ren Protocol kept all the collateralized bitcoin in one address.

“Paradoxically, we found that the Bitcoin address provided by renBTC that users transfer their real BTC to for locking has not changed since the first day it went online,” the Wanchain report wrote.

Despite the trust issues, with 69,836 synthetic bitcoin tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, the ETH network continues to solidify itself as BTC’s most dominant offchain solution.

Odunjo sources handsets and accessories from China and the United Arab Emirates. His Chinese suppliers asked to be paid in the cryptocurrency, he said, for speed and convenience.

The shift has boosted his profits, as he no longer has to buy dollars using the Nigerian naira or shell out fees to money-transfer firms. It is also one example of how, in Africa, bitcoin - the original and biggest cryptocurrency - is finding the practical use that it has largely failed to elsewhere.

“Bitcoin helped to protect my business against the currency devaluation, and enabled me to grow at the same time,” Odunjo told Reuters from his two-by-eight metre shop.

“You don’t have to pay charges, you don’t have to buy dollars,” the 30-year-old said, raising his voice above the sound of loud haggling and the honking horns of scooters.

Odunjo is one of many people at the heart of a quiet bitcoin boom in Africa, driven by payments from small businesses as well as remittances sent home from migrant workers, according to data shared exclusively with Reuters and interviews with around 20 bitcoin users and five cryptocurrency exchanges.

Monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from Africa of under $10,000 - typically made by individuals and small businesses - jumped more than 55% in a year to reach $316 million in June, the data from U.S. blockchain research firm Chainalysis shows.

The number of monthly transfers also rose by almost half, surpassing 600,700, according to Chainalysis, which says the research is the most comprehensive effort yet to map out global crypto use. Much of the activity took place in Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy, along with South Africa and Kenya.

This represents a reversal for bitcoin which, despite its birth as a payments tool over a decade ago, has mainly been used for speculation by financial traders rather than for commerce.

Why a boom in Africa? Young, tech-savvy populations that have adapted quickly to bitcoin; weaker local currencies that make it harder to get dollars, the de facto currency of global trade; and complex bureaucracy that complicates money transfers.

The bitcoin users interviewed by Reuters, based in five countries from Nigeria to Botswana, said the cryptocurrency was helping people make their businesses nimbler and more profitable, and helping those working in places like Europe and North America hang on to more of the earnings they send home.

Yet risks abound.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are unregulated in many countries and their legal status is unclear, meaning there is no safety net and little recourse if you lose funds.

For many, converting local currencies to and from bitcoin relies on informal brokers. Prices are volatile, and buying and selling is a complex process that demands technical knowledge.

In 2018, the Nigerian central bank warned cryptocurrencies were not legal tender, and investors were unprotected.

TO SHANGHAI WITH CRYPTO

A steady stream of customers comes and goes from Odunjo’s shop, one of a dozen units along a dark corridor in an indoor section of the market known as Computer Village.

Odunjo makes two or three transfers a month of around 0.5-0.7 bitcoin ($5,900-$8,300) each, to suppliers in Shanghai and Zhangzhou. East Asia, Chainalysis found, is one of the top partners for bitcoin trading with Africa.

Odunjo’s trades offer a microcosm of the wider trends at play in both Nigeria and across the continent.

In Nigeria, small cryptocurrency transfers totalled nearly $56 million in June, nearly 50% more than a year before. The number of transactions jumped over 55% to 120,000.

Gauging how cryptocurrencies are used in particular locations is tough, though. Digital coins offer a high degree of anonymity, and though the value of transactions can be tracked on the blockchain, the identity or whereabouts of a user cannot.

Chainalysis, which tracks crypto flows for financial firms and U.S. law enforcement, gathered the data by analysing web traffic and trading patterns, though locations can be obscured by virtual private networks. It separated transfers of under $10,000 from larger sums common among professional traders.

NAIRA’S LOSS, BITCOIN’S GAIN

With Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy rocked by low crude prices and COVID-19, the central bank has twice devalued the naira this year. As a result, Odunjo and other importers must pay more to buy increasingly scarce dollars.

The naira’s fall has pushed many Nigerians towards bitcoin, the interviews showed, as they seek methods of purchasing goods from overseas without having to buy dollars.

Sylvester Kalu, who runs a clothing starch maker in Uyo, eastern Nigeria, uses bitcoin to buy supplies from Istanbul and Shenzhen.

“Everything is oil. When the price of oil dropped, forex became scare,” he said. “That became a very big problem.”

The 30-year-old said his transactions totalled around 2 bitcoin ($20,000) a time, adding: “I don’t need anyone in the banks, I don’t need a person to use the back door to get dollars.”

Timi Ajiboye, who runs Lagos exchange BuyCoins, said its monthly cryptocurrency volumes jumped over three-fold to $21 million in June after the naira was devalued in March.

Exchanges across Africa spoke of a similar boom.

Yellow Card, which operates in five countries, said its monthly crypto volumes had jumped five-fold in 2020 to $25 million in August. A big driver was workers using bitcoin for remittances, it added.

Luno said the combined monthly bitcoin trading volumes of all market participants in South Africa and Nigeria had jumped by half this year to more than $536 million in August.

IT’S A RISKY BUSINESS

For some people working abroad, in other continents or other African countries, sending money home via bitcoin can be quicker and cheaper.

A Nigerian worker in London sending 100 pounds ($132) in cash to Lagos via a big traditional money-transfer firm, for example, would pay fees of around 5%. Costs are lower when sending larger amounts or using a debit card, but the exchange rates on offer are typically several percentage points less favourable than the market rate.

Bitcoin fees vary depending on the exchange or broker, but would typically total about 2%-2.5% for sending 100 pounds.

However both exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers carry risks, from hacks to scams.

And bitcoin, while handy for transfers, isn’t much use on the ground - shops and landlords rarely accept it, for instance. This means friends or family sent funds by workers must convert it back to traditional currency, often via a broker at their end, introducing additional risk.

Yet the bitcoin users interviewed said many OTC brokers, who rely on word-of-mouth reviews, functioned reliably in an increasingly competitive market and were loath to imperil the reputations they needed to stay in business.

And for a growing number of people, the potential rewards outweigh the pitfalls.

“People are very adoptive of any technology that will make their life easier,” said Frankline Kihiu, a crypto broker in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“In most African countries, there are lots of government restrictions that bitcoin takes away.”

The EMI license, which allows Ziglu to issue e-money and provide payment services, was issued on September 1. The firm initially applied for the permit in May 2019, founder and CEO Mark Hipperson told The Block.

""The [authorization] process is long, arduous, and hard,"" said Hipperson, the former co-founder and CTO of challenger Starling Bank. ""I wouldn't want it any other way"" because it shows the FCA selects companies that are going to take ""governance, compliance, risk management, and customer data really seriously.""

Hipperson went on to say that the FCA's crypto team also reviewed Ziglu's licensing application since the firm provides both fiat and crypto services. Ziglu also had to comply with the fifth anti-money laundering directive (AMLD5) rules, and that process itself took three to four months, said Hipperson.

The FCA is ""quite rightly concerned about cryptocurrency. They want to make sure that everything to do with one's KYC, AML is really strict,"" said Hipperson.

At launch, the Ziglu app is supporting British pounds (GBP) and four cryptocurrencies — bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and bitcoin cash (BCH), for P2P payments. It means users can send GBP or crypto to other Ziglu accounts as well as to customers of different U.K. banks, using Faster Payments Service. Crypto worth up to £50,000 (~$66,000) is insured. Ziglu charges a 1.25% commission on all trades.

The app was launched in June of this year and currently has users ""in the low thousands,"" Hipperson told The Block. ""I'm aiming for a hundred million customers over the next six or seven years.""

To get there, Ziglu has planned several products and services for its ""global current account"" offering. Firstly, the firm is launching a Mastercard debit card, ""in three weeks,"" which will allow users to spend both fiat and crypto, said Hipperson.

Services such as loans, overdraft, interest-earning accounts, and insurance products are also on the radar in the future, said Hipperson.

Ziglu started its services in the U.K. and is now set to expand in certain European countries later this month and then the rest of Europe by Q4 or early Q1 2021, according to Hipperson. ""And then we'll be looking to push it into the [United] States in the first half of next year.""



In June, Ziglu raised £5.25 million (~$6.94 million) in seed funding. The firm is now looking to raise more money via a crowdfunding event set to launch later this month, Hipperson told The Block.

Update: This story and its headline have been updated for clarity",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-derivatives-volumes-rise-to-record-712-billion-in-august/,"Crypto trading volumes experienced a historic surge in activity last month as crypto-based derivative products hit all-time highs in August, according to a new report by Cryptocompare.

CryptoCompare today published its monthly Exchange Review, which offers widely-quoted insights into the cryptocurrency exchange industry as well as changes to exchanges’ metrics that make up the data provider’s price indices.

Key findings from the August review show that volume on crypto derivatives exchanges rose by 58 percent compared to the previous month. In August, monthly volume hit $712 billion, which was just enough to top the previous record of $602 billion set back in May 2020.

The bulk of derivative trading happened on exchanges considered by Cryptocompare as Top-Tier.

“Huobi (up 44.7 percent), OKEx (up 69.1 percent) and Binance (up 74.0 percent) led with $208.5bn, $190.8bn and $184.6 billion traded respectively. BitMEX traded $72.5bn (up 43.6 percent) in August,” explains the London-based data analytics firm.

Crypto spot volumes also increased by 50 percent to $945 billion in August. This figure includes $529 billion in transactions that exchanged hands at top venues, which account for over 64 percent of all volume such as Binance ($124.9 billion, up 83 percent). This was followed by Huobi Global trading $65.0 billion (up 176 percent), while OKEx traded $64.7 billion (up 47 percent).

Options Volumes on CME Also Rise

Spot volumes at what CryptoCompare calls ‘Lower-Tier’ exchanges also soared to $291 billion, up 30 percent on a monthly basis, possibly driven by the hype that accompanied Bitcoin’s rally to $12,000.

In August, derivatives share of the cryptocurrency market rose to just over 40 percent while spot volumes have continued to represent the majority (60 percent) of total market turnover.

Trading of options contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which focuses on institutional investors, increased 8.4 percent in August with 2,704 contracts traded within the month.

However, this figure was three times lower than the record monthly high set in June at 8,444 contracts. The regulated exchange said futures volumes, as measured by the number of contracts, jumped 36 percent from July levels to reach 203,867 in August, with trading volume also up 55 percent to $12.0 billion.

As for previous editions, CryptoCompare’s report includes exchange trade data, news highlights, a market segmentation analysis and metrics of Bitcoin trades against both fiat and stablecoins.

“BTC trading into USDT increased 16 percent in August to 6.25mn BTC vs 5.41mn BTC in July.

Key Takeaways Vibrant communities are the essence of a crypto network as they aid organic growth and marketing.

Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash is the prime example of how crypto markets view unoriginal forks that change a few small features.

DeFi forks that do build communities still have to compete with the original protocol on the basis of features and value addition.

Share this article

DeFi forks are popping up everywhere. Unfortunately, they fail to become anything more than a “farm and dump” scheme due to a lack of genuine community. And even the few projects that do establish an early community, the future is murky.

The Lifeblood of a Crypto Token

The term “community” gets thrown around a lot in crypto. But what does it actually mean?



A community is a group of investors, users, and developers that support and supplement a particular crypto network. In an open-source ecosystem, communities are arguably the most important aspect of a project as they help create value through usage, adoption, and organic marketing.

If a protocol’s technology gives it substance, its community gives it life.

Communities are strengthened when they’re grouped under a similar identity. LINK Marines, Synthetix Spartans, and Band Jedis are a few examples of communities that have been meme-ed into existence.

yEarn Finance (YFI) is another great example of how a robust community can grow a project. YFI went from $0 to $1 billion in market cap in just a month. But this wasn’t empty growth. yEarn provided real value for the DeFi community and saw large blocks of capital enter the protocol.

Several copycats have attempted to recreate yEarn’s success to little avail. While a few have molded their own communities, they rarely rival the original protocol.

This is not a new concept. Time and time again, the crypto market has emphasized that it prices originality and innovation with a stark premium.

The oldest examples date back to the genesis cryptocurrency – Bitcoin.

How Community Consensus Kept Bitcoin’s Moat Alive

In 2017, the Bitcoin community had its first major split. One side favored a smaller block size with SegWit to reduce the size of each transaction. The rest wanted to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit from one MB to two MB.

A large part of the community backed the smaller block size, which meant that version of the blockchain would continue as the original Bitcoin. The big blockers forked away from this network, forming Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

When this happened, many investors and analysts weren’t sure what effect this would have on Bitcoin’s market valuation. Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision and GMI, previously remarked that he believed the fork would dilute Bitcoin’s value, so he sold his coins.

What these investors didn’t realize back then is that users forge the value of a network.

When the small blockers won the battle for consensus, a ton of people who supported the big block ideology ended up conceding and moving forward with smaller blocks. Only a fraction of initial supporters eventually went on to become full-time Bitcoin Cash community members.

Initially, the market was confused, and Bitcoin Cash did well. But after a while, reality settled in. From the perspective of the crypto market, there were now two Bitcoins.

Eventually, it boiled down to one with most of the community and activity, and another without these characteristics but a slightly larger block size.

The decision of which to back and which to abandon was immediately evident.

Since then, Bitcoin Cash has raised its block size to 32 MB. Yet it’s daily average block size hasn’t crossed 500 kB since November 2018.

BCH has been consistently losing value since it forked. It peaked at $3,700 per coin in 2017 versus BTC’s near $20,000. Its market cap is down 91% since the 2017 top, while BTC is down just 34% over that same period.

The Bitcoin fork episode is proof that the crypto market doesn’t value forks that improve one minor parameter and claim to be superior. At the end of it all, the original community-backed Bitcoin emerged as the real Bitcoin.

DeFi Forks: Some Succeed, Most Fail

yEarn Finance isn’t the only DeFi protocol being mimicked. Forks of Ampleforth, Compound, and others are showing up in the dozens.

SushiSwap is the newest fork that gained traction. At one point, over 70% of Uniswap liquidity tokens were locked in SushiSwap, but it is yet to facilitate a single dollar of trade. Now the project looks to have hit a dead-end after its sole developer sold the entire developer’s fund.

To think a cloned project can immediately jump in and steal an established player’s traction is berserk.

However, SushiSwap is one of the few forks that had genuinely built a healthy community.

Ampleforth forks Based and Yam have also incited healthy community support, as has yEarn clone DFI Money. But these are just four isolated examples from the 100+ duplicates that have surfaced in the last month. A vast majority of them have already crashed and burned.

Digging deeper into the changes these forks made reveals their actual agenda.

AMPL’s token distribution allocated only 25% of the supply to the general public. This has been perceived to be unfair. Yam was the first mover that forked AMPL and changed the distribution, so the community receives 100% of the tokens.

yEarn had a fair token distribution, so there wasn’t anything to change. But DFI Money still captured an ardent group of supporters by claiming to be the “YFI of the East.”

A vocal segment of the DeFi community was upset by Uniswap’s decision to raise capital from VC funds. SushiSwap’s elevator pitch is that it’s a Uniswap clone that forks away from the VCs with 90% community distribution and a 10% development fund.

The narrative behind SushiSwap helped it rally a community of people frustrated with Uniswap’s funding decision and want the protocol to be governed by its users.

Apart from DFI Money – which is a cultural play – the common angle amongst successful forks is focus on token distribution.

Hey @haydenzadams I'm not sure why you deleted the reply. But let me reply here. I said I was a #builder because @willwarren89 implied I was not. Now for builder rewards, I think protocol should reward participants (LPs), not creators. If you want rewards, do your own ICO. pic.twitter.com/EmhV6DBdEo — Chef Nomi #SushiSwap (@NomiChef) August 30, 2020

If a fork makes meaningless changes like, say, the rebasing target or liquidity pool weights, nobody bats an eye. But when these projects say “we’re giving all our tokens to you guys,” the excitement is far more tangible.

A fork like SushiSwap can muster attention, but at long last, there’s no point if it never releases its DEX to compete with Uniswap. Further, Uniswap is building v3, which introduces new features that make it more capital efficient and offer LPs better terms.

SushiSwap is a fork of Uniswap v2, so feature-wise, it cannot live up to Uniswap v3. And, as it turns out, the SushiSwap creator wanted to fork away from the VCs, so they had the sole privilege of dumping on the community.

Notwithstanding the recent controversy, Sushi is a far cry from Uniswap competitor, because when v3 releases, traders will inevitably gravitate towards the better solution.

Building a strong community early on is useful. But keeping the community around over months and years isn’t as easy.

In fact, Sunny’s channel was also reportedly affected in December of 2019 when Youtube went on a video-deleting spree, suddenly purging content from accounts associated with a number of crypto Youtubers.

There have also been a number of incidents since then when Youtube has suddenly made the decision to cut access to content made by crypto Youtubers, including in June, when Youtube shut down the account of crypto news site Crypto.com citing “a violation of YouTube’s Terms of Service.” However, the channel was restored two days later.

In March, Finance Magnates reported that Youtube banned another well-known crypto programmer’s channel, Ivan on Tech, and deleted one of his videos as a result of a breach of YouTube Policy regarding censorship. Again, access to the channel was restored relatively quickly.

Crypto Giveaway Scams Are Still a Problem on Youtube’s Platform

Why is Youtube going after all of these channels?

The trouble seems to be that there actually are quite a lot of Youtube channels and videos that are using crypto-related content to maliciously target viewers. For example, cryptocurrency ‘giveaway’ scams have populated the platform with false promises of free coins.

Indeed, viewers of these videos are encouraged to send cryptocurrency to an address with the promise that it will be sent back to them two-fold. However, the attacker simply keeps the coins and never gives them back.

Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano (ADA), condemned one such scam in a tweet in July: “It has come to my attention that a scam has been floating around using my conference keynote to promote a giveaway…this is a scam,” he wrote on Twitter. “Please report it to YouTube. We will take legal action if we can against those responsible.”

These new contracts are being introduced in order to expand the exchange’s existing altcoin (or alternative coins, besides Bitcoin) product range, BitMEX noted. It added that the products have been launched “in response to user demand.”

The BitMEX team said that Chainlink (LINK) will notably be the first (decentralized finance) DeFi-related contract offered by the Hong Kong-operated exchange. The new contracts “will be visible on the platform from 10 September 2020 at 08:00:00 UTC as Unlisted, 24 hours before the start of trading,” BitMEX confirmed.

As explained by the exchange:

“As with all quanto products, they have a fixed Bitcoin multiplier regardless of the underlying Altcoin price. This allows traders to long or short each coin without needing to hold the specific coin or USDT. Traders post margin in XBT (or Bitcoin / BTC), and earn or lose XBT as the future’s price changes. These contracts combine the quanto feature of our perpetual swap products with the expiry and settlement found in traditional futures. As with every BitMEX Altcoin future, they expire quarterly.”

Contracts are now live in (test network) Testnet mode, along with their contract specifications, the exchange noted. (Note: for details about contract listing and settlement dates for current and upcoming crypto-asset futures contracts on BitMEXT for Q4 2020, check here.)

In another update, the exchange stated that beginning on “25 September 2020 at 12:00:05 UTC BitMEX will update its index weights.”

It confirmed:

“[On September 4,] we have introduced Binance US, LBank and OKEX as new constituent exchanges to our indices, and added five new indices: .BADAT, .BEOST, .BLINKT, .BUSDT, .BXTZT. From [September 4, 2020,] the hypothetical values of the indices with the new weights will be published as the ‘NEXT’ index family (Eg .BXBT_NEXT).”

(Note: more details about this update are available here.)

BitMEX recently added support for mobile trading. It noted:

“As part of our promise to our users to keep improving our offering, we’re delighted to announce the launch of BitMEX Mobile, our official app, making trading on mobile simple, smart, and highly secure.“

In May 2020, another lawsuit was filed against BitMEX for allegedly engaging in illegal activities like money laundering and racketeering

More at eleven.

It is clear that anybody that has chosen to build on Ethereum can only fall into one of two categories: either disingenuous with no intention to add value in the real world, or naively they have not put in enough thought into how they will be able to grow their business long term by default since ETH is already not able to handle its current level of transaction volume so the scope of customers a project can attract is limited at best.

The fees have been steadily rising on Ethereum for the entire year, topping an average of $14 per transaction during September 2020 before the ‘DeFi’ fee explosion this week that saw fees spike over $100 per transaction. In comparison, Bitcoin SV has averaged about 1/50th of a cent consistently during the year and continues to be cheaper the more it scales.

Source: BitInfoCharts

Scale is not a unique term to blockchains, it is always the question that any serious business will ask themselves if they want to move beyond the reach of the current scope of operations, with resource, time, cost constraints that their current reach has and expanding this all whilst increasing margins and keeping costs down.

It doesn’t matter about the quantity of ICOs, tokens or DeFi projects there are on Ethereum. Those that have chosen Ethereum have up until this point not thought far ahead or big enough and have already locked themselves into a dead end.

Let’s compare the metrics of the two blockchains that have the highest transactional usage and how they stack up.

ETH BSV Market Cap 36 Billion (2nd) 2.9 Billion (10th) Price $402 $159 Total Supply No hard cap 21 million cap Block size limit 8,000,000 GAS

(Max 380 tx per block) Unlimited

(Unlimited tx) Tx/second maximum capability 30 10000+

It’s a nice utopian narrative that there will be many blockchains that can co-exist all doing similar functions and that irrespective of things like speed and costs, that users will continue to be ideologically driven to a name or a community.

This is a fallacy. At the end of the day the end user of your product will not care about hobbyist ideologies, they will not tolerate burning through money for inconsistent confirmation times.

Businesses, enterprises and users all need certainty in commerce. All types of users in commerce want to have lowest cost and have the guarantee that the transaction will be processed in an acceptable service level agreement according to the needs of the goods or services they are providing.

The combination of speed and cost is what ultimately accelerates velocity of usage, not one or the other. Certainly not neither.

The promises of better scaling solutions like Ethereum 2.0 that are ‘coming’ are a match made in heaven for the scam ICOs and scam DeFi projects that have caused the bottlenecks of the network in the first place. Filled with empty promises that only serve to buy more time to kick the can down the road. You could say in some ways, the Ethereum protocol and the projects that have been built on it subserve each other to keep the illusion going longer.

However for any serious businesses or developers out there that have fallen into this trap, Bitcoin SV is technically superior in every way vs Ethereum. BSV currently has real unbounded scaling, several magnitudes cheaper transactional fees and higher transactional throughput capability thousands of times more than that of Ethereum.

Bitcoin SV has broken records on several occasions this year. The biggest block so far has been a 369-megabyte block which had over 1.3 million transactions. BSV has proven that it can handle various types of transactions from micropayments which are barley fractions of a cent to handling large data storage, to anything in between.

With the Ethereum ship hitting the iceberg, the life boats remain largely vacant for now. If there is an analogy that we can tie back to the current events on the Ethereum network, it is that the positions on the lifeboats to evacuate will ultimately reach capacity and delaying your spot could come at an enormous cost.

That must mean that anyone that willingly chooses to stay on the sinking Ethereum ship must believe in the back of their minds that they are capable swimmers that can survive in the harshest conditions of the stormy Atlantic Ocean.

Bitcoin's hashrate hasn't budged despite alleged miners' selloff.

Ethereum also boasts high exchange outflows, indicated users are buying the token to move into DeFi or cold storage.

Share this article

Market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum are setting the stage for a comeback as data indicates that investors are accumulating BTC and ETH.

Clear Trend Ahead?

The balance of BTC on centralized exchanges has been in a consistent downtrend since the March selloff.

While it was expected that BTC’s move above $11,000 would entice investors to take profits, this hasn’t been the case. According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, Bitcoin’s latest crash was a result of miner selling.

Jack Tao, the CEO of Bitcoin derivatives exchange, Phemex, told Crypto Briefing:

“Amid the recent DeFi craze we’ve also witnessed one of the strongest Bitcoin sell bars in the last six months. The rapid fall from the $12,000 level could be caused by a number of reasons, including the actions of whales and miners. The price spill occurred against the backdrop of a sharp increase in trading volumes, indicating strong pressure from sellers.”

Despite this, the digital asset’s hash rate hasn’t budged one bit.

Ethereum’s relationship with exchange flows is a little more complicated. DeFi is an additional source of demand for ETH, pulling in over 6% of the crypto’s supply. However, ETH on exchanges hit a six-month low, per Glassnode.

Whether these tokens are moving into DeFi or cold wallets is irrelevant, so long as they aren’t sold.

Investors were seemingly waiting for ETH to pullback so they could load up on the smart contract leader.

Indeed, investors aren’t selling their BTC or ETH. They’re doubling down with conviction during this correction.

This doesn’t necessarily mean the crypto market has bottomed out. But it does mean sellers are running out of steam, and buyers are ready to scoop up their favorite assets at cheaper prices.

Longer-term price charts indicate the trend is still bullish. And it will remain so until there’s a weekly candle that closes below $8,800.

Given the response to the recent correction and investor sentiment, this scenario is unlikely to unfold. Tao added,

“This price correction is a normal phase for the market after such a long period of growth. I think that despite the current bearish trend, Bitcoin will definitely bounce back to [$12,000] if not more. When? Only the market will tell.”

Odunjo sources handsets and accessories from China and the United Arab Emirates. His Chinese suppliers asked to be paid in the cryptocurrency, he said, for speed and convenience.

The shift has boosted his profits, as he no longer has to buy dollars using the Nigerian naira or shell out fees to money-transfer firms. It is also one example of how, in Africa, bitcoin - the original and biggest cryptocurrency - is finding the practical use that it has largely failed to elsewhere.

“Bitcoin helped to protect my business against the currency devaluation, and enabled me to grow at the same time,” Odunjo told Reuters from his two-by-eight meter shop.

“You don’t have to pay charges, you don’t have to buy dollars,” the 30-year-old said, raising his voice above the sound of loud haggling and the honking horns of scooters.

Odunjo is one of many people at the heart of a quiet bitcoin boom in Africa, driven by payments from small businesses as well as remittances sent home from migrant workers, according to data shared exclusively with Reuters and interviews with around 20 bitcoin users and five cryptocurrency exchanges.

Monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from Africa of under $10,000 - typically made by individuals and small businesses - jumped more than 55 percent in a year to reach $316 million in June, the data from U.S. blockchain research firm Chainalysis shows.

The number of monthly transfers also rose by almost half, surpassing 600,700, according to Chainalysis, which says the research is the most comprehensive effort yet to map out global crypto use. Much of the activity took place in Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy, along with South Africa and Kenya.

This represents a reversal for bitcoin which, despite its birth as a payments tool over a decade ago, has mainly been used for speculation by financial traders rather than for commerce.

Why a boom in Africa? Young, tech-savvy populations that have adapted quickly to bitcoin; weaker local currencies that make it harder to get dollars, the de facto currency of global trade; and complex bureaucracy that complicates money transfers.

The bitcoin users interviewed by Reuters, based in five countries from Nigeria to Botswana, said the cryptocurrency was helping people make their businesses nimbler and more profitable, and helping those working in places like Europe and North America hang on to more of the earnings they send home.

Yet risks abound.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are unregulated in many countries and their legal status is unclear, meaning there is no safety net and little recourse if you lose funds.

For many, converting local currencies to and from bitcoin relies on informal brokers. Prices are volatile, and buying and selling is a complex process that demands technical knowledge.

In 2018, the Nigerian central bank warned cryptocurrencies were not legal tender, and investors were unprotected.

To Shanghai with crypto

A steady stream of customers comes and goes from Odunjo’s shop, one of a dozen units along a dark corridor in an indoor section of the market known as Computer Village.

Odunjo makes two or three transfers a month of around 0.5-0.7 bitcoin ($5,900-$8,300) each, to suppliers in Shanghai and Zhangzhou. East Asia, Chainalysis found, is one of the top partners for bitcoin trading with Africa.

Odunjo’s trades offer a microcosm of the wider trends at play in both Nigeria and across the continent.

In Nigeria, small cryptocurrency transfers totalled nearly $56 million in June, nearly 50 percent more than a year before. The number of transactions jumped over 55 percent to 120,000.

Gauging how cryptocurrencies are used in particular locations is tough, though. Digital coins offer a high degree of anonymity, and though the value of transactions can be tracked on the blockchain, the identity or whereabouts of a user cannot.

Chainalysis, which tracks crypto flows for financial firms and U.S. law enforcement, gathered the data by analysing web traffic and trading patterns, though locations can be obscured by virtual private networks. It separated transfers of under $10,000 from larger sums common among professional traders.

Naira's loss, bitcoin's gain

With Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy rocked by low crude prices and COVID-19, the central bank has twice devalued the naira this year. As a result, Odunjo and other importers must pay more to buy increasingly scarce dollars.

The naira’s fall has pushed many Nigerians towards bitcoin, the interviews showed, as they seek methods of purchasing goods from overseas without having to buy dollars.

Sylvester Kalu, who runs a clothing starch maker in Uyo, eastern Nigeria, uses bitcoin to buy supplies from Istanbul and Shenzhen.

“Everything is oil. When the price of oil dropped, forex became scare,” he said. “That became a very big problem.”

The 30-year-old said his transactions totalled around 2 bitcoin ($20,000) a time, adding: “I don’t need anyone in the banks, I don’t need a person to use the back door to get dollars.”

Timi Ajiboye, who runs Lagos exchange BuyCoins, said its monthly cryptocurrency volumes jumped over three-fold to $21 million in June after the naira was devalued in March.

Exchanges across Africa spoke of a similar boom.

Yellow Card, which operates in five countries, said its monthly crypto volumes had jumped five-fold in 2020 to $25 million in August. A big driver was workers using bitcoin for remittances, it added.

Luno said the combined monthly bitcoin trading volumes of all market participants in South Africa and Nigeria had jumped by half this year to more than $536 million in August.

Risky business

For some people working abroad, in other continents or other African countries, sending money home via bitcoin can be quicker and cheaper.

A Nigerian worker in London sending 100 pounds ($132) in cash to Lagos via a big traditional money-transfer firm, for example, would pay fees of around 5 percent. Costs are lower when sending larger amounts or using a debit card, but the exchange rates on offer are typically several percentage points less favorable than the market rate.

Bitcoin fees vary depending on the exchange or broker, but would typically total about 2-2.5 percent for sending 100 pounds.

However both exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers carry risks, from hacks to scams.

And bitcoin, while handy for transfers, isn’t much use on the ground - shops and landlords rarely accept it, for instance. This means friends or family sent funds by workers must convert it back to traditional currency, often via a broker at their end, introducing additional risk.

Yet the bitcoin users interviewed said many OTC brokers, who rely on word-of-mouth reviews, functioned reliably in an increasingly competitive market and were loath to imperil the reputations they needed to stay in business.

And for a growing number of people, the potential rewards outweigh the pitfalls.

“People are very adoptive of any technology that will make their life easier,” said Frankline Kihiu, a crypto broker in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“In most African countries, there are lots of government restrictions that bitcoin takes away.”",2020-09-08 13:01:02+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrencies-accepted-15000-restaurants-france-just-eat/,"Cryptocurrencies Now Accepted for 15,000 Restaurants in France on Just Eat

Food orders from over 15,000 restaurants in France can now be paid with bitcoin and a number of other cryptocurrencies through a major online food ordering website, Just Eat.

Just Eat Accepts Cryptocurrencies for Restaurants in France

Online food ordering platform Just Eat has begun accepting cryptocurrencies for over 15,000 restaurants in France. The Just Eat group operates in 13 countries. Its website for France has recently undergone a significant makeover following the acquisition of Just Eat Plc by Takeaway.com. The latter has been accepting bitcoin for quite some time. The Just Eat website for France details that with the site makeover:

Payment methods have been expanded and now include Apple Pay, Google Pay (via our Just Eat app) and bitcoin, in addition to other payment methods if offered by restaurants (credit card, Paypal, cash, checks or meal vouchers).

To pay with bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies, choose the “Bitcoin” option when placing your order. After clicking “order,” you will be transferred to the Bitpay website where you will choose from a long list of wallets and exchanges. You can also choose from a number of cryptocurrencies supported by Bitpay: BTC, BCH, ETH, GUSD, USDC, PAX, BUSD, and XRP.

Once you have chosen your wallet or exchange, you will be prompted to choose the cryptocurrency to pay with. In our example below, we chose the Bitcoin.com wallet and were asked to select between BTC and BCH to make the payment with. We were then presented with a QR code to complete the payment.

When payment is successful, you will be redirected back to the Just Eat website. “The order will arrive in our system and will be sent directly to the restaurant,” the site details, adding:

We do not charge any fees for bitcoin payments.

Founded in 2001, the Just Eat group has 240,000 restaurant partners, according to the company’s December 2019 presentation. Besides operating in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Spain and Switzerland, the group also has a stake in Ifood in Brazil and Mexico.

In April, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) greenlighted the acquisition of Just Eat by Takeaway.com. Just Eat is one of the main food delivery firms in the U.K. market, while Takeaway.com operates in 11 countries overseas, including the Netherlands and Germany. At the time of writing, the U.K. Just Eat website does not accept bitcoin.

We follow the money so you don’t have to.

Price Point

Bitcoin was down early Tuesday, barely holding above the important psychological threshold of $10,000.

Prices for the cryptocurrency, up 40% year to date, have held above $10,000 for more than six weeks. The digital-asset firm Diginex wrote in a newsletter post that “prices will need to regain $10,550 to settle the nerves of traders.”

On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures were lower, pulled by tech shares as traders returned from a long holiday weekend. The dollar strengthened in foreign-exchange markets and Treasury bond yields fell, indicating a reduced risk appetite, though gold was off. The British pound slipped on speculation that a “no-deal” Brexit looms.

Market Moves

In a 2020 during which the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has produced a seemingly unending series of jaw-dropping, billion-dollar twists, the past few days’ saga of the market-making protocol SushiSwap is drawing comparisons to a thrilling caper flick.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The Bankless newsletter called it “the SushiSwap rug pull.” It was “one of “the most dramatic moments in DeFi this year,” according to The Defiant newsletter. Jay Hao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, called it “one of those action-packed high-drama movies the likes of which crypto hasn’t witnessed in recent times.”

Of course, all this is from the perspective of crypto geekdom, and it’s really just the latest tech-gone-wild iteration of the reliable human themes of invention, fear, greed, mania and panic.

As reported Monday by CoinDesk’s Will Foxley, a pseudonymous developer who goes by “Chef Nomi” launched the SushiSwap protocol in late August, and it was quickly cast as a “vampire protocol” because its inherent design intended to siphon away liquidity from a competing trading platform, Uniswap.

The project quickly attracted more than $1 billion of collateral with a technique known as “zombie mining,” The market value of the associated SUSHI tokens surged roughly 500-fold in a matter of days to more than $300 million.

And then on Saturday, SUSHI investors learned that Chef Nomi had unexpectedly cashed out of tokens in exchange for 37,400 ether (ETH) worth about $13 million. SUSHI prices crashed before recovering somewhat after Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, reportedly took control of the project.

Bankman-Fried tweeted early Monday that “the great Sushi experiment” of migrating markets over from Uniswap will take place “one at a time, starting in 48 hours,” potentially setting up something of a sequel.

“If you’re in it for the wild gains, if you’re chasing clearly unsustainable percentage leaps, you have to be able to stomach the losses as well,” Hao wrote.

The episode is one of several prompting comparisons of DeFi to the 2017-18 initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, when little-known and barely-tested developers took advantage of surging prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to raise the equivalent of at least $12 billion.

According to the website DeFi Market Cap, decentralized-finance applications, mainly focused on lending and trading businesses, now have a combined market value of about $14 billion.

One key difference so far is DeFi does not appear to have penetrated the consciousness of individual investors, as happened during ICO boom. Amateur traders also have flocked recently in the stock market, embodied in the success of platforms like Robinhood.

CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported Tuesday that Google searches on the keyword “DeFi” register nowhere near the scale of “ICO” searches a couple years ago.

“DeFi is an incrementally accretive and sustainable trend while ICOs were not,” according to Su Zhu, CEO of the Singapore-based fund management firm Three Arrows Capital.

The SUSHI saga? Sustainable? Just don’t tell the Robinhood crowd about it.

Bitcoin Watch

Bitcoin’s recent drop from $12,400 to $10,000 has revived interest in short-term put options or bearish bets.

The one-month put-call skew has crossed above zero, a sign of put options drawing higher demand than call options.

In other words, investors are adding bets to position for a deeper price pullback, which could be seen if risk aversion grips traditional markets.

""Investors should be cognizant of movements in the stock market as a supplement to on-chain fundamentals in determining the expected behavior of BTC and crypto markets in general,"" according to the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

The six-month skew continues to hover below zero. It shows investors remain confident about the cryptocurrency's long-term price prospects.

SOURCE Pornhub",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-51-attacks-etc,"Despite three “51% attacks” in a month, Ethereum Classic’s price has demonstrated strong resilience. Though down a bit for the past month, its persistence may indicate that security is not a top priority for investors rushing to join a bull run in the crypto market.

However, some warn that unless it improves its blockchain and makes it safer, additional attacks on Ethereum Classic could trigger a market sell-off and lead to a collapse of its digital asset.

For a blockchain network’s security, a “51% attack” is pretty much as bad as it gets. That’s when a single entity gains control of a majority of the network’s computing power, allowing it to siphon off extra units of the currency in what’s known as a double-spend.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

So it would stand to reason that three successful 51% attacks in a month against the Ethereum Classic blockchain might dent investors’ confidence. But prices for the project’s native ETC token haven’t really taken a hit – a sign traders could be less concerned about security vulnerabilities than a quick profit in fast-moving cryptocurrency markets.

At press time, ethereum classic is trading at $5.06, down about 27% in the past 30 days at the same time bitcoin is off by 15%.

Three 51% attacks in a month

For the Ethereum Classic blockchain, 51% attacks have been a threat for a long time. Unlike Ethereum, from which it was hard forked, the Ethereum Classic network is committed to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which is also used by BItcoin. But for large networks like Bitcoin, a 51% attack is prohibitively expensive to do given the enormous amount of computational power required by PoW to successfully do it. Ethereum Classic’s hashrate is much smaller, making it far more vulnerable to 51% attacks.

By press time, the hashrate of Ethereum Classic stood at 1.668 terahash per second, while Bitcoin’s at 117.95 exashes per second, according to BitInfoCharts.

Ethereum Classic is the product of a hard fork after the Ethereum network split in different ways following an infamous hack in 2016. The PoW-based blockchain has been chasing after Ethereum, which now represents the No.2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Ethereum is planning on changing its algorithm sometime next year. In a tweet thread Sept. 2, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin argued Ethereum’s planned Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm gives it a “key fundamental” advantage over PoW.

“In PoW, on the other hand, a successful attacker can just attack over and over again, with no possible way to delete their hardware without deleting everyone else’s hardware.”

NiceHash, a hashpower broker, acknowledged its platform may have facilitated the recent 51% attacks, in a blog post on Sept. 1, but it also concluded that such attacks cannot be prevented or mitigated in a “truly decentralized proof-of-work solution.”

“The only thing one can do is make the price of an attack higher than the attacker reward,” the post added.

The Ethereum Classic network also suffered a 51% attack in early 2019, which led crypto exchange Coinbase to halt all ETC transactions, withdrawals and deposits at the time.

James Wo, founder of ETC Labs, the leading organization supporting the Ethereum Classic network, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that his team has been trying to enhance the network’s security in the past year, including expanding the network’s core development team, and partnering with companies such as Chainlink, Swarm and Bloq.

The company announced two new hires on Sept. 3 to ETC’s core development team.

“These developments and partnerships are working to quickly propel the advancement of ETC and ensure a bright future for the network,” Wo said, who added that ETC’s price has held “strong” even with the recent 51% attacks.

Indeed, the attacks have not had any significant impact on its prices, which prompted a question: why would anyone put money in a token when its security is not guaranteed?

An unattractive gift

A large percentage of ETC holders received their tokens involuntarily after the Ethereum chain split and, as a result, the price of ETC has remained stable over the past few years simply because many ETC holders have ignored taking any actions.

“Many people are just sort of sitting on it and maybe not necessarily thinking about trading [ETC] or not necessarily actively monitoring their transition,” Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “Because a lot of people who hold assets from a fork don’t really have any incentive to sell them unless the value goes up dramatically.”

Citing the fact that a large number of Ethereum Classic wallets have been inactive, Demirors said some ETC holders may not see the value of selling or even claiming their ETC.

According to data from Coinmetrics, active addresses for ETC are at all time low, 1% of the level they were just six months ago. Source: CoinMetrics

“I don’t know how motivated they are to actually try to sell or try to move their assets to a wallet or on an exchange,” she said. “A lot of people just don’t think it’s worth the effort and energy.”

Similar to DeFi

Ethereum Classic’s price resilience during these attacks tells the story that the majority of crypto investors right now are more focused on “short-term” price momentum trades than “long-term” chain security and fundamentals, according to John Todaro, director of institutional research at the cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock.

“Price momentum in the space has accelerated recently and security concerns are being pushed aside to an extent,” he told CoinDesk via email. “While Ethereum Classic has legitimate long-term concerns given the recent 51% reorg attacks, we have not seen heightened capital outflows from ETC.”

That is in line with the red hot decentralized finance (DeFi) world where capital continues to be allocated despite warnings of high risks with certain yield farming smart contracts.

“You see people putting billions of dollars of their digital assets into unaudited smart contracts, right now I’m not sure people are really so concerned about security,” Demirors said.

And as long as the market remains in bull mode, it is likely that traders will compromise their security concerns for higher returns – until that security problem becomes big enough to trigger a collapse of the entire system.

In the DeFi world, that problem could be a few smart contract bugs. In Ethereum Classic, it could be a large-scale dump of the token as a result of any additional 51% attacks, Todaro warned.

That is not entirely impossible: After the first two attacks in August, crypto exchanges contemplated or else took drastic measures which would make ETC less accessible and attractive to investors. OKEx said that it will consider delisting the asset, and Coinbase extended deposit and withdrawal confirmation times for ETC to around two weeks.

“I think the big mover will be exchanges delisting Ethereum Classic and there are no longer any venues where you can trade it easily,” Demirors said. “I think then you may see people say ‘ok, maybe I should take my Ethereum Classic and liquidate it before it becomes impossible to do so.’”

Grayscale's role

While some have attributed crypto financial giant Grayscale’s position on ETC to its relatively stable pricing, the company refused to admit its influence on ETC’s trading.

“It would be very difficult for us to comment or point to our operating a vehicle around a particular protocol as being influential to the prices,” Michael Sonneshein, managing director of Grayscale, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk, pointing out his company also has large positions in bitcoin and ether. Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.

But according to Demirors, there are only a “small” number of financial investment firms – Grayscale included – involved in this digital asset, making it natural that Grayscale is in the spotlight when it comes to Ethereum Classic.

“[Grayscale] holds a sizable percentage of the circulating supply in Ethereum Classic, which is locked up in the trust that will never be liquidated,” she said. “So I think some of those natural factors, which can drain the supply of Ethereum Classic on the market, have a dampening impact on the price.”

As of July 31, 2020, Grayscale’s Ethereum Classic trust had $86.4 million of assets under management. That was equal to about 10% of Ethereum Classic’s market cap of $861.7 million on that date. As of press time, total market cap was down to $619.8 million.",2020-09-08 20:57:37+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/chainalysis-ukraine-crypto-adoption,"Developing countries are driving retail crypto adoption, and Ukraine is leading the way, according to a new report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

Ukraine, Russia and Venezuela are the top three countries for cryptocurrency adoption, Chainalysis said in its Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, published Tuesday as a part of the firm’s upcoming report on global trends in crypto usage.

The U.S. and China are still delivering the largest transaction volumes, but putting aside the largest “whale” crypto holders, Ukrainians, Russians and Venezuelans are the most active retail users of digital currencies, according to Chainalysis’ ranking. They are followed by China, Kenya and the U.S.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Chainalysis measured crypto adoption using on-chain cryptocurrency value received by a country, on-chain value transferred, number of on-chain cryptocurrency deposits and peer-to-peer exchange trade volume. The data was weighted by the purchasing power parity per capita and number of internet users in each country.

The list of “winners” might look surprising, but only at first glance, said Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis. For example, Russia has a history of using e-payment services, Grauer explained. People are used to digital payments, so the transition to cryptocurrencies might be a bit more seamless.

Ukraine, for its part, has “a really tech-native population” she added, and both countries also have “a really industrious startup environment.” There is also more cybercrime activity in Eastern Europe than in other regions, which might add to the busy crypto market.

As CoinDesk previously reported, Ukraine is a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption, with a tech-savvy population and crypto-curious government that is currently working on future regulations for the industry in cooperation with the local blockchain community.

The patterns for crypto usage varies from country to country. Ukraine and Russia are actively using crypto to send money for business-to-business and cross-border transactions, avoiding cumbersome banking regulations. In Venezuela, people use crypto more for savings and peer-to-peer trading.

“People in Venezuela don’t necessarily want to go to cryptocurrencies because it’s interesting or a cool thing to do, but because they are looking for a stable source of value,” Grauer said. She added that there is also an active remittance market between Venezuela and Argentina.

In Russia, Venezuela and Ukraine, crypto adoption is driven more by retail investors, while in China and the U.S., the crypto whales are the biggest drivers of growth, Grauer said.

“Looking at the share of the transfers greater than $100,000, we noticed that over the past year the share of the overall activity in North America that is professional has been growing,” she said.

Ukraine’s crypto game

Out of the three nations, Ukraine may be the most surprising leader because the country largely flies under the radar of the global crypto community. Located in Eastern Europe and with a population of 42 million, the nation has both an unstable economy and tech-savvy citizens, which apparently is a good recipe for crypto use.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation said there are several reasons for the popularity of crypto among Ukrainians: a big blockchain developer community and tech-savvy population in general, cumbersome regulations for export and import transactions and the absence of the stock market in the country. All of this is encouraging people to try out digital assets, the Ministry said in a blog post.

Read more: Why Ukraine Is Ripe for Cryptocurrency Adoption

Michael Chobanyan, founder of Ukraine’s first crypto exchange, Kuna, said small businesses, which are using crypto to circumnavigate foreign currency regulations, might be turning around up to $5 million worth of crypto every week, according to a loose estimate. They mostly pay for imports coming from Turkey and are using tether (USDT) in 90% of transactions, he added.

Retail drive

There are many retail crypto investors in Ukraine, too, Chobanyan believes. Kuna sees about $800,000 worth of retail crypto trades daily, he said. And this is just a fraction of overall retail volume, given the popularity of exchanges like Binance and EXMO, as well as numerous cash over the counter dealers in the country.

Retail investors are interested in crypto as there are not many other options for savings and passive income in Ukraine. The economy is small and there is no national stock market. Banks often fail and investing in real estate is too expensive for most people, Chobanyan said.

Crypto, on the other hand, has a low barrier to entry, easier compliance requirements and is safer than just holding onto cash.

Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine, believes that individuals, not businesses, are the most active crypto users in the country.

“They are using cryptocurrencies for small investments and trading,” he explained.

This is an educated guess so far, he admits, as there is no official statistics for cryptocurrency usage in the country.

Crypto, like U.S. dollars, is a hedge against the volatility of the national currency, Ukrainian hryvnia, and against the general instability of Ukraine’s political and economic situation, said Ukrainian Bitcoin Core developer Hennadii Stepanov, going by hebasto.

“Our situation is similar to that in Iran and Venezuela,” he said, adding: “Unlike gold, bitcoin is available for everyone.”

Adoption is limited, however, said Gleb Naumenko, another Bitcoin Core dev with Ukrainian origins.

“Many of my friends know somebody who invested [in crypto]. I see huge interest, but the technology is still lagging behind. It’s hard to use it, and that scares people away,” Naumenko said.

Pandemic activation

According to Binance’s head for Russia and Ukraine, Gleb Kostarev, although Ukraine is not the biggest volume driver for Binance, it’s nonetheless one of the key markets for the exchange. The firm is constantly working on new fiat on-ramps for the Ukrainian hryvnia and is actively cooperating with the Ukrainian government on future crypto regulation, Kostarev added.

For both Ukraine and Russia, the COVID-19 pandemic became a driver for adoption, as the pandemic hit both economies hard, Kostarev said. Isolated at home, people turned to crypto as a new source of income.

“The macroeconomic situation in Ukraine remains complicated, and during the coronavirus pandemic it got even worse. The government is working on new ways to stimulate the economy, while the young population has to search for new sources of income. This is one of the key reasons for Ukraine’s interest for crypto,” Kostarev said.

Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director for the analysis platform Crystal Blockchain, said Ukraine’s registered crypto businesses have processed only $300 million in bitcoin since 2015, a fraction of the $150 billion that passed through U.S. bitcoin markets over the same period.

However, the low numbers can be partly explained by the fact that Ukraine-based and Ukraine-oriented crypto enterprises often chose other jurisdictions to register, so officially they are not in Ukraine.

“There is still a lack of legal grounding as of yet on the digital asset front, which has resulted in local crypto businesses targeting other locations (such as the U.K. or Estonia) to operate from,” Chykhradze said. He added that the efforts to put crypto businesses into the legal field by the government can change the situation in the future.

Tricky data

Quantifying crypto activity by country gets tricky, as individual bitcoin wallets aren’t marked with geographical locations. Chainalysis admits that geographic data is hard to get right if you only look at on-chain transactions, so the firm requested data directly from the global P2P trading platforms, namely LocalBitcoins and Paxful, and talked to experts on the ground, Grauer said.

To see activity in particular countries, Chainalysis mostly looked at web traffic on the crypto trading, merchant, gambling and other services using SimilarWeb, Grauer explained. If that data was not available, transaction data was analyzed using time zones, most popular fiat currency pairs, language options used and the location of the headquarters of the services.

Chainalysis also weights the numbers against each country’s purchasing power parity so that the poorer countries with more volatile currencies still can rank high if they are active in retail crypto trades (transactions worth less than $10,000). This means the highest-ranking countries are not necessarily the ones with the largest crypto volumes. Rather, they are the countries where people put a larger share of their assets into cryptocurrency.

“Countries have different populations and different GDP, so if you’re just doing index without weights it’s all skewed towards China and the U.S.” Grauer said.

A country’s position in the ranking is not defined by any single factor, Grauer said.",2020-09-08 14:04:33+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/volatility-stocks-may-be-strengthening-their-correlation-bitcoin/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways On Sept. 3, both Bitcoin and S&P 500 saw a significant drop in prices reviving the correlation between the asset prices.

The VIX index of the stock markets rose drastically which usually signals a bottom. However, data suggests that institutional interest could be pointing towards more correction in stocks.

Prior trends reveal that Bitcoin tends to follow the stock markets during periods of high volatility.

As implied volatility in the traditional markets heats up, market observers have also noticed an increasing correlation with Bitcoin. With exchanges set to open since the holiday weekend, BTC may be in for a bumpy ride.

The Implications of VIX Highs and Lows

The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) is a measure of the implied volatility in the S&P 500. The VIX is an options-based metric which rises with an increase in the open interest of options contracts.

This implies a surge in the notional value of the unsettled options contracts in the market.

Historically, VIX has had a negative correlation with the stock market price action. Hence, when the stock market price drops, the VIX index rises and vice-versa. The VIX has also acted as a potent indicator of institutional interest over the years.

However, the recent surge in VIX towards the end of August and early September this year has been different.

Data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reveals that the surge in VIX over the last month was led as much by retail investors as institutions. Reportedly, in August, retail investors paid nearly $40 billion in call options premiums.

That is equivalent to investing in options with a notional value of ~$500 billion, betting on an uptrend.

Even as the stocks made new all-time highs, VIX continued to rise, which is unusual from an institutional perspective.

Institutions are usually slow investors, in that, due to their large size, they do not have the liberty to switch positions on the fly. Benn Eifert, a seasoned derivatives trader, finds that the recent “stocks up, volatility up” behavior is led by institutions buying put and selling call options to hedge their exposures to the stock market until the beginning of September.

Bitcoin and Stock Market Correlation

According to the data analytics firm Arcane Research, “BTC tends to follow the S&P 500 when the volatility increases.” This is what happened during the Mar. 12-13 crash as well and even during the pullback in Bitcoin from $10,000 during mid-June.

Currently, a similar situation is playing out with a pullback in both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin.

BTC pulled back by 20% from its peak to lows below $10,000, while the volatility in the S&P index drove it to lows at $3,349.2 with a 6.59% correction from the peak on Sept. 3.

Bitcoin has had an on and off relation with the stock markets since the drawdown in March.

In the beginning, there was a strong correlation with traditional stocks, which slowly shifted to gold. Now, the magnitude of the drop in the price of stocks and Bitcoin looks to solidify this correlation.

However, the VIX itself might not be a reliable indicator of the market bottom due to the enormous increase in asset prices over the last few months.

The VIX index for tech stocks (NASDAQ) is higher than that of the S&P 500. NASDAQ made new ATHs with a 91.6% increase since plummeting in March. Bitcoin also surged to make new yearly highs to $12,475 with a 225% increase from the bottom of the crash.

The expectations of further corrections in equities threaten to drop Bitcoin as well.

Announcing the news on Tuesday, ETERBASE said six of its addresses, tied to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH)/ ERC-20 tokens, XRP, Tron (TRX), Tezos (XTZ), and Algorand (ALGO), have been compromised. The exchange did not reveal the amount lost during the hack, but it is more than $5 million, according to The Block Research.

The ETH/ ERC-20 tokens address lost the most funds, around $3.9 million, followed by the XTZ address, losing about $471,000.



ETERBASE said it has contacted “all centralized exchanges that might be receiving these illicit funds.” In the meantime, the exchange is in maintenance mode.



After the publication of this story, ETERBASE told The Block that it has reported the hack to law enforcement. ""We want to assure our clients that we are taking all necessary steps to ensure that the amount of their deposit does not suffer any damage as a result of a hacker attack.""",

""Bitcoin and Ethereum — those really, for me, is where the game is played,"" Brandt told Cointelegraph in a Sept. 9 interview when asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin for the days and months ahead. As the two largest market cap assets in the crypto space, BTC and ETH each hold a large following, with their actions indicative of market health and likely subsequent ripple effects, depending on their activity.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) both posted topping chart patterns prior to declining prices, Brandt described. BTC topped out near $12,500 on Aug. 17, while ETH hit its local high near $490 on Sept. 1, based on TradingView.com data. Since then, Bitcoin dropped near $9,800 before bouncing slightly, while ETH dropped down to $310, before also yielding a subsequent bounce.

""Both markets have backed into very heavy support on the weekly chart,"" Brandt explained. ""What I see are markets that are kind of in between a rock and a hard place,"" Brandt said, noting various significant support and resistance levels on the charts of both assets. ""It's not surprising the market now is just kind of drifting without direction.""

""I'm really not expecting anything for the rest of the year. I think the market is going to develop a big choppy range quite frankly. I think there's a good chance that, when we rally, the bulls are going to get excited and end up disappointed, and when we break like we have in the last couple of weeks, the bears are going to end up getting excited and end up disappointed.""

Ethereum's price will likely surf between $250 and $500, according to Brandt, which he acknowledged is a large range. Similarly, Bitcoin's price is likely caught between $8,900 and $12,500, he added.

Other opinions on the industry's top assets vary. A recent write-up from the Kraken crypto exchange forecast possible downward Bitcoin action through September, based on past years.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/09/166490-crypto-has-become-truly-global-as-p2p-bitcoin-exchanges-like-paxful-facilitate-transactions-in-developing-countries-report/,"Cryptocurrency adoption has been growing steadily across the globe, according to Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index.

As mentioned in a report from the blockchain security firm, the majority of cryptocurrency volume reflects trading and speculation that was conducted by professional or institutional investors that were transferring large amounts of funds.

Although crypto trading and speculation can be an important factor contributing to the growth of the digital asset market, Chainalysis noted that they wanted their index to reflect or emphasize “grassroots adoption by everyday users.”

The blockchain analysis firm explained that they weighted their index formula to assess or measure digital currency activity while accounting for each country’s population and economy or GDP size. The Crypto Index aims to highlight the countries where “the most residents have moved the biggest share of their financial activity to cryptocurrency.”

Some of the key findings from the report were that cryptocurrency has now become “truly global,” Chainalysis claims. The report revealed:

“Of the 154 countries … analyzed, only 12 had so little cryptocurrency activity that we gave them an index score of zero. That’s a testament both to the excitement around cryptocurrency as an investment and, especially in the developing world, as a means of value storage and medium of exchange.”

Chainalysis’ report further noted:

“Developing countries have high grassroots cryptocurrency activity. Venezuela represents an excellent example of what drives cryptocurrency adoption in developing countries and how citizens use it to mitigate economic instability.”

The report also mentioned that Venezuelan residents have been using Bitcoin (BTC) and other virtual currencies more when the nation’s fiat currency, the Bolivar, continues to lose value due to hyperinflation. According to Chainalysis, this trend indicates that Venezuelan citizens turn to cryptocurrency “to preserve savings they may otherwise lose.”

The report added that peer to peer (P2P) platforms, like Paxful which recently added support for stablecoin Tether (USDT) along with Bitcoin trading, are “essential” to cryptocurrency adoption in developing nations.

Data scientist Matt Ahlborg explains that P2P virtual currency platforms don’t custody users’ cryptocurrency or fiat traded on their platforms. This makes trading more accessible and convenient for everyone because the platforms need not connect to the traditional banking system in different jurisdictions, which means they don’t have to deal with too many regulatory requirements.

This allows for easier onboarding of customers based in developing nations like India and Pakistan, many of whom are unbanked or financially underserved.‍",2020-09-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/dbs-bitcoin-crypto-pandemic,"“A pandemic-led acceleration of adoption.”

That’s how Singapore-based DBS Bank describes the current state of digital assets in its quarterly report on cryptocurrencies published in August.

It’s interesting to hear such an observation from a respected multinational bank and its chief economist, Taimur Baig. However, there have lately been murmurings about certain large financial institutions – particularly in places like Singapore, Switzerland and Germany – fielding a new wave of demand for crypto, filtering through from smaller private banks and wealthy clients.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

On the subject of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), Baig identified two distinct phases of demand: pre-pandemic and post-pandemic.

“Pre-pandemic demand was largely speculative. People saw bitcoin had a spectacular run and wanted to be part of that game, so what’s wrong with putting in 1% of assets under management [into BTC],” Baig said in an interview. “But I think post-pandemic is beyond speculative. It’s more about, ‘This thing has fixed circulation, it will not be debased.’ People are worried about dollar outflow and wondering if they should hold crypto in addition to gold as a safe-haven currency.”

DBS isn’t the only bank to notice this trend. Switzerland-based digital asset bank Sygnum, which holds a banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, echoed this view.

“Since the outbreak of COVID-19 there has been increased interest from family offices and private individuals who see digital assets as an alternative and a way to protect against a worrying inflation risk,” said Martin Burgherr, co-head of clients at Sygnum Bank. “Now that banks are awakening from the lockdown, we have had a significant uptick in national and international banks asking us to help in a B2B setup, to enable their clients to invest in digital assets.”

Digital gold

Baig – who has previously held senior economist roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Deutsche Bank and the International Monetary Fund – likes to zoom out and take a macro view of digital currencies and the potential play of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

There has been a steady rise in gold, while fixed-income yields are heading towards zero, Baig said, and such conditions have also caused “bitcoin to come back quite convincingly.”

It’s tempting to look at bitcoin through the lens of foreign exchange (FX), as yet another currency with an exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. But this is mistaken, Baig said, since a regular sovereign currency has accepted economic means of evaluation that determine productivity and long-term growth.

“You can’t value cryptocurrencies like that,” Baig said. “While they can have this credibility with a system-based circulation, they’re still not attached to a country’s fortune. So, of course, they will not go and up and down the way the U.S. economy goes up and down. From that perspective, it’s more akin to gold than an FX in my view.”

Dollar pegging

For countries experiencing a currency crisis or episode of hyperinflation, pegging to the U.S. dollar may bring some short-term credibility, but it doesn’t work out well for a lot of currencies, Baig noted, adding:

“If you look at Venezuela or even Lebanon, which is in the middle of a massive financial crisis, could you, at some point going forward, conceive that instead of linking your currency to the U.S. dollar, you link it to a cryptocurrency?”

Provided that transactions can be viewed on the blockchain there are possibilities, said Baig. “As long as it’s tied to a limited-circulation currency, I see some similarities between that sort of anchoring versus anchoring against the US. dollar,” he said.

Digitizing the redback

The topic of CBDCs is also highly politicized, particularly between the U.S. and China.

There are two dimensions to think about when it comes to China and its CBDC efforts at “digitizing the redback,” said Baig. Firstly, a digital renminbi (e-RMB) is a way that China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), can exercise some control over the country’s sprawling fintech ecosystem.

“There’s so much going on at the Alipay, Tencent level,” Baig said. “Deposits are being made by those fintechs, they are extending credit, so it doesn’t really matter what PBoC does with respect to interest rates. It’s like a whole parallel universe.”

The other dimension concerns the potential for an e-RMB to become a way for certain countries to bypass the U.S. dollar settlement mechanism, which makes them “somehow answerable to the Southern District [Court] in New York” or the Securities and Exchange Commission,” said Baig.

“The U.S. dollar has been used repeatedly as a weapon against Iran against other countries and also against China,” he said. “I think now with U.S.-China tensions so high the case for e-RMB becomes even more compelling.”",2020-09-10 02:45:21+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/my-heart-is-crypto-dave-portnoy-says-hes-back-into-bitcoin-trading,"Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, is coming back to Bitcoin (BTC) after abruptly abandoning trading digital currencies when his Chainlink (LINK) investment went belly up. In a recent video, Portnoy said his “heart is crypto” and would make a return to the cryptocurrency market soon.

The internet personality, who became a popular day trader after the coronavirus pandemic, entered the Bitcoin market on Aug. 14 after meeting with avid billionaire Bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. After receiving a quick refresher on what crypto is and how to trade it, Portnoy reportedly bought a significant amount of Bitcoin and Chainlink (LINK).

XBT/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.com

Unbeknownst to Portnoy, his LINK purchase was near the top of a more than 1000% rally and he was far from pleased when his position registered a loss as LINK price retraced sharply. Shortly thereafter, Portnoy announced that he was leaving the cryptocurrency market. On Aug. 22, he said, “I’m out on crypto because coins don’t always go up.” Funny enough, after a strong crypto market correction, he is now hinting at a comeback.

The “crypto people” are the most “enjoyable group of people”

According to Portnoy, he feels many investors in the cryptocurrency market share the same personality as himself.

The outgoing entrepreneur and investor said his “heart is crypto” and will soon be back. He said:

“The crypto people, just about the most enjoyable group of people I've ever met. They are f*cking crazy. They are crazy on social media, they are crazy on Twitter, they have the same f*cking personality I do, they are gamblers at heart, they slant, they laugh at themselves, they just want to make money. I will be in crypto. My heart is crypto. But I just gotta figure it out.”

Since Portnoy said he is exiting the cryptocurrency market, the price of Bitcoin dropped by around 12%. Major altcoins, including Ether (ETH) and LINK, recorded even steeper falls against the U.S. dollar.

LINK, which Portnoy remains enthusiastic about, declined by 21% since Aug. 22. But altcoins have seen bigger pullbacks than Bitcoin due to their strong rallies throughout the second half of 2020. LINK rose from $4.74 on Jul. 6 to as high as $19.99 on Aug. 16, recording a 325% rally.

The timing is interesting

The timing of Portnoy’s message to the cryptocurrency community is intriguing because it comes after the Nasdaq saw the fastest 10% drop in history.

The problem with the current landscape of the U.S. stock market is that many strategists saw the pullback coming. Tech stocks, especially, started to fall after reports that SoftBank was likely the “Nasdaq whale” that drove prices up with a gargantuan $4 billion options bet on U.S. equities.

Alexis Gray, a Vanguard investment strategist, said the bull run was difficult to sustain due to the gap in market performance and global economic trends. He said:

“Equities were priced to perfection. That was always going to be difficult to sustain when you have a disconnect between how markets are performing and what global economies are doing.”

Nonetheless, Portnoy is soon heading back to Bitcoin and he had a few words for the cryptocurrency community. He stated:",,https://csnews.com/case-cryptocurrency-convenience-stores,"Convenience stores and gas stations are staples of everyday American life. Approximately 93 percent of Americans live within 10 minutes of a gas station. And 80 percent of gas stations are also convenience stores, ranging from 7-Eleven chain stores to local “mom-and pop” stations.

Many of these store locations are prime spots for ATM machines, and therefore are ideal for Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs). These machines are structured similar to traditional cash-based ATMs. They are housed in kiosks with a pin pad and screen and placed in convenient, heavily trafficked locations. The fundamental difference is users can purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly through the machine.

Fast & Secure Bitcoin Access

For a quick refresher, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are virtual currencies that are essentially computer files stored in a digital wallet. People can buy bitcoins through multiple methods, and send them to other people, and all these transactions are stored on a public record called the “blockchain.”

Bitcoin is attractive because it is decentralized (not controlled by a country’s banking system) and offers financial access to “underbanked” communities with limited access to traditional banking.

Bitcoin ATMs provide users with a fast, simple and secure way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The same firms managing traditional ATM security also handle BTMs. Since BTMs only process virtual currency, there are no worries about physical theft of the machine.

A Massive Potential Network

According to industry tracker Coin ATM Radar, there are more than 7,500 BTMs worldwide (as of April 2020), representing a year-over-year increase of 70 percent. That’s impressive growth, but it’s still early stage considering the more than 150,000 convenience store locations in the U.S. alone, along with approximately 40,000 grocery stores. The sheer number of locations and the attractive benefits of BTMs make the machines a high-value play for c-store and gas station owners.

Revenue Generation & Other Benefits

Despite the impressive growth in BTMs throughout the U.S., there’s still massive opportunity for expansion. Convenience store and/or gas station owners can set themselves apart from other area locations by installing BTMs.

Bitcoin ATMs are readily available for convenience store and gas station owners. They take up a minimal footprint inside a store and offer the owner solid monthly returns. The rental fees for Bitcoin ATMs are often tied to the monthly transaction amounts going through the machine, with many owners seeing a significant amount coming back from transactions.

The addition of a Bitcoin ATM also attracts paying customers. After the Bitcoin ATM user finishes their transaction, they still need gas in their cars, Gatorade after their workouts, or a bag of chips.

Additional benefits include:

Visibility on various ATM map sites showcasing the location of BTMs;

Users can create an account and buy cryptocurrencies in a minute or less;

Some BTMs offer alternative coins such as Ethereum and Litecoin;

Fast transaction speed through the BTM’s network; and

Users can convert bitcoin into fiat currency (dollars).

Installing a BTM is best done through a third-party provider. These companies feature customer support and have considerable experience selecting ideal BTM locations.

Gas stations and convenience stores are ubiquitous, familiar and easy to navigate. They provide customers with repeatable and necessary functions. Adding a revenue-generating BTM to these stores gives owners a way to expand their business models while introducing a broader range of people to the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies.

Brandon Mintz is CEO of Bitcoin Depot. He founded his first company – Cash to Crypto – when bitcoin was still in its infancy, allowing anyone in the U.S. to purchase cryptocurrency in minutes with no confusing instructions or excessive wait times. Over time, it became one of the first professional OTC crypto trading companies in the world. After seeing a need for crypto to have a physical presence, Mintz founded Bitcoin Depot, which currently has more than 500 ATMs worldwide.

press release

LONDON, the United Kingdom – CEX.IO, one of the largest international exchanges in the cryptocurrency market, is set to launch a digital asset-backed lending service in September. Available in 217 countries and territories – including Australia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and most nations in Asia – CEX.IO LOAN will allow various cryptocurrency market participants to borrow funds against their digital asset holdings within a few minutes and without credit checks.

As part of a flexible lending service, CEX.IO customers can decide on the duration and size of a loan they take out. Loan durations range from a week to one year, while CEX.IO customers can borrow any amount between $500 and $500,000. Larger and longer duration loans will enjoy smaller interest rates.

The service will be facilitated by a multimillion dollar liquidity pool, a significant portion of which has already been committed by CEX.IO and its partners.

To borrow funds, users first have to deposit cryptocurrency, which serves as collateral for a loan, to their accounts. Currently, CEX.IO LOAN users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings, with a 50% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Registered and verified customers receive the loans instantly. New clients will need to open an account at CEX.IO and complete a KYC procedure before sending a loan request.

Successfully issued USD or EUR loan gets credited to the borrower’s user account. The borrower can then withdraw the funds to a card or a bank account or use money to trade cryptocurrency on the platform. After the full repayment of the loan’s interest and principal, CEX.IO automatically releases the digital asset collateral back to the borrower.

Digital asset-backed loans provide use-cases for multiple participants of the cryptocurrency market. Borrowing fiat against digital assets, instead of selling these assets, becomes a practical alternative for those who need extra capital. A loan provides necessary funds without having to give up a potential upside from cryptocurrency appreciation. For traders and investors, this liquidity injection can fuel uninterrupted market activity. For startups and sole entrepreneurs, a loan can cover operational and growth expenses.

“Our clients are a vibrant and diverse group of market participants, whose needs evolve with the industry. We aspire to provide our clients with capital that helps them capture opportunities coming their way. Our loans offer that extra boost, which traders, investors, startups, and entrepreneurs in general, need, while they can still benefit from the potential appreciation of assets they own,”- Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

On Aug. 8, the day of a highly controversial presidential election, a city hall employee in the town of Pinsk named Maria Koltsyna went to a polling station with a white hairband on her wrist.

It was a small gesture of protest: Belarusians who voted against the incumbent president Alexander Lukashenko wore white. Maria’s co-workers immediately took notice of her white accessory, and soon after she was fired.

People in Belarus have been protesting the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko for a month, claiming he was not the legitimate winner. There have also been factory strikes, and some police officers publicly quit their jobs rather than violently break up peaceful rallies.

In Belarus, the state maintains an iron grip on the economy, and getting fired for political reasons means you might not find another job, at least not in your town. But Maria heard about a new nonprofit fund, BYSOL, which was helping people who were fired for their protest activities. She applied for help and got it – in bitcoin.

Maria had never touched crypto before, but the team behind the fund taught her how to install a mobile crypto wallet.

She “figured it out in 10 minutes,” she told CoinDesk. With the grant, she bought a new laptop to get a new job in IT. The rest of the money was enough to pay for several months of rent and food, so that Maria could get by until she got a new job, she said.

Maria was one of several dozen people who discovered bitcoin in Belarus thanks to BYSOL, a nonprofit fund started by a group of tech entrepreneurs and civic activists this August. BYSOL has raised over $2 million in donations over the past month.

Controllable channels

BYSOL chose bitcoin as a way to transfer funds as other ways are under the total control of the government, Russian-language publication Forklog reported. The name of the fund is an abbreviation: BY (Belarus country code) + SOLidarity.

Yaroslav Likhachevskiy is one of the founders of BYSOL and the CEO of Deepdee, a Belarussian-Dutch startup that develops AI solutions for health care. He told CoinDesk that bitcoin is the only payment method that can’t be controlled by the authorities. The regime is strictly monitoring bank transfers and can freeze funds related to protest activities.

Belarus law enforcement is paying particular attention to any money transfers by people and entities related to BYSOL, Likhachevskiy said. He shared with CoinDesk an order issued by the Belarus Ministry of Interior, which told the country’s banks to disclose information about all transactions related to Likhachevskiy and other people helping BYSOL.

Likhachevskiy said he was once a crypto skeptic, but now he believes bitcoin can really be helpful.

Can’t block it

BYSOL says it is raising most of its funds via donations through Facebook, with some money also coming via PayPal, transfers to a Revolut bank account and bitcoin and ethereum wallets. More than $2 million has been raised, which include the founders’ contributions, as well as donations from individual supporters and businesses, Likhachevskiy said.

The fund is registered in Europe for safety reasons.

“If we did it in Belarus, the funds would be confiscated,” Likhachevskiy said.

But sending money across borders isn’t easy, either.

“Right now, all people crossing the Belarus border are getting thoroughly searched to check if they are bringing cash into the country. The KGB [Belarus security services] is monitoring all the transactions from abroad,” Likhachevskiy said.

A decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin can’t be stopped on the border, so BYSOL is sending $1,500 worth of BTC to people who have been fired because of their protest activities or who chose to quit their jobs in protest.

First, people send applications to BYSOL explaining how they lost their jobs. They need to attach documents to confirm this, such as contract termination notices that are issued in Belarus when people get fired.

When a case is verified by the volunteers of BYSOL, they send instructions on how to install and use a mobile wallet that can receive BTC. BYSOL partnered with the Ukrainian startup Trustee Wallet, which allows users to connect the wallet to a bank card. Then the applicants share their bitcoin addresses, receive bitcoin and swap it for fiat right in the app, receiving money on their debit cards.

Normally, fiat gateways can be monitored by authorities, but Trustee Wallet business development director Viktor Manin told CoinDesk that when people sell their crypto in the app, they do it in a peer-to-peer fashion, so there is no centralized bank account in Belarus that can be blocked by the authorities.

Furthermore, when you have multiple people sending money between accounts, it’s harder for authorities to figure out the purpose of the transfers.

The cost of protest

Last week, law enforcement raided the office of tech entrepreneur Mikata Mikado, one of BYSOL’s co-founders. Four employees at the business, called PandaDoc, were arrested for embezzlement.

Mikado had previously published a video on Instagram offering help to police officers who rejected orders to beat and arrest innocent people and quit their jobs.

“It’s hard to move to the side of good now. But if the reason is financial difficulties, I can help you,” Mikado said in the video.

According to Likhachevskiy, Mikado put some of his own money into BYSOL. Likhachevskiy argues that the embezzlement charges are ridiculous. He pointed out the U.S.-headquartered PandaDoc has just closed another funding round and “went through all the circles of due diligence.” Mikado did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.

Road to adoption

In general, Belarus does not have a very active crypto market, said Anton Kozlovsky, head of Paxful in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.

As the political crisis unfolded, people started buying more U.S. dollars to hedge against the devaluing national currency, the Belarusian ruble, and banks even reported a deficit of dollars last week. But this has not yet prompted any significant growth in crypto volumes, said Kozlov.

Even though the country officially legalized crypto transactions in 2018, not many people use crypto and businesses don’t normally accept it as a means of payment, said Eugene Romanenko, a Belarusian blockchain expert.

However, more people, especially IT professionals who were not interested in crypto before, are starting to ask and learn about it, Romanenko said, especially when they look for ways to send money between each other or take their funds with them as they leave the country.

“More and more people are learning that cryptocurrencies can be used to solve real-life problems,” Romanenko said.

If nothing else, crypto can be converted to fiat to pay for daily necessities. According to Likhachevskiy, more than 50 people have already received help from BYSOL over the last two weeks. He added that while $1,500 might seem like not a ton of money, in Minsk, the Belarus capital, you can rent a one-bedroom for about $200 a month.

Outside of the capital, $1,500 can be a life-changing amount of money – like it was for Maria.

It’s an educational experience as well: Maria said that now that she learned how to deal with crypto, she might use it in the future. Recently, she and her friends used crypto to send money to each other, and that did not seem like a weird thing to do anymore. She added:",2020-09-09 18:21:55+00:00,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-mover%3A-bitcoin-acts-like-a-tech-stock-and-ethereum-classic-traders-shrug-off-51,"Youâre readingÂ First Mover, CoinDeskâs daily markets newsletter.

Price Point

Bitcoin was up in crypto markets early Wednesday, bouncing after a 2.4% drop that appeared synced with a sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. Traditional markets also appeared to beÂ pausing the recent retreatÂ from risky assets.Â

The move down in digital assets has provided a âhealthy reset after a fast and furious summer rally,âÂ the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Arca said Wednesday in aÂ blog post. Bitcoin prices are still up about 42% year to date.

âThis market still isnât mature enough to absorb an increase of selling pressure from the marketâs biggest investors,â Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman wrote.Â

Market Moves

Bitcoin is suffering its worst two-week stretch since March, down 15% since the end of August, and anxious investors are once again scrambling to identify the 11-year-old cryptocurrencyâs closest analog in traditional markets.Â

Is it a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold? A disruptor of banks and the financial industry? A revolutionary innovation that should trade in line with tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google or even Tesla?Â

As the Federal Reserve pumped about $3 trillion of freshly created money into the global financial system this year in an effort to calm uneasy markets, the currency-debasement investment thesis garnered the most attention. Bitcoin outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index while trading broadly in line with the high-flying stocks.Â

But asÂ tech stocks have tumbledÂ over the past week, hit by concerns overÂ frothy valuations and the revelation that the market might be buoyed by the Japanese conglomerateÂ Softbankâs options buying, bitcoin sold off too.Â

âIf you get a smash in markets then bitcoinâs not going to escape it,â Charlie Morris, chief investment officer of the digital-asset-focused investment firm ByteTree, said in a WhatsApp audio interview. âWeâve seen that time and time again, so why expect that to change?â

Longer term, bitcoin is likely to return to its outperformance, Morris predicts.Â

The high-flying tech-stock valuations âmake no sense to anyone whoâs a rational investor,â said Morris, who spent nearly two decades as a money manager for the giant British bank HSBC.Â âBitcoinâs still small and has huge upside from here.â

Crypto investors have ignored three straight 51% attacks on Ethereum Classic

For a blockchain networkâs security, a â51% attackâ is pretty much as bad as it gets. Thatâs when a single entity gains control of a majority of the networkâs computing power, allowing it to siphon off extra units of the currency in whatâs known as a double-spend.

So it would stand to reason that three successful 51% attacks in a month against the Ethereum Classic blockchain might dent investorsâ confidence.

But asÂ reported Tuesday byÂ CoinDeskâs Muyao Shen, prices for the projectâs native ETC token havenât really taken a hit â a sign traders could be less concerned about security vulnerabilities than a quick profit in fast-moving cryptocurrency markets.

ETCÂ has fallen about 27% in the past 30 days, not a terrible performance given thatÂ bitcoinÂ is off by 15%.Â

For large networks like Bitcoin, a 51% attack is prohibitively expensive to do given the enormous amount of computational power â and electricity â required to pull it off. Ethereum ClassicÂ is much smaller, making it far more vulnerable.



âMany people are just sort of sitting on it,â Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at the digital-asset money managerÂ CoinShares, told CoinDesk in a phone interview.Â

Bitcoin Watch

Bitcoinâs 60-day correlation with gold has risen to record highs above 0.5. With fortunes more tied to the yellow metal than ever, the cryptocurrency may now show greater resilience to risk aversion in stock markets.Â

The leading cryptocurrency defended the $10,000 support for the fifth straight day on Tuesday even as Wall Street suffered losses.Â

The persistent defense of key support, coupled with record miner confidence, as suggested by the hashrate andÂ signs of dip demandÂ suggests scope for recovery rally.Â

âThe recent drop represents overselling and buyers may soon step back in again,â Simon Peters, a crypto-asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, said in an email.

Square, the payments company with a penchant for Bitcoin and open-source development, has launched a membership organization to curb stifling patents.

Today, mobile payments company Square launched the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit focused on keeping patents from becoming barriers to innovation in the space.

“Crypto organizations (or even governments) have filed for hundreds of patents on cryptocurrency technology and continue to do so in large numbers,” a Square representative explained in a statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. “Locking up foundational cryptocurrency technologies in patents stifles innovation and adoption; and offensive use of patents by bad actors threatens the growth of cryptocurrency technologies.”

For instance, notorious Bitcoin fraudster Craig Wright has filed at least 1,000 patent applications.

COPA is open for anyone to join and aims to furnish members with an “open patent” strategy to better protect and foster innovation in the space (interested parties can learn more about joining here). It asks that members pledge to never use their own crypto technology patents against anyone except for defensive purposes, and that they pool all of their patents together to create a “shared patent library.”

“This collective shield of patents provides members access to each others’ patents to deter and defend against patent aggressors, thereby empowering every member, regardless of whether they individually own patents or not, with tools and leverage to defend themselves against patent aggressors,” per the statement from Square.

Square launched its Cash App service in 2013 and started offering BTC to users in 2019, an addition that has found remarkable success in the market. In Q1 of 2020, for instance, Cash App brought in $306 million of revenue from bitcoin, which surpassed its quarterly fiat-based revenue for the first time.

A few months before enabling bitcoin investing, Square launched its crypto-focused business division, Square Crypto, which has operated with a decidedly open-source mindset.

“[In] traditional companies you work as a team and focus on a project,” Square Crypto’s project manager, Steve Lee, told Bitcoin Magazine earlier this year. “In open source, that’s not common, per se. Each individual contributor is ever independent and usually anonymous. We decided that we wanted to work as a team.”

The commitment to open-source development and technologies like Bitcoin seems to be the driving force behind COPA as well. Square recognizes that the advancement of cryptocurrency will be a driving force in its growth, and that free and open collaboration is necessary to fuel that advancement.

“We strongly believe in the need for foundational crypto technology to be freely available to everyone rather than be locked in patents,” Kirupa Pushparaj, Square's head of IP and a member of the COPA founding team, told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. “COPA goes to the very core of the open-source ethos — the coming together of the community to build, create, help crypto grow and succeed, and removing barriers to innovation.”",2020-09-10 16:05:00+00:00,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-5-popular-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/,"ToP 5 Popular Cryptocurrencies Other than Bitcoin

When it comes to cryptocurrency, the first thing that comes to mind is Bitcoin. But besides bitcoins, there are about a thousand types of other digital money created with the help of different software development services. How do they work and how much do they cost?

Ethereum (ETH) – the currency of smart contracts

The currency appeared in 2015, with funds collected by Buterin, through crowdfunding – a voluntary donation of money via the Internet. By the way, donations were collected in bitcoins. The value of all Ethereum issued reaches $26 billion. At the time of this writing, one “ether” cost $352 per unit, which is much cheaper than Bitcoin.

Ripple – the fastest cryptocurrency

Most of the new cryptocurrencies come from small changes in the Bitcoin code. Like Ethereum, for example. But in the case of Ripple, the code was written from scratch, under the order of venture funds.

Ripple was created to increase the speed and save money on banking.

Ripple technology is already being used by Bank of America, HSBC. Unlike Bitcoin and Ether, Ripple cannot be “mined”. This is a centralized system where all digital money already exists and belongs to one company – Ripple Lab.

Litecoin – digital money for fast transactions

Litecoin was created in 2011, thanks to a former Google engineer, Charles Lee. Litecoin, like Ethereum, is a hard fork from Bitcoin. One of the few differences between Litecoin is the speed of transaction processing – it is faster than Bitcoin. If in Bitcoin blocks are created every 10 minutes, then in Litecoin it happens faster – every 2.5 minutes. That is why Litecoin can process more transactions than in the Bitcoin system. The amount of cryptocurrency is limited, and cannot exceed 84 million units. At the moment, you can buy one Litecoin for $49.

Dash – anonymous cryptocurrency

Bitcoin is anonymous until the owner of the wallet is found. That is, all Bitcoin transactions are already visible, but what is the point if the sender and recipient are unknown? If somehow the owner of the safest Bitcoin wallet becomes known, then it will be possible to trace all the movements of his funds on the Bitcoin account, even if he bought a cup of coffee 5 years ago.

It is impossible to track other people’s transactions in the Dash system – transaction data are not published in blocks. Operators are responsible for this – another difference from Bitcoin. Operators, just like “miners”, process information on their computers and receive funds for this.

Nem – currency with a unique code

The Nem cryptocurrency appeared at the end of 2015. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, it has its own unique code. But the most important difference is that Nem works using the POI (proof of importance) algorithm technology.

The POI algorithm used in Nem combines the concepts of these two algorithms. POI not only rewards those with a higher account balance but also takes into account how often transactions are made with other users. Each user is given a trust rating. The higher it is, the more likely you are to receive a reward.

The above is not the entire list of popular cryptocurrencies. These currencies are the most suitable for long term investments or for day trading Bitcoin. This is not financial advice – you should always do your own analysis before investing.",2020-09-10 12:48:28+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-swiss-laws-provide-solid-ground-for-blockchain-and-crypto,"Swiss parliamentarians on Thursday passed a new set of finance and corporate law amendments that recognize the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.

As per a Swiss Info report, the government has amended several laws ranging from company bankruptcy to securities trading.

The new set of laws define the legalities of exchanging digital securities and also the legal process of reclaiming digital assets from companies that go bankrupt. It further defines the legal requirements for running cryptocurrency trading exchanges such that it may mitigate the risks of money laundering using cryptos.

These amendments come after the members of the House of Representatives passed the “Blockchain Act” without any opposition in the summer of 2020

It is likely that the new form of the existing laws will come into effect early next year. With that, the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and decentralized finance are expected to gain a massive boost in Switzerland.

At present, Switzerland is home to more than 900 blockchain and cryptocurrency companies, including Facebook’s Libra, that employ approximately 4,700 people.

The European nation, mostly known for its beautiful alpine landscapes and luxury goods, has been a major player in the world of banking and finance. It has also been quick to adopt blockchain and cryptocurrency and has since supported both existing and new companies to experiment with the technology.

Alongside the government trying to push blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation, many public and private sector companies in Switzerland are also experimenting with this technology.

Private cryptocurrency banks have also sprang up in Switzerland. In 2019, Sygnum and Seba Crypto AG became the first cryptocurrency banks in the country after receiving a Swiss banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.",,https://www.coindesk.com/privacy-nym-pay-bitcoin-mixnet,"Nym now allows bitcoin transactions and has an incentive program for people running its nodes. It is also enabling plugins that will allow users to plug in wallets and applications to run their traffic through its mixnet.

What is a mixnet?

Nym is a start-up software project working to obscure metadata tracking at a network level via the mixnet it enables. The mixnet itself is hosted by a decentralized network of volunteers.

On a normal internet network, most traffic can be tracked. Browsers like Tor offer a degree of protection against network surveillance by running traffic through a number of relays to obscure a user’s location and usage. Such networks are still susceptible to metadata observation, however, meaning highly capable adversaries like the National Security Agency in the U.S. are able to see the timing of data packages being sent across a network to get an idea of what’s going on, even if they can’t see the actual contents of the packages.

It’s like when the NSA was tracking alleged terrorists’ phone calls in the U.S. While they weren’t eavesdropping on the calls themselves, they were looking at those involved in the calls as well as the duration of the calls and other details.

A mix network or “mixnet,” on the other hand, (taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes”) obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network.

“In a mixnet all the data packets get shuffled around, and then it’s emitted in a different order than [how] they came in, with a small delay,” said Dave Hrycyszyn, CTO of Nym. “Basically a mixnet acts like a game of Yahtzee, where the dice are data packs, they get shaken around on the mixnet and come out in an entirely different manner than they went in.”

Doing that multiple times, said Hrycyszyn, makes it impossible for an attacker monitoring all the network traffic on the internet to see who’s communicating with whom.

Incentives paid in bitcoin

Nym has largely been focusing on its testnet, with node operators hosting them as a labor of love. Now, Nym will compensate operators using bitcoin. One way it offers rewards is through L-BTC on the Liquid sidechain using the Blockstream Green wallet. Liquid offers on-chain privacy using confidential transactions, which obscure the amounts being paid. For those who don’t have or want a Blockstream Green wallet, Nym will reward operators with BTC because Nym doesn’t want to force anyone to adopt a particular wallet. It will also be launching an incentivized bounty program to test the network’s strength.

Nym is also launching its own reputation system, NYMPH, which lets it and node operators keep track of which mixnodes are online and mixing data packs, even across multiple chains.

The company is also adding greater functionality for running transactions and web traffic over its mixnet.

“Nym is plug-and-play replacement for Tor for any wallet that supports SOCKS5, or any application that supports SOCKS5,” said Nym CEO Harry Halpin.

For example, the Nym team has streamed video through Firefox on the network, though Halpin says that is still experimental at this point.

SOCKS is a protocol that exchanges network packets between device and server via a proxy.

“What Nym does is, just like Tor, start a SOCKS5 client up on your local machine. You send all your traffic from the app there. It transforms it into Sphinx packets (the same format Lightning uses, but invented for mixnets) and sends the traffic through the Nym mixnet,” he said.

‘A step forward’ for privacy

Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, said in a statement that Nym’s mixnet technology looks promising as a modern upgrade to Tor and is a step forward in terms of privacy.

“Network privacy is a crucial component to ensuring the financial privacy of Bitcoin users, so we were very happy to collaborate with Nym on its integration with Liquid,” he said.

“Nym’s SOCKS5 architecture made adding Blockstream Green wallet support easy, and we’ll keep an eye on the project with a view to adding standalone support in the future.”

These are important steps for mixnets, which aren’t in regular use right now and are traditionally fairly slow and clunky. The slowness is in part due to disrupting the timing of data packet delivery to foil network-level observers.

Nym recognizes that while this is important progress, it’s not a privacy panacea. At least, not yet.",2020-09-10 20:26:18+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-african-crypto-exchange-luno-expanding-globally-acquisition-digital-currency-group/,"South African Crypto Exchange Luno Expanding Globally After Acquisition by Digital Currency Group

Digital Currency Group has acquired South African cryptocurrency exchange Luno, which has more than five million customers in over 40 countries. The acquisition will help Luno expand globally, including across its existing markets in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

DCG Committed to Helping Luno Expand Globally

New York-based Digital Currency Group (DCG), an investment firm that has backed more than 160 blockchain companies in 35 countries, announced Wednesday the acquisition of South African cryptocurrency exchange Luno. DCG is also the parent company of Grayscale Investments, Genesis prime brokerage, and the recently launched mining subsidiary Foundry. The company invested in Luno’s seed round in 2014.

Founded in South Africa in 2013, Luno is now headquartered in London with regional hubs in Singapore and Cape Town. The company also maintains local offices in Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, the U.K., Zambia, and Australia.

While the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, Wednesday’s announcement confirms:

DCG will be making a significant financial commitment to help Luno expand globally, both in geographies where Luno currently operates and beyond.

Luno will operate as an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary of DCG. Having grown significantly in recent years, the exchange currently has more than five million customers spanning over 40 countries and about 400 employees. The exchange currently operates across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Luno is South Africa’s largest crypto trading platform and the first fully approved crypto exchange in Malaysia.

Marcus Swanepoel, Luno’s CEO, explained what the acquisition means for his exchange. “In short, it will enable us to reach our target of upgrading 1 billion people to a better financial system by 2030, a target we set for ourselves a few years ago, faster and better than if we did it completely on our own,” he said.

Former CIA counterintelligence and staff investigator Kevin Shipp, who has close to 150,000 followers on Twitter, has now dragged a recent Microsoft cryptocurrency patent into the quagmire.

On Sept. 10, Shipp linked Microsoft’s recent cryptocurrency patent, which would enable users to mine crypto using their body activity data, to a short-lived Microsoft ad that had featured the Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic.

The ad, which promoted a new mixed reality headset from Microsoft called HoloLens 2, was notably pulled after far-right internet users targeted the video in protest against Abramovic’s alleged Satanism.

Shipp’s Twitter feed provides ample evidence of his taste for conspiracy — Abramovic and Gates are just two of many public figures tarred with the brush of “shadow government” connections, purported paeodophilia advocacy, “Antifa” insurgency and “black supremacy.”

In recent months, conspiratorial far-right politics is no longer easy to dismiss as a fringe phenomenon; witness the rise of Qanon, a web of proliferating theories that casts Donald Trump as a valiant warrior against a Satanist, deep state cabal sunk in paedophilia and child sacrifice.

Nor is Shipp the first to fixate on the seemingly obscure case of “Microsoft patent WO2020060606.” Earlier this year, the renowned Oscar-winning film director Nikita Mikhalov told Russian state-owned media outlet RT that the cryptocurrency patent was testament to Bill Gates’ nefarious plans to use vaccination as a ruse to implant humanity with microchips.

Zeroing in on the patent’s name, Mikailov remarked:

“The 060606 part is somewhat alarming. You probably understand this, right? Is this a coincidence or an intentional selection of such a symbol, which in the Apocalypse of John is called the ‘number of the beast’ – the 666.”

yEarn Finance's token shot up 15% in response to the announcement, gaining over $4,000 within minutes

Share this article

Coinbase will list yEarn Finance‘s governance token YFI on Coinbase Pro with trading scheduled to begin Sept. 15. YFI prices rose by over $4,000, or 15%, following the announcement.

yEarn Finance Takes DeFi by Storm

From its beginnings as iEarn Finance in February of 2020 this year, yEarn Finance has taken the world of DeFi by storm. The project was the first to attempt to aggregate yields. Instead of flipping between various DeFi protocols, yEarn Finance automatically allocates user funds to platforms with the highest return. Moreover, yEarn Finance substantially reduces Ethereum transaction and gas fees by pooling fees from hundreds of users. These features have allowed yEarn Finance to take hold among beginners and veterans alike.

The YFI governance token first debuted at $31.65 after its launch in July of this year. Since then, yEarn Finance has seen a meteoric rise, now trading at over $30,000.

In response to today’s listing news, the token rose another 15% from $29,277 to $33,721—and this is for a cryptocurrency which the founder Andre Cronje has said is “completely valueless.”

Coinbase Affirms YFI’s Legitimacy

The sudden pop in prices isn’t unexpected. Coinbase has credibility in choosing reputable projects to list on the exchange, so the announcement is an accolade of legitimacy for yEarn Finance. Not only that, but the listing on Coinbase Pro will also make the token available to millions of potential U.S. retail buyers, stimulating more demand for YFI. This effect is so profound that it even has a name among cryptocurrency enthusiasts—the “Coinbase Effect.”

What does come as a surprise is that YFI was listed at all. In July, Coinbase announced that it was exploring a range of DeFi assets for listing consideration. Most of these assets were relatively well-established DeFi tokens like Curve, Band, Balancer, Blockstack, and Kava. The exchange also mentioned a few obscure tokens like Helium and The Graph, but nowhere did Coinbase say it was considering yEarn Finance.

As such, the surprise listing shocked YFI prices into action. YFI prices already have gone 1,000x in two short months, and there’s still no ceiling in sight.

Disclosure: Andre Cronje, the creator of yEarn Finance, is an equity-holder in Crypto Briefing.

Slovakian firm ETERBASE, which describes itself as “Europe’s premier digital asset exchange,” revealed yesterday that around $5.4m was stolen.

“Law enforcement authorities have been informed and we will assist as much as we can in the ongoing investigations,” it added. “We want to inform our users that we have enough capital to meet all our obligations.”

The firm moved quickly to contact the exchanges that it believes were used to receive the stolen funds. It claimed on Twitter that a large part of the digital currency ended up at Binance, Huobi and HitBTC.

Six hot wallets were affected, managing digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ether, ALGO, Ripple, Tezos and TRON.

Digital thefts at cryptocurrency exchanges are the 21st century equivalent of a bank heist, although with far fewer chances of the culprits ever getting caught.

They occur with worrying regularity: in February this year Italian exchange Altsbit said it had lost almost all the funds entrusted to it in a cyber-attack.

Some of the biggest of recent years have included a $32m attack on Japanese player Bitpoint last year; a $52m heist at South Korea’s UpBit a few months later; a $60m raid on Japanese exchange Zaif in September 2018 and a $31m attack on Seoul-based Bithumb a few months previously.

Many of these raids may have been coordinated by North Korean hackers, who have been singled out for attention by both the UN and security researchers at FireEye.

In fact, last year the UN claimed that Pyongyang had amassed a fortune of $2bn after its increasingly sophisticated hacking units attacked banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.",2020-09-10 10:35:00,https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/10/1008282/north-korea-hackers-money-laundering-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/,"But the North Korean playbook has evolved in the last few years. One tactic, known as a “peel chain,” moves money in rapid and automated transactions from one Bitcoin wallet to new addresses through hundreds or thousands of transactions in a way that both hides the source of the money and lessens the risk of setting off red flags. Another approach, called “chain hopping,” moves the money through different cryptocurrencies and blockchains to get it away from Bitcoin—where every transaction is posted to a public ledger—and into other, more private currencies. The idea is to make the trail go cold or, better yet, raise false alarms for investigators.

The Lazarus laundering operation, says Janczewski, involves creating and maintaining hundreds of false accounts and identities, a consistent level of sophistication and effort that underlines just how important the operation is for Pyongyang. It’s extremely difficult to name a precise amount, but experts have estimated that North Korea relies on criminal activity for up to 15% of its income, with a significant portion of that driven by cyberattacks.

A quiet arms race

Stealing cryptocurrency is far from the perfect crime, however. Police and regulators were once almost clueless, but they now have years of cryptocurrency investigation experience under their belts. In addition, they are gaining increasing levels of cooperation from exchanges, which face government pressure and want greater legitimacy. Investigators have moved from being perpetually on the back foot to being more proactive, with the result that many exchanges have responded with new rules and controls that simply did not exist before. Blockchain surveillance tools are powerful and increasingly widespread, proving that cryptocurrency is not as anonymous as popular myth might have it. It turns out the state still has plenty of power even in this cypherpunk world.

No matter how many peels and hops a hacker might throw the stolen cryptocurrency through, the effort usually comes up against an undeniable fact: if you’re trying to exchange a huge amount of cryptocurrency for US dollars, you’ll almost inevitably have to bring it all back to Bitcoin. No other cryptocurrency is so widely accepted or so easily converted to cash. Though new coins and privacy technologies have been emerging for years, Bitcoin and its public ledger remain “the backbone of the cryptocurrency economy,” says Janczewski.

That means the ultimate destination of the coin is often an over-the-counter trader—a bespoke operation in a country like China that can turn coin into cash, sometimes with no strings attached. These traders often ignore legal requirements, like the know-your-customer laws that make many bigger cryptocurrency exchanges risky places to launder stolen billions.

“What we used to see was just Bitcoin transactions between a theft and the movement toward over-the-counter traders that enable Lazarus to get out of Bitcoin. That’s relatively straightforward,” says Jonathan Levin, the founder of the cryptocurrency investigation firm Chainalysis. “Now there are a lot more currencies involved. They are able to move through obscure currencies, but eventually they end in the same spot, which is moving it back to Bitcoin and through the over-the-counter market.”

Over-the-counter operations are the preferred way for Lazarus to move millions in Bitcoin into cash.

And the business is enormous: the top 100 over-the-counter traders engaging in money laundering receive hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin every month, accounting for around 1% of all Bitcoin activity.

Bitcoin-fueled illegal activity does not account for most use of blockchains, but it does remain significant and continues to grow, according to Chainalysis. Ransomware, for example, is a billion-dollar business made possible by cryptocurrency, while anonymous darknet markets moved over $600 million in Bitcoin in 2019.

“There is a sophistication higher than we’ve seen in the past,” Levin says. “Some of that has been successful, but with the US increasingly taking action and exchanges responding to requests to freeze funds and seize assets, these techniques may not be that effective moving forward.”",2020-09-10 00:00:00

Bitcoin and Ethereum need no introduction. Bitcoin, founded in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first successful cryptocurrency when it launched. While not the first attempt at a decentralised currency, Bitcoin was the only one, at the time, to gain significant traction and adoption.

Through its success, it inspired the development of many other crypto projects, including Ethereum. Initially proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the project went live in 2015. Ethereum took one of the key innovations behind Bitcoin, the blockchain, and repurposed it to support a broader range of functions.

So, is Ethereum better than Bitcoin? That’s a tricky question. Realistically, they should not be in direct competition, even though they do share a few similarities. Both are decentralised with no central issuer or authority, have a native token powering the network and utilise the distributed ledger technology known as the blockchain.

Despite these similarities, however, there’s a long list of differences between the two projects. And passionate communities on both sides inevitably pit Ethereum against Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency fit for purpose

Before comparing the technical details of Ethereum vs Bitcoin, let’s discuss the purpose of each project.

The original vision for Bitcoin was the creation of a digital currency, independent from governments and banks around the world. Introduced right after the global financial crisis, Bitcoin was promising a censorship-resistant, decentralised financial system at the time when the trust in the traditional financial system was at an all-time low.

While Bitcoin aims to create a new financial system, Ethereum expands on that vision. The Ethereum network, through its Virtual Machine and smart contract functionality, allows for the development of real-world applications on top of it. You can think of it as the decentralised app store.

Сonsensus matters

At the moment, both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are using proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms. PoW networks are very secure but tend to be relatively slow and resource-intensive.

The Ethereum network, however, is in the process of migrating to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. The transition is meant to address the scalability issues that have plagued Ethereum for many years. In PoS, miners are replaced with validators, who stake their coins to secure the network. The Ethereum community chose to go with the Casper PoS protocol, which has a punishment mechanism to prevent malicious behaviour.

Cryptocurrency supply

Arguably, supply is the key difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Bitcoin has a limited supply, with only 21 million coins set to be mined. This adds a scarcity element to the bitcoin economics. Furthermore, the new supply of BTC is reduced roughly every four years, through a process called halving.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap on the amount of ETH that can be created. As it attempts to be a decentralised app store, supporting an entire ecosystem of applications, capping the supply would be counterintuitive.

Transaction fees

The concept of transaction fees is another differentiating feature in the Ethereum versus Bitcoin comparison.

On the Bitcoin network, transaction fees are paid for each and every transaction. These fees go to the miners who then validate transactions and place them into a block.

Ethereum network uses the concept of gas, priced in ETH, instead of transaction fees. Every interaction with the Ethereum blockchain requires a certain amount of computational effort. Gas is used to pay for that computation. Simple send orders, for example, require little effort. Complex interactions with smart contracts, on the other hand, are very gas-intensive. So the cost of an Ethereum transaction depends on its complexity and the gas price, which is set by the miners.

Block size

Block size is important in comparing Bitcoin vs Ethereum. It plays a key role in determining the transaction costs, confirmation times and scalability of a blockchain.

Open a trading account in less than 3 min Create account

Blocks on the Bitcoin network are currently 1 MB. Disagreements over the block size eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash as the fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size to 8 MB, while Bitcoin maintained its block size at 1 MB and implemented the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork to increase the number of transactions that can fit into a block.

On the Ethereum network, the block size is measured in gas and each block is limited to 12.5 million gas. The gas limit was increased as recently as June 2020, from 10 million, to alleviate the stress on the network, increase processing capacity and reduce fees.

Latest performance highlights and news

So far, 2020 has been a good year for cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH. BTC reached $12,000 on August 18, up from close to $7,500 at the end of 2019. ETH has had an even more impressive run, rallying from $140 to a high of $475 on September 2.

Over the past week, cryptocurrencies have experienced a short but relatively steep sell-off, with ETH dropping back to $330 in a matter of a few days and BTC testing the $10,000 level. The sell-off coincided with a broad decline in asset prices, from stocks to gold, partially attributed to a rally in the US dollar.

So, what are some of the recent news and developments related to Ethereum and Bitcoin? For quite some time, the main focus of the Ethereum community has been on the PoS migration. It should be able to address the scalability concerns and high transaction fees of the network. The most recent estimates put the launch of the Beacon Chain at the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021.

More recently, the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) applications have pushed transactions and fees on Ethereum to all-time highs. Not only that, but the total amount of gas used on Ethereum is more than double the peak of 2018 level, while the price of gas is almost five times higher.

Another exciting development has been the introduction of tokenised Bitcoin on the Ethereum network. Remember, the two projects operate on different blockchains that are not compatible. To date, almost $500m (£388m, €425m) worth of BTC has been tokenised on Ethereum. This represents just 0.3 per cent of the total BTC market cap, with the space poised to grow.

Ethereum vs Bitcoin: investment thoughts

As always, predicting asset prices is a thankless task. Instead, we can look at the fundamentals of both networks to assess their future potential. BTC, for instance, is underpinned by strong institutional interest and limited supply acts as an inflation hedge, ever more valuable in the world of easy monetary policies. ETH, on the other hand, supports a growing ecosystem of decentralised applications and the transition to PoS will further cement its position as the only meaningful smart contracts platform. On fundamentals, both cryptocurrencies are well-positioned for future growth.

Fundamentals aside, there are plenty of optimistic price predictions for both ETH and BTC. According to a stock-to-flow price model, BTC is closely following the trend of the previous two halvings. The model suggests that BTC could reach $288,000 during this four-year halving cycle. Similarly, data analysis firm Ecoinometrics recently issued a price target of $41,000 by the end of 2020 for BTC.

So, which coin should you invest in right now, Ethereum or Bitcoin? Overall, both cryptocurrencies could be attractive investment opportunities and have a place in an investment portfolio. But as always, investors should exercise caution and do their research before investing in any crypto project.

ETH vs BTC: how to trade both ETH and BTC with Capital.com

There are several ways to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum, as well as other cryptocurrencies. Capital.com allows investors and traders to do so through contracts for difference (CFDs).



A CFD is a derivative product where a broker agrees to pay a trader the difference in the value of an underlying security between two dates; the opening and closing dates of the contract. You can either hold a long position, speculating that the price will rise, or a short position, speculating that the price will fall.



Besides, when trading ETH and BTC via CFDs, you have greater flexibility as you are not tied to the asset: you have merely bought or sold a derivative contract without having to hold the coins themselves.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin total mining hashrate rose to a new all-time high above 150 exahashes per second last week despite the drop in BTC prices

Bitcoin mining is more profitable compared to the competing SHA-256 protocols, most of which are Bitcoin forks

There is increasing participation from miners outside of China and the United States; Canada and Kazakhstan are rising mining hubs

Share this article

Miners continue to ramp up their operations as BTC mining profitability remains high compared to other SHA-256 cryptocurrencies. Several other factors point to continued increases in the Bitcoin hashrate.

Bitcoin Hashrate Follows Price

“Hashrate follows price” is the usual narrative among miners, since Bitcoin prices determine mining profitability. Miners switch their machines off when prices drop and turn them on when prices are rising.

However, the recent surge in hashrate to an ATH of 150 EH/s happened while BTC plummeted 24%. This behavior suggests that miners are confident in further price appreciation. Thomas Heller, an expert on Bitcoin mining working at HASHR8, said in a correspondence with Crypto Briefing:

“Most mainstream models of Bitcoin mining are profitable. I’ve even seen miners picking up huge quantities of S9 in bulk, those with cheaper power are able to run them efficiently.”

Bitcoin price is currently at par with its pre-halving pump levels around $10,000 in May. Moreover, it surged to a peak at $12,475 on Sept. 1, with prices staying above $11,000 for most of August, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by entering futures and options contracts.

The delivery schedule for newer models of Bitmain and Whatsminer machines is also fast approaching, with their latest models already going out to buyers. Heller added:

“People who bought machines earlier in the year receiving the delivery now are in a hurry to install them. So plenty of miners with new jams from Bitmain and Whatsminers are causing the rise in hashrate.”

Forks in Decline Relative to BTC

Moreover, the price drop in other SHA-256 protocols like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV was steeper than BTC, motivating miners to switch their machines from these forks to Bitcoin proper.

One such drop was that of the obscure fork Bitcoin Vault (BTCV). The altcoin dropped over 73% from $450 levels attained in August. The corresponding increase in BTC.com pool of 7-8 EH/s at the beginning of the months seems to be coming straight from the Bitcoin Vault miners from Minebest and Mining City.

“It appears related to Minebest/Mining City/BTCV hashrate. BTCV is the Bitcoin fork that Mining City offers cloud contract plans for, and with the large price drop in the past few days, it’s likely that they have switched miners to mine BTC instead of BTCV,” Heller tweeted.

Rising Global Interest in Cryptocurrency

The industry is seeing an increase in interest from firms and governments in the USA, Canada, and Kazakhstan. The government of Kazakhstan is reportedly investing in cryptocurrency infrastructure, beginning with the installation of a 180 MW mining facility in Ekibastuz.

Earlier this month, Marathon, a publicly listed mining company in the United States, announced the installation of 1,360 new-gen ASIC miners: 700 WhatsMiner M31S+ and 600 S19 Pro Antminers. It also plans to increase its total hashrate a reported tenfold by next year through an acquisition of Fastblock’s 3,300 ASIC miners.

Riot Blockchain, another prominent miner in the United States, aims to quadruple its hashrate to 2,000 PH/s with the procurement of 13,100 S19 Pro miners from Bitmain by June next year.

Even if Bitcoin prices slide further, miner capitulation looks unlikely. It seems that miners are optimistic about the future of BTC.

Bitcoin is a great store of value, especially if you're looking to store about US$10,000 to $12,000 of value per unit.

While it's still kind of tough to picture Ethereum overtaking, or flipping, Bitcoin's market cap, Ethereum's DeFi-driven growth spurt has put enough pieces in motion to paint a cogent picture of how ""the flippening"" could play out in reality.

The main catalyst is the large amounts of Bitcoin wrapped on Ethereum. For succinctness, we'll just refer to all Bitcoin on Ethereum (renBTC, wBTC etc) as ""wrapped Bitcoin"" from here on out.

Depending on how you look at it, wrapped Bitcoin is either a relatively successful money-type token on Ethereum, or Ethereum is now Bitcoin's most successful sidechain.

The contest is not remotely close either. There is now about a billion dollars of Bitcoin in total on Ethereum according to DeFi pulse, in contrast with just $26 million on Liquid and $11 million on Lightning. And unfortunately for Bitcoin, every coin wrapped onto Ethereum is probably good news for ETH and bad news for BTC.

Follow the money

Using and moving wrapped Bitcoin incurs gas fees, paid in ETH. It also does away with the need to pay transaction fees with BTC. So right off, the likely overall effect of more wrapped Bitcoin is greater demand for ETH and less demand for BTC, and the balance keeps shifting as more BTC is wrapped.

In a future where most Bitcoin is wrapped on Ethereum and you don't even need BTC for transaction fees, there's little practical reason to own any Bitcoin at all, other than to try selling it at a profit, while there's still a clear reason for Bitcoin users to keep ETH on hand for network fees and staking.

Along the way, a number of Bitcoin owners will likely reconsider the merits of storing value relative to gaining value, as the gas in their wallets outperforms their money.

Other than the natural impact this could have on BTC-ETH prices, it also starts skewing Bitcoin's economics and potentially undermining its network security, which then chips away at the remaining reasons (""sound money"", ""world's most secure network"", etc) to keep hanging on to it.

And who's going to pay for it?

Bitcoin's mining rewards are meant to become increasingly dependent on transaction fees over time, as each halving cuts the revenue earned from newly minted BTC.

But now that we've seen Bitcoin in action for a decade, we can see that this probably isn't a viable solution in the long run, on account of how transaction fee markets shake out in the real world.

This isn't – or wasn't – really a problem though, because as long as Bitcoin prices don't do anything too catastrophic there are still 30 or 40 years to go before block rewards are low enough for this to be an issue, assuming Bitcoin prices continue to rise.

More wrapped Bitcoin accelerates that timeline though. Although it varies widely from day to day, about 10% of a Bitcoin miner's income comes from transaction fees these days.

If that transaction fee revenue continues shifting to Ethereum, miners start feeling it. Combine that with the probably detrimental impact of wrapped BTC on Bitcoin prices, and you get a glum forecast for the Bitcoin mining business and by extension network security in coming years. It certainly doesn't help that Bitcoin miners still have to keep selling all their coins all the while, as Ethereum plans to be cheerfully burning a portion of its much larger transaction fees down the line.

Naturally, there are still plenty of what-ifs and asterisks around everything, and it's difficult to predict Bitcoin's staying power as a collector's item in the long run. But if we just observe today's trends and the economic wheels in motion here, and extrapolate wildly from that, the idea of Ethereum flipping Bitcoin stops seeming hypothetical and starts looking like a safe common sense bet.

The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is soliciting proposals from contractors that believe they can develop technologies able to shatter the privacy surrounding cryptocurrency transactions.

The IRS solicitation was made public last week, as reported by Coin Telegraph, and has been made on behalf of the IRS' Criminal Investigation department (IRS-CI).

IRS-CI is involved in criminal investigations and has played a role in the takedown of Dark Web marketplaces, money laundering programs, and trafficking rings.

Cryptocurrency-related crimes, too, are on the department's radar. Virtual coins including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR) are often demanded as blackmail payments by ransomware operators; cryptocurrency trading posts are targeted by threat actors and funds stolen; exchange operators perform exit scams and run off with user coins, and crypto may also be used in the Dark Web to purchase illegal items.

While cryptocurrency has rapidly become a legitimate and innovative industry in its own right, the use of blockchain technologies and the emergence of privacy-focused coins that aim to prevent transaction tracing is of concern to the IRS and law enforcement.

The agency says that Monero, in particular, is rapidly becoming popular with cybercriminal groups, noting that ransomware group Sodinokibi has now moved from Bitcoin to Monero due to ""privacy concerns.""

""The use of privacy coins is becoming more popular for general use, and is also seeing an increase in use by illicit actors,"" the IRS says. ""Currently, there are limited investigative resources for tracing transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins such as Monero, Layer 2 network protocol transactions such as Lightning Labs, or other off-chain transactions that provide privacy to illicit actors.""

IRS-CI is asking for proposals from one or more contractors to ""provide innovative solutions for tracing and attribution of privacy coins and Layer 2 off-chain transactions,"" including tools, software, data, and algorithms.

Prototypes and suggested methods to trace cryptocurrency transactions should including tracking capabilities for law enforcement, predictive analytics, and should have as little reliance on vendor-specific technologies as possible.

""All solutions must support open standards for interoperability (common file formats, REST APIs, etc. as appropriate) to facilitate easy integration into internally developed IRS-CI cryptocurrency analytic systems and data.""

The IRS is offering a $500,000 grant after a prototype and an ""initial working system"" has been submitted. Contractors are then given eight months to work on their projects, with a further $125,000 awarded on deployment.

In its current form, the DFA law essentially provides legal status to digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), but prohibits their use for payments in Russia.

As the DFA law is poised to be officially adopted in less than four months, Cointelegraph talked to major crypto firms operating in Russia to get their take on how the new law can impact their business.

Based on comments from executives at companies like Binance, Waves, Paxful, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex, companies aren't exactly scrambling to adapt to the new law, largely due to its ambiguous language.

Many in the industry don't understand the new law

Anton Kozlov, head of the Russian market at Paxful, said that the DFA law has caused a lot of confusion. “Unfortunately, we could not say with certainty that the new law is clear to the industry,” Kozlov said. The executive added that the full impact of the new legislation “is not entirely understood by the industry players.”

Despite the apparent regulatory uncertainty associated with the law, Paxful does not expect it to affect its business because payments is not the core service on the platform:

“Most of the people on the Paxful platform are exchanging cryptocurrency and looking for arbitrage opportunities in the market.”

As reported, Paxful saw a massive spike of interest from Russian users this year. According to Paxful data, the platform’s crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in Russia surged as high as 350% on a year-over-year basis. According to Kozlov, the main reason for the surge is the weak status of Russia’s national currency, the Russian ruble, which “is not a very attractive savings option.”

“Crypto and P2P markets especially, can help solve these personal finance problems and offer people alternative ways to financial freedom, which is why we are seeing a spike in Russian interest on our platform,” he said.

Alexander Ivanov, founder and director of Waves Platform, said that the law has essentially no impact on the industry due to the lack of regulatory clarity:

“The law is hardly clear to the majority of players in the crypto and blockchain industry [...] At this point, the law is having neither a negative nor a positive impact on the Russian crypto industry, mostly because there's no explicit ban on crypto assets, which is the most important.”

Ivanov also noted that regulatory uncertainty is a major impediment to the development of the fast-growing industry of decentralized finance, or DeFi. “Against the backdrop of overall growth in the DeFi segment, an absence of a clear status or rules of the game for cryptocurrencies can be seen as an obstacle to the development of this industry and the Russian economy at large,” Ivanov said.

Shifting to new business models is not a deterrent

Dominique Simon, global general counsel at British crypto payment processor Wirex said that the firm does not anticipate any big changes in its business. “Facilitating crypto payments is only one part of the services we provide at Wirex and disabling this feature will not discourage us from providing services to Russian customers,” Simon stated.

Simon also stressed that at least some regulation is better than nothing, claiming that the DFA law is a “big step towards business certainty and security for our customers.”

He said, “We remain optimistic about providing our services to Russian customers, and once there is more clarity about the licensing regime, we will do our best to navigate the new framework and continue to establish a strong presence in the Russian market.”

On May 19, Wirex launched crypto purchases with fiat credit and debit cards in Russia, allowing users to buy Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) through Visa and MasterCard.

Some see the DFA law as a cause for celebration

Jukka Blomberg, CMO at Finland-based P2P crypto trading platform LocalBitcoins, is confident about the new law, stating, “We welcome the new legislation and see it as positive for Bitcoin and the whole cryptocurrency industry in general.”

According to Blomberg, LocalBitcoins has not seen significant changes on its platform since the law was passed. “Yet the official endorsement to allow people to buy and sell cryptos certainly excites us and definitely creates new opportunities for us as well as the other players in the industry,” he said. As reported, Russia was the top market for LocalBitcoins this year as of June 2020.

Binance still plans to launch its crypto card in Russia

Despite Russia being poised to officially ban cryptocurrency payments in 2021, Binance is still planning to launch its Binance Card in the country. Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations for Russia and the CIS, announced the plans to Cointelegraph on Sept. 7.

However, Kostarev said that Binance is not ready to either announce the anticipated launch date or provide any legal comment on the issue so far.

Binance’s plans to launch its card amid the upcoming crypto payment ban is probably the best example of the industry’s feedback to the country’s crypto legislation in its current form. The world’s largest crypto exchange is not going to give up its plans despite the law stipulating the following:

“In the Russian Federation, it is prohibited to distribute information about offering and accepting digital currency as a counterpart provision for transferred goods, rendered work (services) or any other method that allows one to pay in digital currency for goods (work, services).”

According to Kostarev, the current version of the law is “fairly neutral” and does not fully cover all aspects of cryptocurrency regulation. The adopted version of the law also “did not affect Binance's business in any way,” he said.

As reported, Russia is preparing to pass another law called “On Digital Currency,” or DC, in late 2020. In contrast to the DFA law, the DC bill will purportedly provide an actual regulatory framework for using crypto in Russia. On Sept. 3, Russia’s Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the DFA law to ban all crypto transactions except through inheritance, bankruptcy and enforcement proceedings.",,https://coingeek.com/has-jack-dorseys-square-crypto-realized-they-need-bsv/,"Square Crypto has launched the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a consortium in which member companies can use all other members’ patents for free. Square says they have created COPA because “opening access to patents covering foundational cryptocurrency technologies is necessary for the community to grow, freely innovate, and build new and better products.”

However, it is more likely that Square Crypto has realized that innovations that are crucial to building successful blockchain and digital currency platforms and services have already been patented and that they are hoping a few of the companies with these crucial patents—like nChain—will join their consortium so that others will have access to them.

What is COPA?

“COPA creates a shared patent library where members pool all of their crypto patents together to form a collective shield of patents, allowing members to use each others’ patents to deter and defend against patent aggressors,” said COPA in their official announcement. “This helps democratize patents for everyone, empowering even small companies with tools and leverage to defend themselves…We hope that COPA will transform the way patents are viewed and used in the crypto world, and that it will help patents contribute to further innovation and advancement of cryptocurrencies rather than operate as obstacles. We envision the organization evolving over time, and look forward to discussions and feedback from the community to realize this mission.”

But why would Square Crypto launch COPA now and not at the beginning of their business journey? It’s probably because Square Crypto realizes they can’t build a scalable, high-throughput product without tapping into an innovation that is patent protected.

As we learned from our conversation with European patent attorney and blockchain patent expert Cerian Jones, “A patent application is a commercial tool.”

Which makes the whole idea of COPA seem a little perverse. Companies intentionally patent their innovations because they know that they are crucial in creating a desirable product. Therefore, if a company discovers an innovation, they might patent it and require outside parties to license the patent if they wish to use their innovative technology.

Square is putting all of our crypto patents into a new non-profit org we’re calling the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, which will maintain a shared patent library to help the crypto community defend against patent aggressors and trolls.

Now that JPMorgan Chase is on board, will other traditional banks follow?

When a new digital currency called Bitcoin emerged in 2008 from the ashes of the worst financial crisis in living memory, many, like software engineer Niklas Nikolajsen, became overnight converts. In 2011, Nikolajsen moved to the crypto-friendly canton of Zug in Switzerland, where he then built up Bitcoin Suisse, a cryptocurrency financial services firm offering prime brokerage, custody, lending and ancillary services.

Others built cryptocurrency exchanges or businesses that enabled millions around the world to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies.

It hasn’t always been easy, of course; cryptocurrency exchanges have come and gone or been shut down by regulators, and bitcoin’s price has fluctuated wildly. During the “crypto winter” of 2018, it crashed from $10,000 to below $3,500. In mid-August, it passed $12,000. The cryptocurrency market is currently valued at more than $200 billion, but cryptocurrencies still have not cracked the mainstream.

Despite the challenges, Nikolajsen and other converts have managed to build successful businesses. From a humble startup in 2013, with just two student employees and a rented desk in the lobby of an office building, Bitcoin Suisse now boasts more than 140 employees and “banking-grade” offices in Zug, Copenhagen and Liechtenstein. In 2019, it reported net revenues of nearly $23 million. Yet, Switzerland’s oldest cryptocurrency financial services firm struggled to gain access to the banking services that traditional companies take for granted.

Typically, millions in annual revenues would at least get one through the door, but cryptocurrency firms report problems even getting banks to take their calls. Nikolajsen, in crypto-friendly Zug, where bitcoin can be used to pay for certain municipal services, told finews.ch in 2017 that he had approached more than 50 Swiss and foreign banks before finding one that would work with him.

“It’s difficult to get a bank account when you’re making 50,000 transactions a month,” says Mauro Casellini, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse Liechtenstein. “Not that many banks are open to that. They don’t have the compliance people who understand it or where the bitcoin is coming from. They don’t make a lot of money out of it, and they don’t want to take on the risk.”

Joe Ciccolo, founder and president of BitAML, an international compliance advisory firm exclusively serving the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, says only a handful of banks are crypto-friendly.

“A lot of banks haven’t taken the time to learn about crypto,” he says. “They have been dismissive.” In most cases, the firms simply want a deposit account, but they struggle to obtain even that. “Many [cryptocurrency firms] are so desperate for a bank account they don’t care who they bank with. They call around to banks, but before they can get a conversation going properly, they hear a click on the other end of the line.”

Cryptocurrency firms are not the only ones reportedly struggling to set up bank accounts and other banking services. Mark Hipperson, CEO and founder of UK-based Ziglu, a digital platform that allows customers to hold crypto and fiat currencies in a single account, says only a few business-to-business banks, including ClearBank in the UK, LHV Pank in Estonia and Silvergate Bank in the US are receptive to fintech startups. Silvergate, based in La Jolla, California, started servicing cryptocurrency firms in 2013. As of June 30, the company reported 881 digital currency customers. Fee income from digital currency customers for the quarter ended June 30 was $2.4 million, compared to $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2020 and $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2019.

“In terms of the current size of opportunity [from digital currency customers], it’s very significant for us,” says Alan Lane, CEO of Silvergate Bank, “but it’s probably insignificant for most of the larger banks.” Lane’s interest in digital currencies was sparked in 2013 when he bought some cryptocurrency. It didn’t take him long to figure out the opportunity for a small community bank to significantly grow its deposit base by servicing a niche nobody else appeared interested in.

Other financial service providers that aren’t afraid to hang their crypto-friendly credentials on their door include Liechtenstein’s Bank Frick, a private, family-run institution that was one of the first banks to offer trading and custodian services for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash; and New York’s Metropolitan Commercial Bank, where digital currency customers made up 4.2% of the deposit base as of the end of 2020’s first quarter. What is needed, however, is more banks that are willing to offer cryptocurrency firms transaction-banking services, says Casellini.

“It’s very difficult for a private bank to understand transaction banking,” he contends.

JPMorgan Steps In

An indication that traditional transaction banks could be changing their tune toward cryptocurrency came in May, when The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase had extended banking services to two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the US, Coinbase and Gemini. No further details were forthcoming as to why the bank, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once referred to bitcoin as a “scam,” suddenly decided to work with cryptocurrency exchanges. However, BitAML’s Ciccolo says Gemini and Coinbase are large, well-established players with a strong compliance ethos and staying power.

Nobody wants to be the first to do anything, says Ciccolo. But with the increased focus on digital innovation throughout the financial sector, banks are under pressure not to miss the boat.

“It is an opportunity to have interaction with some of the biggest and most influential players in the crypto space,” says Ciccolo. Those players that now have had the opportunity to learn and improve their game as a result of multiple regulatory examinations at federal and state levels. “The benefit of having these examinations is that it gives the exchanges a degree of validity.”

In a further boost for the nascent cryptocurrency banking business, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced in July that all nationally chartered banks were permitted to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.

“This announcement signifies a real acceleration in the embrace of the digital asset class and the value of digital currency solutions,” commented Robert Cooper, CEO of Digivault, which provides digital asset storage. “Not only does this represent a seismic development for crypto holders in the US, but it echoes a broader trend regarding the acceptance of digital assets amongst global regulators.”

Don’t expect the floodgates to open anytime soon as other banks rush to follow in JPMorgan’s footsteps, however. Most of the global transaction banks we contacted didn’t respond to a request for comment about banking services for cryptocurrency firms. Bank of America issued the following statement: “Bank of America Corporation does not lend against cryptocurrencies, and we do not bank companies whose primary business is cryptocurrency or the facilitation of cryptocurrency trading and investment.”

“Bitcoin is a currency with a checkered history,” says Ziglu’s Hipperson. “Many banks still believe it’s not worth getting involved in crypto because of the potential risk to their reputations and the costs associated with anti-money laundering [AML]. In the last five years, substantial fines have been levied on financial institutions because of problems with AML.”

Just how difficult is it for a conventional financial institution to bank cryptocurrency firms? Are they likely to find themselves in regulatory hot water if they dip their toes in the much-maligned cryptocurrency industry? Lane says it took Silvergate several months to understand what the compliance requirements were under the Bank Secrecy Act and other AML regulations. The results were heartening.

“We built a compliance program to address this specific client segment,” he says. “Regulators internationally are very interested in this. They did not try to discourage us.”

Whether mainstream banks get on board or not, bitcoin’s price, stablecoins (pegged to fiat currencies), and central bank-issued digital currencies are attracting interest. Lane believes more banks will therefore start offering services for cryptocurrency firms. And if they don’t, fintechs are likely to step in as another way to compete with traditional banks.

“Crypto is going mainstream,” says Hipperson, “but banks are always a little bit behind. They have to strike a balance between assessing and managing risk and taking zero risk.”",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/77555/crypto-to-fiat-gateway-xanpool-raises-4-3-million,"Crypto-to-fiat gateway infrastructure provider XanPool has raised $4.3 million in pre-Series A funding.

The round was led by OK Group, with participation from venture firms HashKey and Gumi Cryptos. With the fresh capital in place, XanPool plans to expand its operations into the Eastern hemisphere.

The goal of the amendments to the existing laws is to strengthen the legal process for the trading of digital securities. The parliament also hopes to restrict illicit activities, such as money laundering, by introducing firmer financial regulations according to a news report by Swissinfo.

“As of next year, Switzerland will have a regulatory framework that is among the most advanced in the world,” Heinz Tännler, President of the Swiss Blockchain Federation, told Swissinfo.

In particular, the amended securities law will incorporate the use of tamper-proof electronic registries, according to the report, although details pertinent to it will vary from contract to contract.

The regulator said in its complaint that T.I. -- whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris -- sold cryptocurrency tokens using his Twitter account and encouraged his followers to invest in the 2017 FLiK initial coin offering. He also falsely claimed to be a part-owner, the agency said.

IRS UPDATES CRYPTOCURRENCY TAX GUIDANCE

The SEC said the offering was a scam spearheaded by film producer Ryan Felton and, according to Mashable, Felton had promised to build ""Netflix on the blockchain"" but never delivered.

Instead, Felton used money from investors to drive up the price of a second token, SPARK, which he also controlled, the SEC said. Proceeds from the scheme were used to buy Felton a Ferrari, diamond jewelry, a home, and unspecified ""luxury goods,"" the agency says in its complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta.

""FLiK's promotional materials further promised that FLiK tokens would be redeemable on the FLiK platform for increasing amounts over the first year, with each FLiK redeemable for $3.99 after the first 3 months, $9.99 after 12 months, and $14.99 after 15 months,"" the SEC explained. ""No FLiK platform ever existed.""

According to the SEC, the FLiK initial coin offering raised approximately 539 ether, which was worth around $164,665 on September 20, 2017.

""T.I. also asked a celebrity friend to promote the FLiK ICO on social media and provided the language for posts,"" the agency noted, ""referring to FLiK as T.I.'s 'new venture.'""

Without an admission of any wrongdoing, Harris has agreed to pay $75,000 in a settlement. The 39-year-old will also sit out similar digital asset securities sales for the next five years.

T.I. is not the only celebrity to face regulatory action over cryptocurrency.

Key Takeaways Gemini crypto listed three new cryptocurrencies on Sept. 11 - PAXG, AMP, and COMP.

Compound‘s COMP token listing by Gemini marks the official entry of DeFi in New York, which even Coinbase NY users are exempted from.

The outstanding debt of DeFi lending is $1.6 billion of which Compound holds a dominant 45% share.

“The DeFi revolution is upon us,” said Tyler Winklevoss, a cofounder of Gemini, as the crypto exchange lists its first DeFi token.

Coinbase and Gemini Exploring DeFi Tokens

There is still no regulatory clarity around the application of securities law on cryptocurrencies.

Authorities have only laid down broad guidelines regarding the distribution and control of these protocols. As such, entrepreneurs are advised to consult the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before issuing a token.

And while regulators establish their formal position, many crypto users have been using a listing on Coinbase as a proxy for regulatory approval. Coinbase’s addition of COMP token on Jun. 22 marked the beginning of the current DeFi bull run.

Gemini has built a more conservative image than Coinbase over the years by further limiting its listings. Yesterday, Gemini added three cryptocurrencies to its list of eight, which already included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Zcash, DAI, Basic Attention Token, and Orchid.

In the announcement for the three new listings, the press release from Gemini reads:

“We have worked closely with the New York State Department of Financial Services to obtain approval to offer trading and custody services for these new assets”

Lending and Borrowing in NY

Gemini is one of the few cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain a Trust Charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), under the controversial Bitlicense. Bitpay, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Coinbase are among others that also qualified for the certification.

Users looking to buy and sell COMP on Gemini opens up the possibility of lending and borrowing on Compound in NY, as users are provided with the option to trade the earned COMP for using the platform. Even Coinbase users in New York are exempt from trading COMP.

With over $1.62 billion in outstanding debt on DeFi lending platforms, Compound accounts for 44.46% of the total debt. MakerDAO and Aave follow closely behind.

The price has fallen more than 8 percent and dipped below $10,000 on three consecutive days. Analyst Willy Woo, though, thinks it’s all looking good. He believes that on-chain indicators, such as the NVT ratio, suggest a bullish outlook, while Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital believes that a surge to $100,000 is more likely than a fall to $5,000.

The son of gold investor and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is convinced. The 18-year-old college freshman just bought some more Bitcoin, against his father’s advice. Asked whether they want to follow the student who’s never had a job or the 30-year investment professional, Twitter picked the Bitcoin fan.

At least the young Schiff will be set for the end of the world. Podcaster Adam Curry has told comedian Joe Rogan that the apocalypse is coming, and as you hide in your bunker and battle the zombies, you’re going to need a Bitcoin. It’s no wonder that Bitcoin is now the world’s sixth-largest currency. And that’s despite dying again. As the cryptocurrency lost value this week, the Bitcoin Obituary got to add another eulogy to its list.

As you’re mourning the 382nd death of Bitcoin, you might want to hold off on loading up on Bitcoin Cash, though. It turns out that Tim Draper didn’t recently buy some or thank Roger Ver. It looks like his Twitter account was hacked or a paid ad went wrong.

But if the apocalypse does come, maybe the GoodDollar will save us. The eToro token will set aside a daily amount as a basic income for the platform’s participants. Andrew Yang would like it. Or alternatively, you could just hack a wallet. Crypto Twitter user Alon Gal has declared that he has a wallet containing 69,000 Bitcoins. He just doesn’t have the password. Hackers have been trying to crack it for two years with no luck. Did they try “password123”?

The number of active decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, has jumped over the last year. It’s up 660 percent, from ten a year ago to 76 now. At the same time, the first phase of the MakerDAO debt auction is reaching its final stages. Bidders have already committed to buying $2 million worth of Maker tokens using Dai.

It’s not only DAOs that are on the up, though. Starbucks is now getting ready to deploy a blockchain to trace its coffee beans and enable greater product transparency. China’s Hainan Wenchang International Aerospace City will use a blockchain to support its Smart Brain Planning and Design Institute. And Bangladesh is about to get its first blockchain-powered remittance service. The service will let Bangladeshi expats in Malaysia send their money home.

There have been a few setbacks too this week. The Texas State Securities Board has detected some more cryptocurrency scams. Texas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles named Kumar Babu Bondesi and Darwin Eric Balusek as the alleged operators of the Forex Birds and PEK Universe scams. They could face up to ten years in jail. Balusek is also known as “Bitcoin Pope.”

And YouTube pulled the plug on Sunny Decree’s crypto livestream. The platform said the video violated its policy against “harmful and dangerous” content.

It seems there is a lot of turmoil happening in the world, as the year 2020 keeps giving and giving. From natural disasters, a global pandemic, and race wars and riots, everyone is wondering what will happen next. However, something happened earlier this year that resonated with me personally, and I wanted to touch on this subject as I don’t believe it has received enough attention and is a topic that in particular for this year, is important because of what’s going on around the world, especially in the cryptocurrency space.

Women in Tech

It’s not a big surprise for people to hear or know that women in the tech sector are at times, far and few between. Depending on the space you’re in, it may be hard to find other women in your office. For example, if you’re a female engineer, you may be the only one or maybe there are two in your entire team that are women.

According to an article written earlier this year by CIO, women make up 47% of all employed adults in the U.S., but only hold about 25% of technology related positions. Also, women who are working in the computing sector are typically paid less than their male counterparts. On top of that, women have a higher likelihood of facing discrimination in the workplace.

The struggle

Earlier this year, right when the United States was starting to get hit hard with the Corona Virus, there was news that hit crypto twitter – Binance is hiring and the only requirements are “beautiful young girls with big boobs.” You can imagine my shock.

Being a female in a male dominated industry where it’s already hard to get a name for yourself, I was just sent back years by one of the biggest exchanges in the crypto space. From the different news articles that popped up on the issue, it was discovered that Binance was hiring women so they could exploit them in order to potentially get new clients and customers.

The exchange was hiring them not because they possess the knowledge and experience to do the job, but they were hiring them strictly because of how they looked.

They later recanted what happened, saying they were joking about the job requirements, however, the damage was done. Women everywhere in the crypto space felt this, especially those of us who work for exchanges. Binance being a peer in the space, set the bar really low for all us, and now we have to work our way back up, whether it was a joke or not.

Currently there are over 30 million people unemployed in the United States, primarily due to the Corona Virus pandemic. This staggering number has many people worried, including myself. If you split that right down the middle, which it’s probably not a straight split, but to argue the point, let’s say there are somewhere around ~15 million women who are unemployed. Who do you think will be going after your job? With the bar set low, women are now facing an even bigger struggle to get employed and keep their jobs, especially in this booming space with lots of competition.

The Numbers

Being in the crypto space and working for another top exchange, OKEx.com, I have the personal experience and statistics to help paint the picture. Let’s take a raw look at some numbers to give you a firsthand view into who is using these exchanges.

As you can see, the number of female users (29.8%) that come and use OKEx is far less than the male users (70.2%).

For the age demographics of people using the exchange, 38% of the users belong to the age group 25-34, and 31% of the users are 18-24, making up nearly 70% of all the users on our platform.

The top countries that represent where the majority of our users are coming from are Indonesia, Russia, India, Vietnam, China, and Ukraine.

As a woman who works in the cryptocurrency industry, I think I have a different view of the situation. Every workplace has its own gender preference at an early stage, and it will become more diverse as time goes by and the company grows.

One of the challenges that I face is the worry about being treated less with less importance compared to a male employee with my voice not being heard every time.

One of my friends asked me the other day if people at my work even want to hear a female’s opinion? Frankly speaking, I have not experienced this kind of issue, but it is still a concern. I do feel I work in a very healthy, organic, and fair work environment. I can speak up anytime I want to express my opinions in the office. But not all work places are like this, and as others have shown, women are not always treated equally and fairly.

Overall, in the crypto community, I feel valued. Also, most of the people that I work with are very professional. But this doesn’t go without saying I have different challenges and issues to deal with being a woman and dealing with others who may not value what I have to bring to the table.

We have a long road ahead

I have to say that representation of females in the technology sector still has a long way to go before women are no longer considered a minority in tech, and it’s a similar scenario in the blockchain and crypto sector.

At OKEx, I’m glad to see other female employees, which there are plenty of. However, for web developers and engineers, it’s still far less below than what I would like to see, which is a general phenomenon across the whole computer science field. On my team, I am one of the rare female faces. This gender imbalance problem arises from school age challenges, all the way up to adulthood where women aren’t always treated the same.

My hope is that this will change as time goes on and new technologies emerge such as blockchain and crypto, which will help pave the way for women to give us an opportunity to make our mark.

Key Takeaways Crypto.com has launched a DeFi swap based on Etherum.

Users can trade cryptocurrencies or stake their holdings.

The service is separate from Crypto.com's custodial, centralized exchange, and offers users more control over their funds.

Share this article

Crypto.com has launched a DeFi swap service, which allows investors to trade their Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens.

Eight Coins Supported

The app currently supports eight coins: Ethereum (ETH), Compound (COMP), Crypto.com Token (CRO), Dai (DAI), Chainlink (LINK), USDC, Tether (USDT), and Wrapped ETH (WETH).

Cryptocurrency is drawn from a pool funded by various liquidity providers, and prices are adjusted to provide the “best available rate.”

In addition to swapping coins, users can stake their tokens through the app’s “pool” and “boost” features to earn interest on their holdings. Crypto.com offers higher rates to those who hold its native CRO token—a 20x bonus for those who stake in the highest tier.

The app has been forked from Uniswap v2, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX). Changes to the app have been audited by Crypto.com and by the blockchain firm SlowMist.

Crypto.com Commits to DeFi

This news comes just weeks after the platform announced plans to merge its old MCO token with its newer CRO token. That move was widely criticized because Crypto.com has quite suddenly imposed the change on its users.

The new, relatively open and decentralized coin swap tool could bring back users who believe the company’s centralized nature allows it to exert too much control at times. The swap app only requires Metamask or WalletConnect, not an account with Crypto.com’s custodial exchange.

“We believe that blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols built on top have the potential to empower millions to exercise this right,” Crypto.com states on its website.

“There are indeed responsibilities that come with [Ethereum 2.0 staking]. You can’t just stake and leave it. You need to run what we call a client or a validator software.”

That’s Ben Edgington, the product owner of Teku at ethereum venture capital studio Consensys. Teku is one of five software clients currently being battle-tested on the official Ethereum 2.0 test network, Medalla.

These clients will connect users to the highly anticipated proof-of-stake blockchain aimed at significantly boosting Ethereum transaction speeds and throughput. Ethereum 2.0 clients like Teku will also enable users to earn rewards as validators on the new network.

Similar to the role of miners on the current Ethereum blockchain, validators on Ethereum 2.0 will be responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks. What that looks like in practice, according to Edgington, is keeping client software up and running 24/7 on a dedicated computer device.

As for which of the five clients to run, Vijay Michalik, a strategist for the engineering team behind Teku, explained the technical differences between them all were minor. However, their main distinction between clients in the eyes of Michalik comes down to long-term development vision.

“For Status [the Ethereum messaging company], the Nimbus client is focused on trying to build a client for a low-footprint system. So they’re building for embedded systems such as mobile devices and potential IoT [Internet of Things] in the future,” said Michalik. “At the ConsenSys protocol engineering, we’re trying to lean into our specialization which is building the enterprise grade [Ethereum 2.0 client].”",2020-09-12 14:00:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sanctions-russians-cryptocurrency-presidential-election/,"US Sanctions Russians Allegedly Using Cryptocurrency to Influence Presidential Election

Three of the four people designated — Russian nationals Artem Lifshits, Anton Andreyev, and Darya Aslanova — are employees of the Russian troll factory known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the announcement notes, adding:

They supported the IRA’s cryptocurrency accounts. The IRA uses cryptocurrency to fund activities in furtherance of their ongoing malign influence operations around the world.

The Treasury Department has previously designated the troll factory and its Russian financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The latter was designated for “providing material support to the IRA’s influence activities against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.”

Lifshits was also separately charged by federal prosecutors Thursday. He allegedly serves “as a manager in ‘Project Lakhta,’ a Russia-based effort to engage in political and electoral interference operations,” according to the announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The Justice Department explained that since 2014, “Project Lakhta has sought to obscure its conduct by operating through a number of entities,” including the IRA. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers described:

Artem Lifshits, conspired with others to steal Americans’ identities and use them to open fraudulent bank and cryptocurrency accounts.

Prosecutors say, “Lifshits and the conspirators allegedly used these fraudulently opened accounts to both promote Project Lakhta’s influence operations and for personal enrichment.”

The fourth person sanctioned on Thursday was Andrii Derkach, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament who has been an active Russian agent for over a decade and has retained close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services, the Treasury Department alleges. According to reports, he ran a campaign against former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claims that Derkach, and “other Russian agents employ manipulation and deceit to attempt to influence elections in the United States and elsewhere around the world.”

The Treasury Department’s announcement continues:

As a result of today’s designations, all property and interests in property of these targets that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked.

The Treasury Department also updated its OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SDN) with details of the four individuals named above and their cryptocurrency addresses. Furthermore, “U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,” the announcement emphasizes, declaring that “Additionally, any entities 50 percent or more owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked.”

According to reports, Russia has refuted the claims that it attempts to interfere in the U.S. elections. Meanwhile, Microsoft has reportedly identified hackers linked to foreign countries, such as Russia, China, and Iran, attempting to infiltrate both President Donald Trump’s and Joe Biden’s campaign camps.

Rapper TI and four other people, including film producer Ryan Felton, have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over fraudulent token sales. TI, or Tip as the rapper is also known, is also fined $75,000 by the securities regulator.

Rapper TI and Film Producer Charged

The SEC announced Friday the charges against rapper and actor Clifford Harris Jr. (often known as TI or Tip), film producer Ryan Felton, and three others over two fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs). The SEC also charged two companies, Flik and Coinspark, that conducted the sales.

Rapper TI, whom the SEC described in its order as “a well-known musician, actor, and producer,” participated in the offer and sale of flik tokens, which are unregistered securities. Investors were able to buy and sell these tokens on at least two cryptocurrency exchanges using ETH and BTC, the SEC detailed. “Promotional materials described Flik as ‘Netflix on the blockchain’ — a company that would provide a streaming media platform with products and services that could be purchased with flik tokens.”

The SEC alleges that between Aug. 20 and Sept. 20, 2017, the rapper offered and sold these tokens on his social media accounts, falsely claiming to be a Flik co-owner, and asked a celebrity friend to promote the sale on social media, calling flik TI’s “new venture.” The Flik sale raised approximately 539 ETH, worth about $164,665 as of Sept. 20, 2017, the SEC’s order states, adding:

The SEC’s order against T.I. requires him to pay a $75,000 civil monetary penalty and not participate in offerings or sales of digital-asset securities for at least five years.

TI neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings, Reuters reported Friday. His attorney Henry E. Mazurek says that the rapper regretted getting involved with Felton, whom he “believed to be a local entrepreneur trying to make it easier for new artists to enter the music industry,” the news outlet conveyed. The lawyer additionally claims that TI “never received a dollar” from Felton’s failed venture.

In addition, the SEC detailed that film producer Felton allegedly promised to build a digital streaming platform for Flik and a crypto trading platform for Coinspark, but he misappropriated the funds raised. He secretly transferred flik tokens to himself and sold them for $2.2 million in profits. He also engaged in manipulative trading to inflate the price of spark tokens and used the ill-gotten gains to buy a Ferrari, a million-dollar home, diamond jewelry, and other luxury goods.

The complaint charges Felton with violating registration, antifraud, and anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws. Flik and Coinspark are charged with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions.

Besides Felton, all persons have agreed to settlements to resolve the charges against them. Meanwhile, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia has simultaneously brought criminal charges against Felton. The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.

“The federal securities laws provide the same protections to investors in digital asset securities as they do to investors in more traditional forms of securities,” said Carolyn M. Welshhans, Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement.

Apple Inc. has censored some cryptocurrency features of the Coinbase app. Specifically, Apple has blocked Coinbase from adding to its iOS app the ability to earn money using cryptocurrency and access to decentralized finance (Defi) apps.

Apple vs. Coinbase

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been struggling to get some functionalities approved for its iOS app, CEO Brian Armstrong detailed his company’s experience dealing with Apple Inc. on Friday. “In the wake of other companies struggling with Apple’s App Store restrictions, I want to share a bit about Coinbase’s own struggle here,” he began, elaborating:

Here is the issue. Apple has told us we cannot add the following functionality in our iOS apps: (1) the ability to earn money using cryptocurrency and (2) the ability to access decentralized finance apps (sometimes called Defi apps or Dapps).

“We’ve tried discussing this through regular channels with Apple, and I reached out directly to leadership to request a dialog, but we seem to be at a dead end,” he shared on Twitter.

Armstrong criticized Apple for disallowing iOS users the choice of earning through cryptocurrencies during this coronavirus-led economic crisis. “There are many unbanked and underbanked people in the world who have no ability to get a loan to buy a home, or start a business, so this kind of technology has enormous potential to improve the world over time, even if it is still early days,” the CEO wrote.

He further revealed that Apple has prohibited Coinbase from providing a list of decentralized apps to users on the iOS platform, claiming that the Coinbase app “offers cryptocurrency transactions in non-embedded software within the app, which is not appropriate for the App Store.” However, Armstrong maintained: “Dapps or Defi apps are fundamentally just websites that you can access through any browser. So Apple is essentially saying you can’t provide users with a list of websites they can visit through an app.”

Gabor Gurbacs, the digital asset strategist and director at Vaneck and MVIS, explained: “Apple is a company and the Appstore is their own product/property, not a public utility. It often feels like some product and services should be more open or easier to use but ultimately it’s the company’s/owner’s decision … similar to how Coinbase decides which tokens to list.” Lawyer Jake Chervinsky commented: “Apple wants to be your bank. Defi is bad for business.”

Nonetheless, Coinbase’s CEO emphasized that his company’s iOS apps are not missing some features that users want because his teams have not gotten to them, but because “those features are being censored by Apple.” Armstrong continued:

Apple also has a conflict of interest in applying these app store restrictions. While they are ostensibly designed to protect customers, it increasingly looks like they are also protecting Apple from competition.

“Forcing users to use the App Store instead of Dapps (websites), or IAP [in-app purchase] instead of crypto payments, reminds me of what Microsoft did back in the day (forcing users to use IE if you were on Windows) which led to all their antitrust issues,” the Coinbase CEO opined. “Apple, it’s time to stop stifling innovation in cryptocurrency.”

This week, we were told that the 60-day correlation between gold and bitcoin (BTC) had reached all-time highs. Last week, our monthly report featured a chart of BTC’s correlation with the DXY dollar index. A few weeks before that, the correlation with the S&P 500 was in the headlines.

If you feel dizzy from the rapid turns in attention on which correlation metric matters, you’re not alone. But, you had better get used to it because the fascination with BTC’s correlation status is unlikely to fade any time soon.



What this reveals about bitcoin is intriguing. It’s not so much the correlation measures per se – they are fun to watch go up and down, but they’re not the deeper story. The deeper story is why it matters so much to us.

When we point to BTC’s increasing correlation with the S&P 500, gold, avocados or whatever, we are searching for a handle on its prevailing narrative. We hope that correlations will give us a clue.

BTC is a difficult asset to pin down. It is a scarce asset like gold, yet with a harder cap. It can be used for pseudonymous transactions, as can cash. It is a speculative holding for many, like equities. It is a bet on a new technology, like a growth stock. It is a hedge against a dollar collapse, a way to spread financial inclusion, an investment in financial evolution, a political statement. It is all of these, or none of these, depending on your intellectual leanings, economic philosophy and mood.

The narrative we choose for bitcoin matters, though. Not only does it form our investment thesis around the asset, but it also influences our valuation methods. Do we extrapolate its potential price using the size of the gold market? The payments universe? Transaction fees? Something else entirely?

So, faced with such a slippery narrative, we look to correlations to tell the story. If it’s highly correlated with gold, then the market views it as a safe haven. If it’s more closely correlated to the S&P 500, then it’s a risk-on investment. If bitcoin’s correlation to the dollar index plummets, then it’s a hedge.

We look to the market to tell us what bitcoin’s narrative is. But this creates a feedback loop (Follow gold! Follow Nasdaq!) that helps to perpetuate bitcoin’s momentum-fueled volatility, and which is often thrown off course by the evolving nature of markets.

Make it a good one

BTC’s 60-day correlation with the S&P 500 has been coming down recently. That must mean it’s no longer a risk-on asset. Its increasing correlation with gold corroborates that, putting BTC back in the safe haven story.

Source: CoinDesk, FactSet

But wait. You’ll have heard that BTC has not had a good run over the past few days. You’ll probably also have heard that Tesla has had a particularly bad time this week. I wonder if they’re correlated.

Source: CoinDesk, FactSet

What do you know, it looks like BTC’s correlation with TSLA is increasing! BTC is now more correlated to TSLA than to the S&P 500. That must mean that bitcoin is now being seen as a tech stock. No wait, it’s being seen as a proxy for market hype. No wait, I mean it’s being seen as a moon shot.

Obviously, I’m kidding, but point I’m trying to make is that short-term correlations can tell a good story, but they’re not that meaningful.

With a happy ending

Correlations are based on price movements, which, especially in these crazy times, do not always respond to common sense. Prices have, on the whole, become untethered from fundamental factors and are being pushed around by sentiment. Sentiment fuels momentum, which we often mistake for a trend; it also perpetuates the directionality of prices, which can exaggerate correlations.

Yet, sentiment can turn fast when investors are jittery, and there’s plenty to be jittery about. The story changes again.

This grasping for data to back a story reveals our very human need to put bitcoin in context of things we’re already familiar with. If it goes into a certain mental box, it’s easier to understand and easier to make decisions about. Boxes are comfortable. Yet, in the long run, they are unsustainable.

In the short run, too: These markets are nuts, and boxes are being smashed all over the place. Bitcoin, which never did belong in any box that we know, is hopping from one story to another, as told by correlation metrics.

I like a good chart as much as anyone, probably even more so (after all, I am an analyst), and I plan to continue to watch the numbers stories with interest. But rather than use return relationships as a narrative crutch, I’ll be keeping an eye on what they say about what investors are looking for.

For short-term market movements, what we think bitcoin’s narrative is doesn’t matter as much as what other people think bitcoin’s narrative is. Other people move the market, so we should know what asset framework they’re using. The correlation stories are useful for that.

For long-term market movements, correlations matter more for portfolio diversification than for anything else. In the not-too-distant future, markets will hopefully be less confusing and even short-term covariance and other relationships might be steadier, and easier to use for planning purposes. By then, even bitcoin’s correlations might start to matter less for the story and more for the allocation calculations.

By then, we will hopefully no longer need to put bitcoin in a pre-conceived box. It will have found its own narrative, understandable by all.

Drawing lines

Investor activism comes to crypto. Technically it’s not the first time, but as far as I know it’s the first initiated by an institutional investor, which pushes it into a more public arena with potentially far-reaching consequences.

California-based hedge fund manager Arca is stepping up its campaign to overhaul decentralized exchange and prediction market platform Gnosis, which raised $12.5 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). Arca’s complaint is that the project has seen its initial ICO proceeds and therefore its balance sheet multiply simply due to the increase in the price of ETH, and yet has not produced any products that accrue value to the token holders.

Arca insists Gnosis should at least trade at the net asset value of its treasury, which is at current prices $139 per GNO (the platform’s token, which at time of writing has a market price of $67), and that the mispricing is due to poor decisions on the part of management. The investor has suggested to management that it use the bulk of its treasury to make a tender offer for all outstanding GNOs. This would value each token at approximately $90, providing a decent return for early investors. Since the report of Arca’s proposal came out last week, GNO has increased 34% in price (at time of writing), while bitcoin has fallen 4% over the same period.

The interesting part is not the potential flip for investors as they crowd out the upside. What’s important about this is how it changes the conversation around token investments, on so many levels.

First, it will unleash a healthy discussion around responsibility. Token sales, especially those issued in the heyday of 2017, are lightly regulated if at all, with no clearly defined lines of obligations. This discussion could professionalize the field and encourage other institutional investors to take an interest.

Second, it could refine the definition of “token.” Is it like a venture investment, where investors are expected to help their portfolio companies in exchange for greater potential returns? Yet venture investments aren’t liquid, and tokens to some extent are. So, is it more like equity, in which case, do token holders have stakeholder rights? Arca CIO Jeff Dorman believes his firm’s holding is like an interest-free loan, which comes with the expectation that lenders are kept informed of the borrower’s progress and plans for the proceeds. And, third, it could influence investment strategies. We’ve seen the price of GNO jump over the past few days, presumably in the expectation that management will listen to Arca’s demands. Will we see activists intentionally accumulate tokens in order to influence a company’s direction?

Finally, this could trigger some governance innovations. Apart from investors collectively insisting on more transparency and accountability, we could start to see some protocol or algorithm adjustments. What could investor activism look like on staking networks, where the amount of tokens you hold programmatically determines the say you have in certain governance issues? What if an investor wants to leverage that position to influence more than the protocol had contemplated? How can a project protect itself against predator stakes?

Given the scope of the problem and what it means for the evolution of token issuance as a fund-raising mechanism and as a value proposition, this situation is worth keeping an eye on. Arca’s initiative will most likely end up being about much more than a fair return on an investment.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

As the relentless growth in COVID-19 cases around the world shines greater focus on the bumpy road to a vaccine, uncertainty in the timing of an economic recovery seems to be spilling over into stock market valuations. The S&P and Nasdaq look on track to have their second week of declines, for the first time since March.

Amidst the growing uncertainty, BTC also had a down week, significantly underperforming gold and equities and giving a boost to its 30-day volatility.

While it may feel like stock market volatility is back with a vengeance, the VIX is still well below its June level, and about where it was in December 2018. In other words, this isn’t too unusual.

Both the latest U.S. unemployment and consumer price index figures came in slightly higher than expected, adding to the overall unease. As renowned investor Stanley Druckenmiller re-ignited the heated debate between those that expect inflation and those that expect deflation, expect greater focus on bitcoin’s narrative as an inflation hedge.

CHAIN LINKS

My colleague Nathan DiCamillo shows how we can follow the initial public offering of INX, the first registered offering of security tokens in the U.S., and gives more insight into how the issuance will work. TAKEAWAY: This is an eye-opening peek at the transparency of a security token offering, vs. a normal security offering. You can actually watch the securities move, in real time. That, plus the innovative business model behind them, and the evolution of capital markets they represent, and the fact that it’s the first token sale to register for retail distribution with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, make this issuance worth following.

Another issuance worth watching is that of Diginex, the Hong Kong-based company behind the newly launched EQUOS.io crypto exchange. This week it announced that it has raised $20 million from four family offices and a hedge fund, ahead of an anticipated Nasdaq listing later this month via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). TAKEAWAY: This will be the first crypto exchange to publicly list in the U.S., as well as an indication of public interest in crypto market infrastructure. For investors, it’s a listed play on the growth of the ecosystem. For analysts, it’s a welcome peek at the accounts of a market infrastructure participant, which could be even more interesting as rumors of a Coinbase listing continue to circulate.

Options market data shows an upward trend over the past couple of months in the traded volume of ether (ETH) puts vs. calls, which hints at a growing fear of a price drop. TAKEAWAY: The bitcoin (BTC) put-call ratio is flat over the same period, which implies that the hedging is specific to ETH. This could indicate greater concern about the fragility of the recent inflows into some decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and the potential impact on the network’s congestion and token price.

The recent growth in bitcoin “accumulation addresses,” or addresses with at least two incoming bitcoin transfers in the last seven years and no spends, could indicate growing support for bitcoin in spite of lackluster price performance. TAKEAWAY: That we can even extract this metric is an example of the unique data sets available to crypto asset investors. Imagine having this level of information with traditional assets.

Source: Glassnode

More than 30% of new customers at bitFlyer, one of the leading Japanese crypto exchanges, are in their 20s, according to a recent survey. TAKEAWAY: It’s not news that millennials are interested in crypto assets. Last year investment management firm Charles Schwab revealed in a quarterly report that bitcoin was the fifth most popular investment among its millennial customers. A JPMorgan report issued last month also flagged millennials’ penchant for bitcoin over gold.

Investment management firm Wave Financial has received its first round of investment from clients for the Wave Kentucky Whiskey 2020 Digital Fund, which it plans to tokenize in a year or two. TAKEAWAY: I include this as an example of how interesting the tokenized security field will soon get. It should be clarified that holding a fund token does not give you access to the whiskey. It does allow you to share in the profits when the whiskey is eventually sold to wholesalers. Yes, this could be achieved without tokenization. And it remains to be seen how comfortable investors will be with this concept. The investment so far is still relatively small, but will be worth watching.

Why Bitcoin Investors Aren’t Worried About This Price Pullback – Nathaniel Whittemore, The Breakdown

How Monetary Policy Undermined American Resilience – Nathaniel Whittemore, The Breakdown",2020-09-13 18:07:22+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/09/166712-cryptocurrency-open-patent-alliance-launched-by-blockstream-square-crypto-to-support-bitcoin-btc-development/,"Blockstream, a company focused on developing various products to support Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, claims that the flagship cryptocurrency is “under threat” from a body of patents being collected by firms operating inside and outside of the digital asset sector.

Blockstream argues that if some of these companies begin using their patent portfolios “offensively,” then the ongoing development of Bitcoin-related apps “could become very precarious.” The firm’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, and its CTO, Adam Back, note in a blog post that, in 2016, they had set up their defensive patent strategy in the form of their Patent Pledge.

The Bitcoin focused company states:

“Patents were an issue even prior to Bitcoin, where the adoption of various cryptographic technologies was stifled because of patent lockups—we wanted to do our part to ensure the same didn’t happen with Bitcoin. [For instance,] the Schnorr signature patent expired only in February 2008 and was the reason Bitcoin and other protocols used the less efficient ECDSA.”

Blockstream further noted:

“Taking our defensive patent strategy one step further, … we’re joining forces with Square Crypto in the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), announced [on September 10, 2020.] We’ll be committing all of our existing patents to COPA and will be interested to participate with the nine-seat board.”

As explained by Blockstream, COPA is a project that aims to establish a set of crypto technology patents that may be used for “defensive purposes” by its members.

Individuals and companies, which may have their own patents (or not), may join COPA. However, COPA members may only use their crypto-related patents for “defensive reasons,” the Blockstream blog post states. They’ve clarified that the Patent Pledge is “legally binding,” which should ensure the patents “safely become free to use for all, even non-members.”

Another requirement for those that want to join COPA is that members must “commit all of their cryptocurrency patents to a patent pool available for other members to also use defensively.” According to Blockstream, this should arm all members with an “arsenal of patents that acts as a lawsuit deterrent against aggressive actions from bad actors.”

The Blockstream notes:

“Bitcoin was founded on the principles of open finance and permissionless innovation. With COPA in place, Bitcoin startups and engineers will be able to get on with their important work with the peace of mind that other members have their backs when it comes to patents.”

(Note: for more details on Blockstream’s open patents and other info, check here.)

In addition to supporting Bitcoin development by protecting its ecosystem, large digital asset exchange firms like BitMEX have been issuing grants to highly-skilled BTC protocol developers",2020-09-16 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-bnb-neo-yfi-link,"This week Digital Assets Data CEO Mike Alfred told Cointelegraph that mainstream investors are still “skeptical of Bitcoin and the ecosystem.""

However, Alfred believes that this “skepticism and disbelief” will turn out to be a positive for Bitcoin (BTC) because when the “traditional folks capitulate, they will be forced by their clients and partners to get involved at significantly higher prices.""

While Bitcoin has struggled to start a sustained uptrend in the past few weeks, select altcoins and tokens in the DeFi space have been in a strong bull run. This shows that traders attention has shifted away from Bitcoin.

Pantera Capital founder and CEO Dan Morehead believes that the DeFi space will outrun Bitcoin in the next five years and grow by about 100x.

In the long-term, most analysts are uber bullish on the crypto space but what can traders expect in the next few days?

Let’s have a look at the cryptocurrencies that could offer short-term trading opportunities and spot the critical levels on each of them.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin completed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on July 27 when it closed above $10,500 and usually the price retests the breakout levels of such reversal patterns.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

In ideal conditions, the price should not dip below the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern, but trading is anything but ideal.

Although the bears pulled the BTC/USD pair below the neckline on Sep. 3, there has not been much follow up selling, which suggests buying by the bulls at lower levels. However, this buying dries up when the price tries to move up above the $10,500 level.

Due to this, the pair is currently stuck in the $9,835–$10,625 range. After the bears failed to sink the price below the range on Sep. 8, the bulls today attempted to push the price above the overhead resistance but failed.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($10,719) is just above the resistance of the range, hence, the bears are likely to defend it aggressively.

However, if the bulls can propel the pair above the 20-day EMA and sustain the higher levels for three days, it will suggest that the correction is over. That could result in a retest of $12,460 and if this resistance is crossed, the uptrend is likely to resume.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks and sustains below the $9,835 support.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $10,625 resistance but if they fail to sink the price below the $10,200 support, the bulls will once again try to clear the overhead resistance of the range.

If they succeed, aggressive traders are likely to jump in, which could result in a quick move to $11,400 and possibly $12,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the $10,200 support, a drop to $10,000 and then to $9,835 is possible.

BNB/USD

While most major cryptocurrencies are searching for a bottom, Binance Coin (BNB) has resumed its uptrend and made a new 52-week high, which is a sign of strength.

Although the relative strength index was showing the formation of a bearish divergence, the sharp move on Sep. 12 invalidated this bearish setup.

Currently, the BNB/USD pair is facing stiff resistance at the $32 level but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the critical support at $27.1905, a retest of $32 is likely. A break above this resistance could push the price to $38.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the pair down below $27.1905 it will indicate that the current move might have been a bull trap.

BNB/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are aggressively defending the $32 level as seen from the long bearish candle on the 4-hour chart. However, the positive sign is that the bulls are not panicking and they continue to purchase the dip.

They will now again try to push the price above the $32 resistance. If they succeed, the momentum is likely to pick up but if the price again turns down from $32, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.

NEO/USD

The failure of the bears to sink and sustain NEO below the breakout level of $16.72441 attracted buying by the bulls who pushed the price to $21.97869 today.

NEO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are defending the $22–$22.82612 resistance zone aggressively but if the NEO/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($18.54), the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the resistance zone.

If they succeed, the next leg of the up-move is likely to begin. There is a minor resistance at $25.23 above which the momentum is likely to pick up.

However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair might drop to $16.72441. A breakdown and close below this support will be a huge negative.

The failure to break above the $22 level could have attracted profit booking by the short-term bulls. This has pulled the price below the 20-EMA.

However, if the bulls can keep the price above $19.27244, (50% Fibonacci retracement level), then another attempt to clear the overhead resistance is likely.

A break below the $19.27244–$18.63376 support could weaken the momentum and result in a drop to $16.72441.

YFI/USD

The correction in Yearn.finance (YFI) that started on Aug. 31 found support close to $21,345, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire run-up from $3,000–$39,690.

YFI/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Repeated attempts by the bears to break below the $21,345 support failed and the range shrunk between Sep. 5 and Sep. 8, which suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears.

This uncertainty resolved to the upside with a sharp up-move on Sep. 9, which indicated that the bulls had reasserted their dominance. The target objective of this next leg of the uptrend is $46,632.46 and then the psychological resistance at $50,000.

However, the bears are attempting to stall the rally at $43,966.31. If they can sink the YFI/USD pair below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the rally at $31,011.37, the momentum is likely to weaken.

The developing bearish divergence on the RSI warrants caution but if the pair rebounds from the $34,068.74–$31,011.37 support zone, the bulls will make another attempt to resume the uptrend.

YFI/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have pulled down the pair below the 20-EMA, which suggests that the short-term momentum has weakened. The next support on the downside is $31,011.37.

If the pair rebounds sharply from $31,011.37, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $43,966.31.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) has thrice turned down from the $13.28 levels since Sep. 6 but the positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price below the trendline, which shows buying at lower levels.

LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the LINK/USD pair again rebounds off the trendline, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $13.28. If they succeed, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to the downtrend line.

This level is again likely to act as a resistance but if the bulls can push through it the pair could rally to $17.7777.

However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, it will suggest weakness, which could result in a drop to $8.908. Such a move will be a huge negative and it will hurt sentiment.

LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $13.28 levels but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the $11 level.

If the pair rebounds off the current levels or from the trendline, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the $13.28 resistance. If they succeed, momentum is likely to pick up and a quick move to $15 is likely.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the trendline.

From late March 2020, when the global pandemic Covid-19 paralysed many economies, the appeal of cryptocurrencies has grown. Several statistics show increased interest from downloaded wallet apps to peer-to-peer traded volumes. In many ways, this interest in bitcoin and altcoins is evidence that the policies of central banks are failing. Many professional investors, as well as ordinary people, are losing confidence in fiat currency systems.

However, many that are exploring the idea of investing in crypto alternatives are falling victim to scams. It seems more scam crypto sites are roaming the space than bonafide cryptocurrency businesses.

It turns out that criminals also appreciate the shifting dynamics and are aware that investing in bitcoin is the new in-thing. In fact, the FBI issued an alert in April warning potential investors to be on the lookout for cryptocurrency-related scams.

The start of the severe lockdown measures meant homebound individuals suddenly had more time to explore and experiment with different investment propositions. The challenge now is how to tell if a crypto-related website is genuine or not?

For the most part, it appears bitcoin-related scams employ similar tactics used by organised criminal syndicates to entice victims. There are some tale-tell signs that expose potentially scammy crypto websites which investors need to look out for.

The Lure of Passive Income

Any scam website would not be interesting if it fails to promise a healthy rate of return to investors for doing almost nothing. A typical scam starts by telling an investor that with just a small deposit, they will be guaranteed returns of 10% and above per month. As an extra inducement, the investor is told the interest earned will be compounded on a monthly basis.

Still, the mere mention of guaranteed passive incomes may not be enough to lure many investors. So in order to get even more people interested, the scam website must also promise investors a quick path to becoming the next crypto millionaire. Oftentimes, prominent individuals and businesspeople that became wealthy after investing in bitcoin are displayed on these types of schemes. The chance to become the next millionaire is enough to obscure any concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market that the potential investor might have.

Criminals are also aware that some in their target market might be hesitant to invest with an unknown entity. To get around this problem, criminal websites often display logos of reputable organisations. The objective is to gain the confidence of the more circumspect investors.

Therefore, when a site displays the logo of Visa or Mastercard, gullible investors will believe this to be an endorsement. Such perceptions usually erase any lingering doubts an inexperienced investor might have. The infamous Plustoken crypto scam had pictures of Prince Charles of the U.K. taken together with one of the masterminds displayed. The scam managed to steal billions from thousands of unsuspecting investors.

Next, testimonials by other investors that have already made unrealistic returns are also used to convince gullible investors to part with their funds. Tales of real people that turned a $250 investment to more than $10,000 in less a month helps to convince new investors to come on board. It does not matter that there is no way of verifying this because criminals also know that many people want easy money.

A Lax Registration Process

If an investor takes the bait, (and many do) they are asked to register or open an account for “free.” To complete the process, investors are asked to deposit funds that are needed to activate the trading account. After this, the funds may be converted to bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

However, once the transfer is made, the investor actually loses control of the funds to the virtual investing platform. At that point, the investor is at the mercy of the investment company. If the company decides to exit scam there will be no recourse for investors.

Meanwhile, when discussing the usual signs of fraudulent crypto sites in a Whatsapp group, one user says scammers’ registration processes sometimes fail to generate the confirmation email. Even more bizarre is getting an account verified without any form of KYC. Another user says other signs include promises of “super high returns of $120 in less than 24-48hrs usually 120% 150%.”

However, all scam websites have one thing in common, promises of riskless investing which is not possible. Every form of investment carries risks, the higher the anticipated return the higher the risk of losing everything. Every potential investor must be aware of this fact lest they get conned.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin developers successfully merged Schnorr’s improvement proposal BIP-340 with Bitcoin’s master library

Schnorr/Taproot soft fork is the next big update to Bitcoin after SegWit since August 2017

The update will be backwards compatible and usage will depend on demand from miners and users

Share this article

Bitcoin coding expert Pieter Wuille has successfully merged support for Schnorr signatures to BTC. The Taproot merger and the soft fork update are the final steps for smart contract implementation on Bitcoin.

The Hardest Part of the Upgrade Is Done

The merger of the pull request for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 340 (BIP-340) in the protocol’s master library marks an important milestone for the core development team.

secp256k1 now has an experimental module for Schnorr signatures (BIP-340). Pull request #558 by @n1ckler has just been merged after 558+1 comments by many many reviewers. 🎉 https://t.co/NbPqjwaBh0 — Tim Ruffing (@real_or_random) September 11, 2020

Leading Bitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier describes it as the “most complicated” part of the process.

“With that behind us, I expect the rest of the Taproot will follow smoothly,” he said in a correspondence with Crypto Briefing.

Dorier has already developed a simple smart contract using BIP-340, betting 1 BTC on the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections with Chirs Stewart. Smart contract functionality would mean that Bitcoin would have some of the same capabilities as other blockchains like Ethereum, EOS, and TRON.

What Does Schnorr/Taproot Bring to Bitcoin?

The Schnorr/Taproot soft fork will expand BTC’s functionality immensely: increased privacy, scaling, multi-sig applications, and even better transaction speed are all made possible by the upgrade.

“What Segwit is to lightning network (LN) compares with what schnorr/taproot is to multi-sig applications,” said Bitcoin dev Sanket in an interview with Crypto Briefing.

According to Sanket, the next step in the upgrade is the Taproot pull request merger, followed by the soft fork. The eventual decision will be left to miners and network demand, who may choose to run Schnorr/Taproot for smart contracts on Bitcoin or stick with the current version of the protocol.

Today, countries such as China and South Korea have become epicenters of blockchain innovation. However, in many countries, it’s still unclear whether cryptocurrencies are allowed, and if they are, what their status is.

So, here’s how the regulation of the cryptocurrency market in Asia is shaping up and what should be expected from governments in the near future.

China goes digital with the yuan

Today, China is home to many cryptocurrency projects and exchanges, and yet, crypto has actually been banned for several years now. In 2017, the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, banned initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges. Then the Shanghai branch of the PBoC announced its intention to root out the crypto industry in the country, equating the token sales to the illegal placement of securities or fundraising. Soon, the biggest crypto exchanges in the country, Huobi and OKCoin, announced they had stopped local trading.

The turning point came in July 2019 when a Chinese court ruled that Bitcoin was digital property. The court’s decision marked a shift in cryptocurrency adoption, and in October 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an increase in blockchain development efforts. Furthermore, the PBoC has said it’s prioritizing the launch of a central bank digital currency. However, the Chinese government is still quite cautious in its approach to both its own cryptocurrency and digital assets in general and has yet to issue regulations.

Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of exchange CEX.IO, believes that recent events in the world, such as the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, could push the Chinese government toward the legal adoption of cryptocurrencies:

“To maintain its status as leader in the tech and finance markets, China, which after being overly restrictive just a few years ago, now accelerates the efforts to create a legal framework to regulate cryptocurrency circulation and even considers the possibility of its own digital currency.”

But so far the government has not introduced a national digital currency, apparently due to the fact that it wants not only to introduce a digital cash replacement but also to create a universal payment system, such as Alipay, that will be used all over the world. At the moment, the PBoC is conducting pilot projects in the field of cryptocurrencies in several regions of the country and has registered at least a few patents related to digital currency.

In early August, it also became known that some of the country’s commercial banks are conducting tests with digital yuan wallets. At the end of the month, China’s Communist Party once again announced that it is betting on blockchain as a key tool for innovating nationwide social services.

Also noteworthy is that at the end of July 2019, a national project known as the Blockchain Service Network, or BSN, was launched to support medium-sized businesses in the development of blockchain projects by creating public blockchains that will comply with Chinese law and operate internationally. It was also announced that the BSN will integrate support for stablecoins, albeit no earlier than 2021, and will be able to become the infrastructure for the digital yuan.

Despite all of these positive signs of blockchain “acceptance,” some Chinese businesses still don’t believe that the government will legalize cryptocurrencies because digital money does not act as currency. Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology — a tech company involved in the BSN — told Cointelegraph:

“For China, it is for sure that in the foreseeable future, cryptocurrencies definitely won’t be legalized in China. Until today, I see cryptocurrencies as a form of investment, not really currencies. When some real currencies change hands, most of the time they are for purchasing merchandise or services. When most cryptocurrencies change hands today, 99% of the volume is for investment purposes. Therefore, of course they won’t replace fiat money because they are not functioning as currencies.”

Singapore regulates the way forward

The city-state of Singapore treats cryptocurrencies positively and doesn’t ignore them, and its financial regulators were among the first in 2020 to issue relevant laws within the framework under which the country’s crypto businesses operate.

In January, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation’s central bank, issued the Payment Services Act, regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies and the activities of related companies, which must comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism rules. Crypto companies must first register and then apply for a license to operate in Singapore. To clarify how to get a license, the Association of Cryptocurrency Enterprises and Startups Singapore has introduced a ""Code of Practice"" to assist companies in their applications.

The government did not stop at just issuing laws; it also began developing national blockchain projects. Earlier this summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that it was ready to test Project Ubin, its multicurrency blockchain payments project designed for commercial use and intended to facilitate more efficient cross-border payments. Moreover, in June, the central bank announced its readiness to cooperate with China in the creation of a CBDC.

At the moment, Singapore has clear legislation regarding cryptocurrencies, and no laws prohibit their possession, use or exchange for fiat currency. Registering a Singapore cryptocurrency company is also a legal matter.

South Korea

South Korea also has a clean-cut vision of cryptocurrencies; however, it approaches the regulation of digital assets in a very tough manner, viewing digital assets as legal tender. Its local exchanges are tightly controlled by government agencies, including the Financial Services Commission. In addition, the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance can conduct comprehensive checks of Bitcoin exchanges. Since September 2017, ICOs and margin trading have been banned.

In March, the South Korean government passed a bill to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. The National Assembly adopted a revised bill on reporting and conducting certain types of financial transactions, including crypto. The government has until March 2021 to implement the law. Once in effect, blockchain startups will be given a six-month grace period to bring their activities in line with the new rules.

The bill will affect crypto exchanges, funds and crypto wallets; companies conducting ICOs; and other market participants. They will be required to comply with all financial reporting requirements, use only bank accounts with real names, conduct user identification such as Know Your Customer, and certify their information security management systems. In July, the government suggested introducing a tax on income from crypto trading and even set a rate of 20%, but so far, the law has not been adopted.

As for the use of blockchain in private business, the government contributes to the development of this sector in several ways, including through the use of a blockchain-based payment program in the city of Seongnam and crypto storage by four of the nation’s largest banks.

Indian uncertainty

The relationship between the Indian government and cryptocurrencies can be confusing to understand. The Reserve Bank of India’s 2018 ban on accounting organizations serving firms that work with crypto drove some companies out of business. The government planned to go even further, and in July 2019, it proposed a draft bill that would slap anyone dealing with crypto with a big fine or a 10-year prison sentence.

At the end of March, the Supreme Court of India unexpectedly heeded petitions from crypto businesses and overturned the central bank’s ban, declaring it unconstitutional. Some exchanges immediately seized the opportunity to start trading again. However, the situation has remained ambiguous ever since, as it’s still not clear whether the Indian government will push to create a regulatory framework for the development of the industry.

So far, it seems that the authorities may, and want to, regulate this area, but they are hesitant, so another ban looks like an easier way. For example, just five months after the first ban was lifted, Indian officials reiterated the possibility of banning cryptocurrency trading through legislative changes.

Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX — an Indian cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph that in countries such as India where the adoption and legalization of cryptocurrencies have not been as fast as in South Korea or Singapore, it will take time for businesses to get used to a new financial instrument:

“Over the course of 2020, we have seen regulation shift from a ’blanket ban’ to a more measured and calculated approach aimed at protecting investors and combating potential fraud within the industry. We believe that as traditional actors are increasingly comfortable with cryptocurrencies, we will see an uptick in cryptocurrency adoption across nations and regions.”",

The price of bitcoin hit as high as $10,759 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase Monday. That level has not been seen since Sept. 3 and the cryptocurrency is now heading into bullish territory.

“The trend is indeed higher,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of quant firm QCP Capital.

Buy liquidations, the crypto equivalent of a margin call that wipes out short-sellers on derivatives exchanges such as BitMEX seemed to be helping to push bitcoin’s price up. A total of $19 million buy liquidations were more than double the $9.1 million in sell liquidations over the weekend and into Monday on BitMEX, helping fuel the price upswing.

In the options market, some traders remained highly bullish that bitcoin can hit new highs.

“While bitcoin price dabbles around $10,000 now, traders have still priced in a chance that bitcoin will trade at $20,000 by March 2021,” said William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts.

Indeed, based on how options are currently trading in the market, it appears as if options traders are estimating a 10% chance that bitcoin will be at $20,000 by the March 2021 expiration date.

Over in the futures market, investor interest seems to have waned somewhat.

“Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest has dropped $1 billion, or 20%, since the start of September,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.

However, Lau said a higher bitcoin price could mean an increase in futures interest. “It seems traders are in a holding pattern,” Lau added. “U.S. markets have had a strong opening this morning, which pushed BTC up 5%, so it will be interesting to see what impact that has on open interest in the coming days.”

Ethereum record gas usage

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $375 and climbing 3.2% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The total amount of “gas” (or costs) used on the Ethereum network to send transactions and interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols hit new highs in September. On Sept. 6, a record 80 billion units of gas was used on the network, and Friday (Sept. 11) was the second-highest usage day ever, at 79,743,954,147 units used.

“I have short-term concerns about Ethereum network congestion but it’s a positive for the long term because it shows demand,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of Eth Capital, which invests in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The short-term issues could cause pain from a usability standpoint, Mosoff added. “Realistically, until the second and third phases roll out in ETH 2.0, high gas costs or requiring the use of a supporting or competing network are going to be the reality.”

The world’s largest virtual currency by market capitalisation—bitcoin—is the most traded cryptocurrency in India.

Since March when the ban on cryptocurrencies was revoked, bitcoin accounted for 20% of the total traded volumes on WazirX, one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges in India. Over the last six months, bitcoins worth $184 million were traded on WazirX’s platform.

On CoinDCX, another popular crypto exchange, around 78% of the Indian users trade bitcoin since April this year.

“Bitcoin is the flag bearer of cryptocurrencies. Also, it’s more liquid and the less volatile compared to other currencies. Hence, most people come to the exchange to buy bitcoins,” says Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX.

Tether, which is seen as a stable coin as it is pegged against US dollar but this claim hasn’t been verified through a public audit, was the second most popular virtual currency on WazirX.

Bitcoin is one of the base currencies for buying altcoins if a user doesn’t want to use sovereign-backed money to trade. This too has pushed up the demand for Bitcoin.

Indians, who see cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment, usually buy bitcoin, whereas day-traders usually prefer other virtual currencies, which fluctuate heavily, Shetty of WazirX said.

What has further helped is the surge in the valuation of bitcoin after the outbreak of the pandemic in March as well as an endorsement from some Wall Street veterans.

As cryptocurrencies gain popularity in India, other virtual currencies will also start finding takers. For instance, ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, is gaining popularity on CoinDCX, said its co-founder and CEO, Sumit Gupta.

Like the US dollar and most other fiat currencies, Bitcoin isn't backed by physical assets in a vault, but instead by its value as a mode of payment.

The maths underpinning Bitcoin's blockchain contributes to its desirability in a number of ways.

The argument that Bitcoin (BTC) has no value because it isn't backed by anything physical remains one of the major misconceptions about the cryptocurrency.

It’s a view that has been perpetuated by US President Donald Trump as well as billionaire tycoon Warren Buffett—both of whom have been quoted denying that Bitcoin has any value.

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

But now that Bitcoin is the sixth most valuable currency, it does beg the question... What exactly is it backed by?

The source of value: Bitcoin vs fiat

Up until relatively recently (the last century or so), most ordinary paper currency and coinage was directly redeemable for gold. This is because many of the wealthiest countries followed a monetary system known as the gold standard, which saw governments lay down a fixed exchange rate for national currency and gold. As part of this system, countries needed to keep sufficient reserves of gold in their vaults to 100% back their circulating currency supply, ensuring that people could always exchange their currency for gold if they chose to do so.

However, this also constrained the economy in the middle of the Great Depression, since governments were unable to simply source more gold to expand their money supply and stimulate spending.

The system was abandoned by Australia and New Zealand in 1929/1930; Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1931; and the United States partially left the standard in 1933.

It wasn't until 1971 that the United States fully left the gold standard, after then-President Richard Nixon ended the interconvertability of the US dollar into gold, thereby nullifying the Bretton Woods system and essentially ending the age of the gold standard.

Instead, countries switched to a fiat model, where the national currency isn't backed by a commodity like gold—allowing central banks to print new money as and when needed. Although it doesn't have intrinsic value, the value of fiat money is set by changes in supply and demand, as well as the strength of the government behind it. Since governments only accept payment of taxes in fiat currency, and tax evasion is illegal, their value is also partially maintained by the need to pay taxes.

So while fiat currencies are not formally backed by anything, we tend to buy into our fiat currencies with the confidence that they will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for goods and services. Essentially, our confidence in fiat currencies generates purchasing power, and therefore value, for fiat currencies.

But our confidence in fiat currencies suffers from a problem of induction. In other words, we presuppose that a sequence of events will occur as it always has, based on our previous experience. We can’t really say for certain what lies ahead for the value of our traditional fiat currencies. Without a currency being formally tied to a commodity like gold, value becomes a contingency rather than a guarantee.

Is Bitcoin backed by mathematics?

Like the US dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by a physical commodity, and instead derives its value in other ways.

Since Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized entity that enforces its value and it isn't backed by any commodity, many people mistakenly believe that this means Bitcoin doesn't have any value.

However, Bitcoin currently has an individual unit value of more than $10,000, and a total market capitalization—defined as the unit value multiplied by the number of Bitcoin in circulation—of almost $190 billion, clearly demonstrating that it is considered valuable by a large number of people.

But Bitcoin isn't actually backed by anything physical—only the complicated mathematics that underlies its blockchain technology and controlled supply. This ensures Bitcoin remains limited in supply and is resistant to censorship—which imbues it with some of its value. As Anthony Pompliano said in a panel discussion on CNBC, “If you don’t believe in Bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography.” For Pompliano, blockchain technology endows Bitcoin with inherent value, almost like a gold standard for crypto.

The rest of Bitcoin’s value can be attributed to the fact that it was the first successful monetary system to operate without a centralized entity pulling the strings—meaning its supply can't be forcefully inflated, it can't be easily confiscated like gold was during the 1930s, and it offers a level of financial freedom that few (if any) fiat currencies can match.

Bitcoin has also been shown to have utility value; thousands of merchants now accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, and it’s shown to be less correlated with the stock market than many other assets—making it useful as a hedge.

The level of confidence seen in a currency can be indicated, or even preserved, by its level of usage around the world. Whether it is performing well relative to other fiat currencies, the US dollar is—and will be for the foreseeable future—a currency that can be spent almost anywhere. As a result, consumers are confident in the dollar. Purchasing power and practicality are valuable commodities themselves.

On the other hand, Bitcoin is still some way from the mainstream. The crypto community has come a long way since the first Bitcoin transaction was spent on a pizza, but until mass adoption takes place, confidence in Bitcoin will ultimately not be as high, or as widespread, as confidence in established fiat currencies.

Despite their obvious differences, Bitcoin turns out to be similar to fiat currency insofar as it is backed largely by consumer confidence. As the crypto space grows, so too will confidence in Bitcoin.

And since Bitcoin's market value is a direct result of fluctuations in supply and demand, that means it can appreciate significantly when times are good, but can also come crashing down if it falls out of favor.",2020-09-14 13:21:03,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-firms-swiss-franc-stablecoin,"The folks building the next generation of digital money in Switzerland understand the need to collaborate.

SEBA Bank and Sygnum Bank, the two B2B players that hold banking licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and that specialize in digital assets, are both involved in stablecoin explorations, as is the country’s respected crypto conglomerate, Bitcoin Suisse.

“Within the Crypto Valley and here in Switzerland, there’s a very good collaboration going on, where everyone’s working together to try to design a Swiss franc stablecoin which has more or less the same definition or is fully interoperable,” said Matthew Alexander, SEBA Bank’s head of asset tokenization.

“Coopetition” is an ungainly term at the best of times, while “interoperability” is a word that gets bandied about the blockchain world an awful lot. But it appears that’s what’s happening among Swiss stablecoin issuers.

The end goal, Alexander said, is that “you’ve got something which a consumer, or a central bank or a corporate can trade with anybody else because they know they have the same thing on the other side.”

The Swiss also see the advantage in avoiding the kind of separate and competing currency pairs that have emerged with USD stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC.

Swiss stablecoins

Sygnum, which works in partnership with telco giant Swisscom, recently claimed the world’s first e-commerce transaction using a bank-issued stablecoin, the Sygnum Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF).

“We are absolutely in discussion with other players in the ecosystem,” Martin Burgherr, co-head of clients at Sygnum Bank, said on the topic of stablecoins. “To the clients, it’s a new way to transfer assets via a blockchain and this requires some disruption, and disruption is easier if you not only compete but also team up on certain aspects. We think that there will probably be multiple stablecoins for multiple purposes, but agree that you don’t need 200 stablecoins with a Swiss franc common denominator.”

Bitcoin Suisse is no stranger to crypto interoperability, having led the OpenVASP network to harmonize global anti-money laundering (AML) standards. The firm’s Swiss Crypto Tokens AG subsidiary was the first of the three to come out with a Swiss franc stablecoin, the CryptoFranc (XCHF).

“Within the Swiss crypto industry, we are in frequent discussion with partners and other stablecoin issuers to see what cooperation and new use cases may make sense for the XCHF and how we can further adoption of cryptocurrencies in general,” said Armin Schmid, CEO of Swiss Crypto Tokens.

All three firms praised the support of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Asked for comment on the growth of stablecoins in Switzerland, a spokesman for SNB referred to a speech by the bank’s chairman, Thomas Jordan.

“We believe that cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-based tokens are of only limited use as payment instruments, stores of value and units of account because they are subject to major fluctuations,” he said last September. “The picture may be different for stable coins, however.”

Under the hood

Diving into the nuts and bolts, there are two levels of stablecoin interoperability, said SEBA’s Alexander. On the one hand, there’s the relatively straightforward technological design of the coins; on the other, the legal and regulatory underpinnings.

Stablecoins, normally built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, have an advantage in Switzerland because they tend to be regulated and audited by firms like PwC or Grant Thornton. Starting out with small projects and experiments, an agreed-upon set of rules and auditing capabilities can be defined.

“It literally becomes like an open banking API, and those who prove capable will be allowed to join the network,” said Patrick Salm, SEBA’s head of token platform. “A lack of collaboration will result in five standards and a race for a standard, which is not efficient.”

Standardized common languages are critical. For example, an attempt to implement a stablecoin such as tether (USDT) or USDC within a core banking system would not work, simply because such systems are not capable of handling a four-character currency unit, Salm pointed out. Currencies, according to ISO definition, are supposed to be three characters.

“It starts with stuff like this,” said Salm. “We’re not just talking about using a four-digit stablecoin as a settlement coin. … It’s really about the deep roots of banking.”

Eurocoin?

Naturally, interoperability is front and center when it comes to establishing a euro stablecoin, said Alexander of SEBA.

“We are trying to help design something that is truly interoperable,” Alexander said, adding:",2020-09-14 13:40:58+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/paxful-exits-venezuela,"Disclosure

This past weekend, data shows the most active bitcoin options contracts were calls for $28k, $32k, and $36k by the year’s end. This means a number of options traders are betting the price of bitcoin will exceed the all-time high (ATH) the decentralized currency touched in December 2017.

On September 14, researchers from the data analytics firm Skew.com tweeted about an unusual number of call options for December 2020 that are well above the 2017 ATH.

“[December 2020] $28k, $32k, [and] $36k calls among the most active bitcoin options contracts yesterday,” Skew tweeted. All of these calls are well above the mid-December 2017 ATH, which saw BTC touch $19,600 per coin.

The new open positions took place on the crypto-financial derivatives platform Deribit. The action took place after $570 million (notional) of BTC options contracts expired on Deribit on August 28.

There were 752 open positions for $36k, 462 contracts for $32k, and 230 for $28k. Additionally, some $9k and $9,750 calls were set for the end of September. Responding to Skew’s December calls tweet, one individual wrote:

Without opining the possibilities to this, it will be entertaining to revisit at the end of the [fourth] quarter.

Essentially, bitcoin options are crypto-derivatives products that provide a person or group with the right, but not obligation to buy and sell the BTC at a predetermined strike price, while also leveraging an expiry date. In these examples, set well above BTC’s prior ATH, a strike price is set and the expiry ends in December 2020.

In the August 2020 Deribit newsletter, the exchange said “even though competition has been picking up, Deribit remains the leader with ~79% of the total BTC Options OI held.”

Sharing a chart of the total BTC Options OI by expiry positions two days before the weekend, Skew said the traders are “Gearing up towards a pretty chunky bitcoin options expiry at the end of the month.”

“Already $750 million in open interest outstanding,” the crypto analytics firm Skew further tweeted.

The bitcoin data and insights researcher from Ecoinometrics has also been discussing bitcoin options markets stemming from CME Group.

While studying a number of markets and CME’s derivatives action, Ecoinometrics said that he doesn’t believe market sentiment has turned. “I don’t think so,” the blog post notes.

“If you think from a technical perspective what we are getting right now is Bitcoin flipping a former resistance level at $10,000 to become a support. From May to the end of July, Bitcoin was desperately stuck below $10k. But for [seven] days now $10,000 is holding strong.”

As far as the CME Bitcoin options market, the post highlights that “calls continue to dominate the scene with [five] calls for every [two] puts.”

The post further adds:

[It is] pretty clear option traders are buying puts on the front month to protect themselves or benefit from what they might perceive as a short term drop. But for the long term, the bullish sentiment is pretty much unchanged.

Monday’s BTC spot markets have been on a tear, rising more than 4% during the afternoon (ET) trading sessions inching toward the $11k zone again.

The jump in value has happened amid a number of uncertainties and macroeconomic events like the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors may be eying other unsettled events like the U.S. election and the country’s tumultuous dollar.

In a Twitter thread published on Sept. 11, Armstrong doubled down on his earlier claims that Apple continues to block some functionalities for cryptocurrency developers.

The CEO alleged that other cryptocurrency firms are “reluctant to speak out on these topics for fear of retaliation,” but that he feels the need to speak out as Coinbase has exhausted regular channels for dialog with Apple and has reached a “dead end.”

According to Armstrong, Apple has told Coinbase that it is prohibited from adding two specific functionalities to its iOS apps: the ability to earn money using cryptocurrency and access to decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.

The first restriction, which affects the exchange’s Coinbase Earn product, has reportedly led to Coinbase having to modify its app in a way that is significantly less user friendly.

We sometimes end up in bizarre negotiations with them, modifying the product, and asking users to jump through hoops (do a task on mobile, then move to the web to claim your reward!) to comply with their guidelines. This creates a worse experience for Apple and Coinbase customers — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 11, 2020

The CEO claimed that these restrictions are specific to cryptocurrency users, stating, “Why would Apple want to prevent people from earning money during a recession? They seem to not be ok with it, if it uses cryptocurrency.” For iOS users, Armstrong claimed, crypto apps lack features not because of developers’ inactivity but because those features are “being censored by Apple.”

In addition, Apple reportedly bars Coinbase from providing app users with a list of decentralized applications or DeFi apps, both of which “are really just websites.”

Apple’s justification for this has apparently been that “""Your [the Coinbase] app offers cryptocurrency transactions in non-embedded software within the app, which is not appropriate for the App Store.""

Noting that DApps and DeFi apps can regardless be accessed via a web browser on any smartphone, Armstrong claimed that Apple’s decision is motivated by a “conflict of interest.”

While these restrictions “are ostensibly designed to protect customers, it increasingly looks like they are also protecting Apple from competition,” he wrote.

By compelling users to use the Apple App Store instead of DApps, or In-App Purchases instead of crypto payments, Armstrong claimed that Apple’s actions have a parallel in Microsoft’s past antitrust issues when it compelled Windows users to use its proprietary browser, Internet Explorer.

During the coronavirus crisis, when underbanked or unbanked populations may face even greater difficulties accessing traditional financial services, Armstrong accused Apple of placing yet a further barrier to financial inclusion.

Apple, it's time to stop stifling innovation in cryptocurrency. We would like to work with you productively on this. Some day, cryptocurrency could even be integrated into IAP to give people in emerging markets better access to the financial system globally. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 11, 2020

MicroStrategy, a U.S. business intelligence company, released a K8 form informing the SEC and the public that the company may increase its Bitcoin holdings beyond the initial $250 million investment in August.

Since the filing, the company has invested another $175 million in BTC.

MicroStrategy’s new policy enables them to regularly transform parts of their passive cash assets into Bitcoin, without any further notice to the SEC.

Twenty-four hours after the news went public, Michael Sayler, the firm’s founder, announced that MicroStrategy acquired 16,796 additional Bitcoin, bringing the total holdings up to 38,250 BTC, or $425 million.

On September 14, 2020, MicroStrategy completed its acquisition of 16,796 additional bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $175 million.

The cryptocurrency is trading at $10,340 at press time.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, started the week around $340 and moved up throughout it until it hit a $380 high. Since then its price dropped to $360 in a correction felt across the entire crypto market.

A total of $711.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency derivatives products were traded in August, as volumes went up 53.6 per cent when compared to July. The figure represents a new all-time high for monthly derivatives trading volumes.According to CryptoCompare’s August 2020 Exchange Review, spot volumes also increased by 49.6 per cent last month to $944.9 billion, which means derivatives represented just over 40 per cent of the market share.

The top cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms were Huobi, OKEx, Binance, and BitMEX. All these platforms saw their derivatives volumes climb up significantly, with Binance seeing the biggest rise of 74 per cent. These four cryptocurrency exchanges, the report notes, represented over 90 per cent of the derivatives volume throughout the month.

Deribit’s bitcoin options volumes remained steady compared to July, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s options contracts saw a volume increase of 8.4 per cent in August. CME’s bitcoin futures contracts saw a 36.3 per cent rise.

The same report notes that according to CryptoCompare’s Exchange Benchmark, Top-Tier exchanges – those graded AA-BB – traded a total of $529 billion in said month, representing 64 per cent of the space’s total spot volume.

While trading volumes in the cryptocurrency space have been increasing, support for cryptocurrency adoption has also seemingly been growing. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey has, in an interview with Reuters, recently said he believes bitcoin is the “best manifestation” of a native currency for the internet:

During the interview, Dorsey noted that the internet is “built by everyone, and anyone can really change the course of it.” Bitcoin, he said, was built on the internet and has the “same patterns” as anyone can contribute to the development of the cryptocurrency.

The CEO did mention nonetheless that there are a few barriers holding back bitcoin’s adoption. These include transaction times and efficiency. To him, BTC needs to be built in a way “that it is as intuitive, it’s as fast, and is as efficient as what exists today.”

Square, the payment company Dorsey created, has invited other crypto firms to join its Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit that wants to stop firms from locking up useful crypto technologies using patents. The goal of COPA is to see members make their patents freely available to all other members in a shared library.

Bitcoin’s acceptance as a payment method has also been growing. French-based users of the Just Eat food delivery service, which works in a way similar to Uber Eats, can now use BTC to pay for food delivered to their home. Bitcoin was added as a payment method after Takeaway.com acquired the service.

Hackers Fail to Crack Bitcoin Wallet Containing $700 million

Cryptocurrency exchanges and users are known to be targeted by hackers, as the pseudonymous nature of cryptoassets makes it easier for criminal purposes. While common attack methods include social engineering and phishing attacks to compromise users and exchanges, cracking a wallet that’s freely available isn’t as easy.

Over the last two years, hackers have been trying to access the seventh-largest bitcoin wallet, with 69,730 BTC ($723 million) in it. The CTO of the cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, Alon Gal, has revealed hackers have been passing around the wallet in an attempt to crack its password.

Get this – there is a Bitcoin wallet with 69,000 Bitcoins ($693,207,618) that is being passed around between hackers/crackers for the past 2 years for the purpose of cracking the password, no success so far.

Various websites are selling the wallet.dat file for 0.08929505 BTC – over $1,000 – to hackers who want to try and crack it. The file is protected by a password. It’s worth noting that Gal pointed out it’s possible to forge wallets, meaning the wallet.dat file could be for an empty wallet, and not for the seventh-largest wallet containing over $700 million of BTC.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Money transmitters like Western Union, PayPal, and cryptocurrency firms will be able to more easily expand across the United States, after 48 state regulators agreed to a single set of supervisory rules that should reduce their compliance costs.

The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) will on Tuesday unveil the new regulatory regime for money services businesses, which will undergo a single exam by a joint group of state regulators that oversee licensing, instead of dozens of individual state exams.

The new streamlined regime applies to 78 large payment and cryptocurrency firms, which combined move over $1 trillion annually. It aims to make it easier for companies to operate across multiple states, the CSBS told Reuters.

State regulators have been working together in recent years to address company complaints that the state-by-state supervisory system is redundant and overly burdensome. Crypto-currency and fintech firms, which typically have to be licensed state by state have been particularly vocal about the problem.

Under the new arrangement, a group of examiners from a handful of states will jointly supervise a business, instead of each individual state.

John Ryan, CSBS’s president and CEO, said the new approach will be just as robust, but more efficient. States will be able to share information from the exams, and each state will reserve the right to launch independent examinations if they want.

“The states aren’t giving up authority. They’re realizing efficiencies by sharing information,” he said in an interview.

Rosemary Gallagher, associate counsel for Western Union, which participated in a pilot program last year, said the company previously faced dozens of individual state exams and that they expected that repetition to be reduced.

She added that the new regime would reduce the burden for each individual state too, allowing them to field their “highest quality examiners.”",2020-09-15 21:21:03+00:00,https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/15/sec-cryptocurrency-statement/,"I learnt about the new ‘Statement On Digital Assets And Their Classification And Treatment’ issued by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday from a friend who wanted to understand what the ‘Statement’ means for his business in the Nigerian cryptocurrency space.

On the face of it, the Statement gives us an insight into SEC’s approach towards regulating the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency space. While the Statement clearly establishes SEC’s intention to introduce regulation in the near future, it leaves some other issues needing clarification.

This piece is my attempt at thinking through the Statement and what it might mean for the future of the Nigerian cryptocurrency regulation framework.

First, we need regulation

We are now past the point where we ask if Nigeria’s cryptocurrency space needs regulation; the issue at this point is how to do it. The need to protect consumers and unsophisticated investors in emerging industries is a key driver for creating framework regulations.

Advertisement

As with any emerging industry, especially in finance, the predictable emergence of scams and fraudulent behaviour requires clear regulation to protect investors and ensure safety within markets.

From the stakeholder perspective, investors need clarity on existing legal frameworks before they inject their money. We are already witnessing the exit of Nigerian crypto businesses to more structured jurisdictions due to the absence of existing frameworks. So, surely, the SEC Statement sends a good signal.

The Statement, however, highlights some of the problems regulators all over the world face with regulating crypto-assets.

The classification problem: Is it a bird or a plane?

Crypto-assets present a unique problem for regulators because they exist as hybrids between assets, currencies, securities, and commodities. For context, The United States Treasury categorises bitcoin as a decentralised virtual currency, while its Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Internal Revenue Service classify it as a commodity and an asset, respectively. In these instances, regulators seek to classify crypto-assets in ways that bring them within their regulatory jurisdictions.

The classification of crypto-assets also differs across countries. The South African Revenue Service classifies bitcoin as an intangible asset. The German Federal Bank recommends using the term “crypto token”. The People’s Bank of China has stated that bitcoin “is fundamentally not a currency but an investment target.” For regulators, the classification problem is a special problem because of the jurisdiction issue.

The issue of jurisdiction

Regulators must operate within the scope of the jurisdiction granted to them under the law. To be able to regulate the crypto-assets space, a regulator must show that the space falls within its jurisdiction. The SEC, in the Statement, relies on Section 13 of the Investment and Securities Act, 2007 which grants it powers to regulate investments and securities business in Nigeria. What this means is that the SEC lacks jurisdiction to regulate cryptocurrencies as currencies, mere assets, or mere commodities.

To be clear, the Statement says, “the SEC will regulate crypto-token or crypto-coin investments when the character of the investments qualifies as securities transactions.”

Covering the Field?

“The position of the Commission is that virtual crypto assets are securities, unless proven otherwise. Thus, the burden of proving that the crypto assets proposed to be offered are not securities and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the SEC, is placed on the issuer or sponsor of the said assets.”

What the SEC appears to say with this declaration is ‘we will assume jurisdiction over every virtual crypto-asset until the issuer of the crypto-asset shows us otherwise by showing us that the crypto-asset is not a security’. If this is the case, it makes sense that the regulator seeks to cover every possible field especially as new forms of crypto-assets continue to emerge.

However, the lack of specificity puts all crypto-related businesses in a difficult situation as they automatically fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction until the SEC states otherwise. The burden this places on businesses becomes more obvious when we consider that the CBN is expected to issue its own crypto regulations soon. From an absence of regulation a few days ago, businesses might now be answerable to two regulators with differing compliance frameworks.

An alternative and more reasonable interpretation of the SEC’s declaration is that it applies only to crypto-assets and investment instruments issued specifically by companies to raise funds for a project or business. We are seeing the re-emergence of Initial Coin Offerings by startup founders to fund their projects.

We are also seeing an emergence of online investment schemes issuing crypto-tokens to participants as forms of participation in these schemes. Indeed, by tracking ‘the issuer or sponsor of the said assets’ for explanation as to whether or not the assets qualify as securities, the SEC follows its mandate of regulating issuers of securities within the Nigerian market for the purpose of protecting the investment and securities space. However, this interpretation would mean that businesses offering platforms for exchange of decentralised currencies like bitcoin and ethereum would not fall within SEC’s jurisdiction.

Reasonably, these other crypto trade businesses would fall within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Central Bank of Nigeria since they can neither be classified as ‘issuers’ nor ‘sponsors’ of crypto-assets and they deal with crypto-assets as currencies and means of exchange. If this is the SEC’s intention, greater clarity is needed in its forthcoming regulations.

Who will be regulated?

“Any person, (individual or corporate) whose activities involve any aspect of Blockchain-related and virtual digital asset services, must be registered by the Commission and as such, will be subject to the regulatory guidelines. Such services include, but are not limited to reception, transmission and execution of orders on behalf of other persons, dealers on own account, portfolio management, investment advice, custodian or nominee services.”

This declaration raises the same question earlier discussed. Is the intention really to cover every type of blockchain activity? If this is the intention, the SEC might be stepping out of its jurisdiction. A roadside shop offering bitcoin for cash services could not possibly fall within the SEC’s regulatory remit under the Investment and Securities Act except the SEC intends to classify bitcoin as a security.

If the intention is to cover persons and businesses dealing in any way with crypto-assets which qualify as securities, then the SEC will need to provide more clarity in its forthcoming regulations especially on the types of crypto-assets that qualify as securities.

Clarity at the end?

Towards the end of the Statement, a table classifying virtual digital assets and their treatment by the SEC may provide some relief and clarity for crypto-businesses.

It provides that “Crypto Assets e.g non fiat currencies would be treated as commodities if they are traded on a Recognized Investment Exchange and/or issued as an investment, and is subject to Part E of SEC Rules and Regulations and any other relevant sections and subsequent Rules which will be enacted in future.”

This declaration fully aligns with the remit of the SEC under the law and its likely jurisdictional powers to regulate the cryptocurrency space. It clearly excludes crypto-assets that are neither issued as investments nor traded on a Recognized Investment Exchange from SEC’s regulatory cover. It would be instructive to see how this aligns with the earlier declarations in the Statement and how the SEC clarifies some of these ambiguities in its forthcoming regulations.

Conclusion

The Statement is not a regulation. It is similar to earlier statements issued by the SEC advising Nigerians to be careful with cryptocurrencies. It serves as a signal to the market as we expect draft regulations to be published soon. Hopefully, we will see more clarity in the forthcoming regulations especially on the types of crypto-assets to be covered by SEC regulation and the players like ‘issuers’ and ‘sponsors’ who it seeks to pursue. zp-pdl.com http://www.otc-certified-store.com/anticonvulsants-medicine-usa.html https://zp-pdl.com http://www.otc-certified-store.com/muscle-relaxants-medicine-usa.html https://zp-pdl.com/online-payday-loans-cash-advances.php займ владимирвзять займ в мфозайм на карту золотая корона

Comments",2020-09-15 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/japan-cryptocurrency-exchange-zaif-fisco-binance-laundering-hack,"A Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that suffered from a $60 million hack in 2018 is suing Binance for “aiding and abetting” the laundering of some of the stolen funds.

According to a complaint filed by Fisco in the Northern California District Court on Sept. 14, the Japanese exchange alleged that soon after it lost nearly 6,000 bitcoin in the 2018 hack, the thieves sent 1,451 bitcoin to an address belonging to Binance, which was worth $9.4 million at the time.

Fisco – called Zaif at the time of the hack – added that the thieves subsequently laundered the funds on the world’s largest exchange platform, due to its allegedly lax know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols that “do not measure up to industry standards.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The thieves are claimed to have taken advantage of Binance’s policy that allowed new users to open accounts and transact on the platform in amounts fewer than two bitcoins without needing to provide any meaningful identifying information.

“The thieves broke the stolen bitcoin into seven thousands of separate transactions and accounts, all valued below the 2-bitcoin threshold. In this way, the thieves converted the stolen bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies and transmitted the value from the Binance platform,” the plaintiff said.

Fisco alleged that since Binance was notified and had “actual knowledge” the stolen funds were sent to its platform, it “either intentionally or negligently failed to interrupt the money laundering process when it could have done so.”

As such, Fisco is demanding Binance to pay for its loss of the laundered funds in addition to other punitive damages.

Zaif was sold by its then-parent entity Tech Bureau to Fisco shortly after the incident, which compensated users’ who had lost funds in the hack.

About $41 million worth of crypto assets from the hack belonged to Zaif customers including those based within the U.S. and California, according to the court filing.

Biannce has not yet responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

The case has the potential to draw further attention to cryptocurrency exchanges’ KYC and AML procedures, as the Financial Action Task Force is working towards bringing global regulators in line with its 2019 anti-money laundering guidance on “virtual asset service providers,” known as the Travel Rule.

California claims

Fisco also argued the case should be brought to trial in the California court not only because there were victims who were based in the region, but also “critical components” of Binance’s business are located in the U.S. state.

For example, Fisco said Binance uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host its servers and has the ability to select whichever AWS data center it chooses for its operations.

The argument comes after repeated statements made by Binance that it has no traditional physical headquarters anywhere in the world.

“Upon information and belief, a significant portion if not all of the AWS servers Binance relies on for its operations are located in the State of California. Upon information and belief, the AWS Region and AWS Availability Zones housing Binance’s digital data used to run its technical platform are located in California,” Fisco said.

In addition to Binance having hired half a dozen employees in California, Fisco argued that a significant portion of Binance’s cryptocurrency reserves is also stored in offline hardware facilities located in the San Francisco Bay Area that are controlled and managed by custodians headquartered in the region.

“For example, on July 7, 2020, Binance acquired cryptocurrency startup Swipe. Binance admits that Swipe uses Coinbase and Bitgo, both of which are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, to custody the cryptocurrency used in Swipe’s business,” the plaintiff said.

Fisco is seeking a jury trial over its allegations.",2020-09-15 07:55:05+00:00,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/government-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-cryptocurrency-trading-report-11600172774292.html,"India plans to introduce a new law banning trade in cryptocurrencies, placing it out of step with other Asian economies which have chosen to regulate the fledgling market.

The bill is expected to be discussed shortly by the federal cabinet before it is sent to parliament, according to people familiar with the development who asked not to be identified, citing rules on speaking with the media.

The federal government will encourage blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, but is not keen on cryptocurrency trading, according to two people. India’s finance ministry spokesman didn’t respond to call and a message seeking comments.

The Indian central bank had in 2018 banned crypto transactions after a string of frauds in the months following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden decision to ban 80% of the nation’s currency. Cryptocurrency exchanges responded with a lawsuit in the Supreme Court in September and won respite in March 2020.

The win in court prompted an almost 450% surge in trading in just two months since March, according to TechSci Research, reviving concerns as more Indians risk savings amid job losses and an economic slowdown worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Bitcoin marketplace Paxful reported 883% growth between January to May 2020 from around $2.2 million to $22.1 million. WazirX, a Mumbai based crypto exchanger grew 400% in March 2020 and 270% in April 2020 on month-on-month basis, according to TechSci.

Regulating trades

India’s decision will be crucial as more Asian nation countries weigh pros and cons of virtual currencies. Rival China, which banned initial coin offerings and virtual currencies in 2017, recently allowed Bitcoin trading as virtual property, not as fiat money. It is also planning its own central bank digital currency. Both Singapore and South Korea regulate crypto trades.

India’s federal government think tank, Niti Aayog, is exploring possible uses of blockchains -- structures that publicly store transactional records or blocks in several networked databases -- to manage land records, pharmaceutical drugs supply chain or records of educational certificates. And while it is planning a virtual currency, the government is averse to the idea of the cryptocurrency trades.

A renewed trading ban could affect more than 1.7 million Indians trading in digital assets and a rising number of companies setting up platforms for the trade, data shows.

It will also affect companies like Singapore-based CoinSwitch, which added 200,000 users after starting India operations in June and was reporting volumes of about $200-300 million, according to chief executive officer Ashish Singhal. About half the users of the Sequoia-backed company’s local arm CoinSwitch Kuber, platform, which allows virtual currency purchases in Indian rupees, are less than 25-years old.

Singal said state-owned banks are reluctant to work with companies given lack of regulation clarity. And because there’s no legal recourse, there is the risk of attracting “fly-by-night, negative players trying to cheat"" investors, he said.

Instead of a ban, India needs a regulatory framework to protect uninformed retail consumers “to ensure adequate oversight of the government and the RBI over cryptocurrency businesses,"" said Sanjay Khan, Partner, Khaitan & Co, a New Delhi-based lawyer who advises firms. “India can actually benefit from such a regulation to attract cryptocurrency investors and businesses.""

On Sept. 8, BTCPay Server founder Nicolas Dorier and Suredbits founder Chris Stewart entered the bet on the 2020 U.S. presidential election outcome using a discrete log contract (DSL), a form of smart contract that became feasible on Bitcoin just this year, thanks to independent Bitcoin developer Lloyd Fournier’s technical advancements in the realm of so-called “scriptless-scripts” on Bitcoin’s blockchain.

As for who took which side of the bet, Dorier and Stewart didn’t say. Even after Election Day when the votes are tallied we still won’t know who won the bet. And that’s very much the point.

Otherwise, the contracts wouldn’t be discrete.

What are discrete log contracts?

Described by developer Gert-Jaap Glasbergen as “invisible smart contracts,” discrete log contracts are structured to look like standard multi-signature transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain. If someone were searching for the transaction on the ledger, they would have no way of knowing it’s a smart contract or, in Dorier and Stewart’s case, the details of the bet.

These smart contracts have theoretically been feasible since Bitcoin’s inception, but groundbreaking work with ECDSA adapter signatures (a cryptographic signature scheme that enables “scriptless scripts” to execute smart contracts without relying on Bitcoin’s scripting language) in the past year has brought them from theory to application.

“Technically DLCs could have been done since the original release, but a lot of the building blocks weren’t known back then. For instance, for DLCs we use ECDSA adapter signatures, whose application for this use case wasn’t discovered until this year [by Lloyd Fournier],” Suredbits developer Ben Carman told CoinDesk.

Suredbits is one of the primary actors pioneering DLC development along with Crypto Garage, Atomic Loans, Square Crypto-funded independent developer Loyd Fornier, and Chaincode Labs developer Antoine Riard.

The structure of a DLC transaction is pretty straightforward. Building on the bet between Dorier and Stewart, two parties send funds to a multi-signature address. In order to settle the transaction, an oracle would sign the contract with a signature that corresponds to the hash of the winning outcome (in this case, either Republican_Win or Democrat_Win).

The person with the hash that corresponds with the oracle’s signature can then withdraw the funds from the contract.

In Carman’s words, “It’s fancy cryptography to show that your contract is based on the oracle signature and you can only spend the funds if you have that valid oracle signature.”

DLC development is young but promising

Carman said DLCs are “still super early,” so much so that the teams working on them are still creating libraries for coding specifications.

He added that DLCs could even find a home on the Lightning Network, but this would take some advancements considering that current implementations are not hard coded to accommodate ECDSA adapter signatures.

Accommodating ECDSA on Lightning would require the addition of point-time-lock-contracts (PTLCs), an in-the-works upgraded version of the hash-time-lock-contracts that currently operate on Lightning.

Schnorr signatures would be an ideal base for implementing PTLCs. The long-awaited Schnorr/Taproot upgrade is essential still for DLCs in general, Carman said. Even though DLCs can be executed today, more advanced use cases will be much easier to implement if Bitcoin’s codebase receives a boost from the Schnorr/Taproot softfork.

DLC use cases

“Betting will be the primary use-case in the beginning – so, elections, sports and what-have-you,” Carman told CoinDesk. “Once it’s more established and we have a market for defining counterparties for trades, there will be use-cases for hedging or synthetic assets.”

The hedging use case is outlined by Glasbergen in his “Invisible smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain” blog post. The “forward contracts” would entail two parties entering a DLC, with one party agreeing to purchase a certain amount of bitcoin (BTC) for an agreed-upon price, and the other party providing the liquidity for this purchase.

When the time comes for the contract to settle, the contract pays the buyer the amount of bitcoin per the price specified at the time the contract was formed, not per the current exchange rate. In essence, these forward contracts are a way to long or short bitcoin.",2020-09-15 19:57:08+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/eastern-europe-dark-market,"Disclosure

A cryptocurrency is an encrypted decentralized digital currency that can be transferred from one individual to another.

Since the launch of Bitcoin, many players have joined the market. Aside from Bitcoin, the other top players are Ethereum(ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP).

With many cryptocurrencies in the market, it is difficult for traders to choose which to trade.

The problem of decision is made harder by new market players touting their currencies as the next Bitcoin. Below are tips to follow to choose which cryptocurrency to trade.

Choose Your Level of Risk

With more than 2300 cryptocurrencies in the market, Bitcoin is the most volatile and stable. Investing in BTC is seen as a safe bet because it is the oldest in the market and is priced below its $20,000 all-time high.

The other cryptocurrencies are referred to as “altcoins” with ETH, LTC, and XRP being established and stable cryptos.

It is advisable to spread your risk by diversifying your investment. To strengthen your investment portfolio, you may have to invest in one or more stable digital currencies.

Stable currencies are designed to mimic flat currency. These keep price fluctuations minimum and are a good way to put your money into a cryptocurrency exchange.

Conduct Independent Research

While listening to a company’s representatives and ready opinions is important, nothing gives you better judgment than conducting independent research. Before deciding to trade BTC/USD vs ETH/USD or any other cryptocurrency, look at their historical charts.

Areas to pay attention to should be circulation and market cap. While the price is important, it is not something to get stuck on.

Look for stability and dig up a cryptocurrency’s full history. A digital currency could still be in its growth stage and might show a record of continuous growth.

On the other hand, it might have a history of big peaks and large corrections. Avoid currencies that have suffered large drops in their market cap. This is an indication of dying demand.

Find out as much as you can about the company offering the cryptocurrency, and the problems it intends to solve.

Seek offerings that have innovative technology and strong backing of the idea. Research on the leadership of the company, their technical team and the track record of the CEO.

Be on the Lookout for Possible ICO Offerings

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are the go-to method for digital currency companies looking to come up with working capital and roll out new cryptocurrencies.

Similar to the stock market, this involves betting on the company that can deliver the product and gives you returns on your investment.

When choosing which cryptocurrency to invest in, ICOs present you with a good opportunity. In essence, you have no historical charts to guide you. So you have to rely on your understanding of the offering, what makes it stand out in the market, and the team behind the offering.

Since you are starting from the ground up, investing in a good ICO will help you achieve big gains. To help you be in a position to spot the next profitable ICO, look into past successful offerings and keep track of recent trends in the industry.

Look into Unknown Crypto Exchanges

If you missed out on an ICO, you have a chance to buy the currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Most well known and established exchanges limit the currencies they trade. You are likely to find a better investment on lesser-known platforms.

To protect your investment, conduct independent research on the crypto exchange and the people running it.

Be Aware and Vigilant

Choosing which cryptocurrencies and altcoins to trade can be a daunting task. Sticking to the facts and not making emotional decisions will help you select the investment that will be right for you.

Once you have selected the coin you want to invest in, remain vigilant and monitor your portfolio closely. Be on the lookout for all news regarding your investment and continue conducting the same independent research as you did before investing.

Altcoins might not experience the same rapid growth as Bitcoin since some are in the growth phase. However, choosing the right cryptocurrency to invest in can lead to lucrative returns.

",2020-09-16 00:00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/77804/kraken-crypto-bank-launch-wyoming,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is launching a bank under a new regulatory framework in Wyoming, a move that will expand its product suite, the firm said in an announcement Wednesday.

Headquartered in Wyoming, Kraken Financial will be regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking under a so-called Special Purpose Depository Institution. The new structure was purpose-built for cryptocurrency companies and will allow Kraken to offer certain banking functions to clients and effectively serve as the exchange operator's primary banking relationship. Up until this point, Kraken has relied on third-party providers for wire transfers and other services that enable it to engage with the broader financial system.

Crypto firms have a history of challenging and precarious banking relationships. Most traditional banks have refused to offer services to such firms, while some offshore exchanges like Bitfinex have had trouble maintaining relationships with banking partners. To be sure, there are some small community banks aimed at the crypto market—such as Signature and Silvergate—but they have had issues with outbound wire transfers in the past. Still, big banks are moving into the market with JPMorgan recently taking on exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as banking clients.

""For Kraken, this represents a better banking infrastructure,"" Dave Kinitsky, CEO of Kraken Financial, said in a phone interview with The Block. ""This will require less reliance on third-party providers and offers more certainty from a regulatory perspective and will allow us to launch new products for new customer segments.""

""Having an affiliate company allows us to more closely integrate this into our product experience,"" he said. For end clients, that could result in quicker transfers between their external accounts and their Kraken account, according to Kinitsky.

Clients will also be able to bank directly with Kraken Financial just as they would with their existing bank. To start, the firm will offer clients the ability to deposit USD and digital assets, which ""will be seamlessly integrated into the existing exchange services, providing clients better funding infrastructure, a better experience and enhanced regulatory clarity,"" as per a press release.

""There's going to be a phased approach to this,"" said Kinitsky. ""In the first phase we expect to be the bank of choice for our clients and in phase two or three we will begin offering new services and products.""

For instance, Kinitsky said the firm could launch a crypto debit card, a yield account product, or an IRA product. Its banking status could also allow it to offer services in stock, derivatives or commodities trading, he added.

""Finally, we expect to be able to offer additional retail, wealth management and treasury services (and potentially other asset classes such as securities), so stay tuned!"" a press release said.

To be sure, Kraken isn't alone in its aspiration to be a crypto bank. Elsewhere, BlockFi is working on building out a suite of wealth-management products for crypto, including an upcoming credit card. Meanwhile, Abra—which offers an interest-bearing account for crypto—also has its own ambitions to ""re-define"" the traditional banking stack, as noted by CEO Bill Barhydt in a recent phone conversation.

As for Kraken, it has to dot a few i's before it can officially launch its new bank. The firm is in the process of lining correspondent banking partners and opening an account with the Federal Reserve. It's also not clear if every state will respect the status of Kraken's new bank charter.

""We are on route and we expect to get the charter approval on Wednesday and then we lock-up those relationships and move to launch,"" said Kinitsky. ""We expect reciprocity from other states and have talked with a number of them and expect the lion share to have reciprocity as they do for other out of state-chartered banking institutions.""

New York, which Kraken has spared with in the past, could be one state that will require additional steps for reciprocity, Kinitsky said.

""There would be a couple things we'd have to do for New York,"" he said. ""For instance, would have to have a physical bank branch and reconcile some things with the BitLicense.""

The Block's news director Frank Chaparro spoke with Kraken chief legal officer Marco Santori about the news. The interview audio can be found below:",,https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-regulators-approve-states-first-crypto-bank/article_450bd96b-d301-53e4-8cb3-ba219e53368d.html,"But it also establishes Wyoming as a leader in the nation’s cryptocurrency markets and lays the groundwork for the state to become a key player in international markets. According to a blog post by Kraken on Wednesday, the company hopes to roll out its banking services globally, though it will initially limit cryptobanking to U.S. consumers exclusively.

“I’m excited that this day has finally arrived,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement. “I’m proud that Wyoming is leading the way in digital assets and built the framework for this historic announcement to occur. This puts into practice what Wyoming saw as an opportunity to meet the challenges of a digital economy and allow businesses a way to hold digital assets safely.”

While it’s the state’s first special purpose depository institution, or SPDI, Kraken will not be its last. WyoFinancial, a venture backed by former Austin, Texas, resident Jeremy Drzal, is looking to make its own inroads into the state, while Avanti Financial — a company spearheaded by former Wall Streeter and Cheyenne crypto advocate Caitlin Long — is in the process of finalizing its application and is expected to have a hearing of its own in the near future.

Despite much anticipation, the Indian cryptocurrency bill is not included in the list of bills to be introduced in the current session of parliament. Meanwhile, a new report of India’s government planning to ban cryptocurrency trading has emerged.

Indian Government’s Cryptocurrency Plan

The Indian government has been deliberating on how it will treat cryptocurrencies in the country after a draft crypto bill was submitted by an interministerial committee headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg last year.

The government originally said that it planned to introduce this bill in the Winter session of parliament last year. When that did not happen, there were reports suggesting that the crypto bill could be introduced in the Monsoon session, which started Monday and will continue through Oct. 1.

Tanvi Ratna, CEO of blockchain policy and regulatory advisory firm Policy 4.0, explained on Twitter Sunday that the Monsoon session of parliament was disrupted due to the covid-19 pandemic, adding:

Cryptocurrency ban legislation does not appear in the list of 45+ bills on the agenda for the 18-day session. This is big news, though this could change & there are other routes for govt.

The Indian government has not made any announcement regarding its plans for cryptocurrency, which has led to rumors and speculation. Several reports indicate that the government is planning to ban cryptocurrencies as outlined in the draft bill submitted by the Garg committee.

The latest crypto ban news was published by Bloomberg on Tuesday. The publication claims that India is planning “to introduce law to ban cryptocurrency trading.” Citing “people familiar with the development who asked not to be identified, citing rules on speaking with the media,” the publication wrote:

The bill is expected to be discussed shortly by the federal cabinet before it is sent to parliament.

“The federal government will encourage blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, but is not keen on cryptocurrency trading, according to two people,” the news outlet added.

Since this is not the first time the Indian crypto community has had to deal with ban rumors, many people on Twitter were quick to point out that the sources of the news are anonymous, and previous ban rumors never materialized.

Blockchain lawyer Varun Sethi commented: “Words like ‘federal cabinet’ suggest it’s inspired from some western country. In India, we generally use ‘central government.’ Also, no sources or quotes raise doubts.”

Furthermore, Crypto Kanoon co-founder Mohammed Danish previously explained that if the Indian government decides to pass a law to ban cryptocurrency in some ways, “this law can be challenged by crypto business, traders, or enthusiasts based on various rights available to them under the Constitution.”

Despite multiple ban reports, the cryptocurrency community in India firmly believes that the government will not impose a full ban on cryptocurrencies since much has happened since the Garg committee’s bill was drafted.

Earlier this month, Begin India Think Tank founder Deepak Kapoor explained that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could have the same legal status as stocks. In July, Garg himself said that “Crypto assets as commodities should be allowed,” even though he stood by his recommendation that “cryptocurrencies should be outlawed.” He has since retired from government service.

Bitcoin continues to greatly outperforming the market

This year Bitcoin vastly outperformed stocks and traditional asset classes. As of September 14, Bitcoin is up 43% this year while the S&P is only up 4% and the Dow is down 3%. Other popular cryptos have risen much higher including Ethereum, up 167%, and Chainlink, up 522% (Source: TradingView).

Bitcoin's price increase has largely been driven by increased trading activity and its critical ""halving"" event earlier this year where its inflation rate was automatically cut in half, thus increasing its scarcity to that similar of gold. Ethereum and many of the alternative cryptos are seeing dramatically higher usage of their networks due to increased demand and a new decentralized finance trend, known as ""DeFi."" This is where users can quickly borrow and lend digital money for more favorable rates by bypassing traditional banks.

Major prominent investors are now recommending crypto and gold

A number of prominent investors are now recommending crypto and gold as a hedge against economic concerns. This includes excessive inflation, central bank debt and increased money supply, as results of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

These crypto and gold supporters include Former Prudential CEO, George Ball, who recently advised his clients to invest in Bitcoin and famed billionaire and hedge-fund investor Paul Tutor Jones wrote a thorough letter to his clients recommending them to buy Bitcoin ""as a hedge against inflation."" Warren Buffet has also been selling his stake in traditional big banks and buying gold-focused companies with his recent investment of $563 million in GOLD, a gold mining company, as part of a portfolio shift foreshadowing high inflation in the coming years.

",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/what-does-nigerias-proposed-crypto-regulation-mean-for-crypto-in-africa/,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria recently announced that it will be regulating the trade of digital currencies in the country. “Issuers or sponsors of virtual digital assets shall be guided by the commission’s regulation,” the regulator said in a statement.

The move is intended to protect investors’ best interests and to promote transparency within the space: “the general objective of regulation is not to hinder technology or stifle innovation, but to create standards that encourage ethical practices,” the regulator said.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

Regulations Could Bring More Legitimacy–and More Investors–to Crypto in Nigeria

While there are not too many specifics about what the regulation will look like, the agency said that the regulations will apply “when the character of the investments qualifies as securities transactions.” In other words, if the digital assets can be classified as securities, they will fall under the jurisdiction of the Nigerian SEC.

And even though the regulation has not hit the books yet, the fact that the Nigerian SEC is making moves toward regulating cryptocurrencies seems to represent a shift in the country’s attitude toward cryptocurrencies. After all, the Central Bank of Nigeria did declare in 2018 that crypto-currencies including Bitcoin, Ripple, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Onecoin, were not regarded as money.

A legal classification as a ‘security’ certainly will not make cryptocurrency into ‘money’ in the eyes of the law, either. However, the fact that the Nigerian SEC is recognizing that cryptocurrencies are, indeed, securities (and that as such, they need to be regulated) is a step forward.

This is because as more regulations have been applied to the cryptocurrency industry in other countries, more investors, particularly those of the institutional stripe, have tended to follow. It seems that investors may feel safer to enter the crypto space when regulators are present to abate the effects of fraud and other mishaps.

And indeed, cryptocurrency regulations can have a stabilizing effect on the space. Ayodeji Ebo, managing director at Afrinvest securities in Lagos, told Bloomberg that “crypto transactions are already happening and the earlier it is regulated, the less havoc on the economy,” and that the emergence of crypto assets and relevant regulations “is another way to provide alternative assets to investors.”

“Nigeria is a crypto hotspot”

Even without the presence of regulations, it seems that investors in Nigeria have already been taking a dive into the world of cryptocurrencies.

Fernando Martinho, chief executive of fintech crowdfunding service, Nimbus Platform, told Finance Magnates that “Nigeria is a crypto-hotspot.”

“it is the biggest crypto market in Africa, especially regarding consumer adoption,” he said.

This is evidenced by several metrics: “according to Google Trends, Nigeria is ranked first worldwide in Google searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin’, ‘Ethereum’,” Martinho told Finance Magnates.

Martinho also said that “the country is also one of the biggest sources of BTC trading volume in Africa.”

Citing a recent report from Chainalaysis, he explained that “Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya lead the continent in monthly crypto transfers.”

The high amount of interest in cryptocurrencies seems to be the largest driver in the Nigerian SEC: “such big interests from the residents of Nigeria push regulators to adopt appropriate legislation,” Martinho commented.

More Regulations Tend to Bring in More Institutional Investors

While most of the interest in cryptocurrencies in Nigeria seems to be driven by retail investors, Martinho also stated that “institutional adoption will likely follow once there are more comprehensive regulations” in place.

A similar phenomenon has been observed in other countries that have adopted higher levels of regulation for the cryptocurrency industry.

Indeed, Ciara Sun, head of global markets at Huobi Group, said at a CoinTelegraph event in July that “larger institutions have higher compliance requirements, but regulatory agencies have not provided enough guidance on digital assets in the past.”

“This unclear regulatory landscape has made it riskier for larger institutions,” she said.

However, even without the immediate entrance of institutional investors into the Nigerian cryptocurrency industry, there is still huge potential for growth of the crypto industry.

Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Could Fill a Financial Services Gap in Nigeria and Beyond

Why is this?

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

For one thing, a lack of many of the traditional financial services that are often taken for granted in more developed countries are lacking in Nigeria.

This is because financial regulators in a number of African countries, including Nigeria, have imposed significant restrictions on how citizens can spend their money.

Ray Youssef, chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Paxful explained this phenomenon in an interview with Finance Magnates earlier this year: “[African people] have a lot of money there. They just can’t use it,” he said.

This is because “the banking system there is disconnected from the rest of the world,” Ray explained; the problem even exists between countries within the African continent: “If you’re in western Africa and you want to send money out of the country, it’s nearly impossible. You have to go to three or four or five hops. You have to use your friends and family networks.”

Therefore, “there is a real, true need for Bitcoin [in Africa],” Youssef said, “not on a speculative basis, but on a real utility basis.”

Additionally, Nigerian financial news outlet Nairametrics reported in August that some Nigerian banks had reduced their customers’ dollar-spending limits to as low as $100, causing major problems for some citizens: “Nigerians rely on their debit cards to pay for online transactions that are billed in US dollars,” the report said.

This reduction in dollar spending limits, which were already quite low, has forced Nigerians to seek dollars elsewhere. In 2015, before Bitcoin truly ‘took off’ in Nigeria and elsewhere in the world, Quartz reported that “if you can’t access foreign currency through official channels, you are left with no choice but to use the black market at much higher rates.”

The ‘Leapfrog’ Effect

Therefore, it seems quite likely that part of Bitcoin’s apparent popularity in Nigeria has to do with the fact that it can be used to pay for some products that can be sold online; it can also be used to more easily access foreign currencies, including USD. In other words, the popularity of Bitcoin in Nigeria is linked to the fact that BTC is being used for practical purposes rather than speculative trading and investing.

As such, the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, and the entrance of institutions that could follow, could make cryptocurrency adoption in the country truly explosive.

This adoption could continue to extend beyond Nigeria and into some of the more rural areas of the African continent. This is because of a phenomenon known as the ‘leapfrog effect.’

What is the leapfrog effect? Before the era of mobile phones, constructing the necessary infrastructure to create a continent-wide landline phone network in Africa was extremely inefficient in terms of time and expenses; it was also very impractical to install telephone poles and cables in rural areas that were not easily accessible by road.

However, the mobile phone industry brought a new era of accessibility to areas of rural Africa. While the landline phone industry struggled from start to end, and never really took off, the mobile phone industry flourished across the continent almost immediately.

Cryptocurrency adoption in African markets, including Nigeria’s, appears to be taking a similar course. The traditional, brick-and-mortar banks that are stalwart pillars of the developed financial world are impractical and inefficient for Africa in the same ways that the landline telephone industry was.

However, the crypto industry, which happens to be highly accessible through mobile phones, seems to be stepping in where traditional financial services failed. Through crypto platforms, millions of people who previously did not have access to financial services can now have them.

Watch This Space

In addition to the financial services gap that cryptocurrency and blockchain can fill across Africa, the fact that the continent’s population is skewed toward younger generations means that Africa is likely to play an increasingly powerful role in the global economy.

“Demographically, African future generations will probably define a significant portion of global trends as a consumer group, driving further adoption for technologies suitable for consumer preferences,” Nimbus Platform’s Fernando Martinho told Finance Magnates. “Cryptocurrency is one such technology.”

Therefore, the introduction of regulation for the cryptocurrency industry in Nigeria could bolster a space that is already poised to boom.

However, it is still too soon to know exactly what the effects of the proposed regulation will be, after all, the details are still unknown.

Indeed, Paxful’s Ray Youssef said that “regarding the proposed rule by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate crypto-token or crypto-coin investments, we are at too early a stage to make any comment. We are analyzing the impact of the current information on the business and also on the community.

“That said, we are open to an opportunity to talk to the regulators and help showcase the various benefits that we’ve learned through the years that cryptocurrencies provide,” he added. “We envision building and helping communities to be financially independent. We see Africa as a leader in fulfilling this vision.”",2020-09-16 09:41:10+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/us-sanctions-two-russians-accused-of-using-fraud-to-steal-millions-in-crypto,"Disclosure

Until recently, digital assets like Bitcoins were the preferred currency of far-right conservatives and die-hard libertarians. The attraction? Cryptocurrencies provide anonymity and the opportunity to snub banks and governments, which have no power over cryptocurrencies because they do not recognize them as legal tender.

The option to contribute to campaigns using Bitcoin has been primarily offered by candidates, like Loomer, who appealed to the Libertarian and far-right demographic.

""Bitcoin promotes financial freedom,"" said Loomer, who said she owns cryptocurrency. ""We are telling the old power structure that we don’t need them anymore. We pave our own destiny financially, intellectually and with speech freedoms.""

But with more fringe candidates stepping into the political arena this election cycle and mainstream, tech-savvy candidates wanting to appear hip to the crypto crowd, donations via the controversial currency are now being accepted by candidates on both sides of the aisle.

Democratic presidential hopefuls Andrew Yang and California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell both accepted Bitcoin contributions before they each dropped out of the race. The campaign of Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, is also accepting cryptocurrency contributions.

""Embracing cryptocurrency signals to those who hold it that your campaign is open-minded, forward-thinking, and up to speed on how consumers are transacting in their daily lives,"" said Perianne Boring, founder and chairman of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. ""It also demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation and its impact on the economy, national security and American leadership.""

Others see cryptocurrency donations as a political stunt and a tool that makes it easier for bad actors to do an end run around campaign finance laws.

“I see Bitcoin often as more of a gimmick,” said Daniel Weiner, the deputy director of election reform at the Brennan Center for Justice. ""The danger with Bitcoin in this realm is that it is essentially designed for anonymity and when we talk about campaign contributions the most important thing is they be disclosed.""

The U.S. Department of the Treasury this month sanctioned three employees of the Russian troll factory known as the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, for their support of the IRA's cryptocurrency accounts. The IRA uses cryptocurrency to sow discord between political parties as part of Moscow’s broader efforts to undermine democratic countries and institutions, according to the department.

What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency is strictly digital and has no physical form — no coins or bills. It also is not regulated by any financial institution or government — meaning transactions are made peer-to-peer, also known as P2P, without going through a third party, like a bank or payment processor such as Paypal.

Users of Bitcoin don’t identify themselves with their real names. Instead, they use Bitcoin addresses, seemingly random strings of numbers and letters, and pseudonyms. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public, digital ledger called a blockchain.

Despite there being a verified record of the transaction in the blockchain, the parties can remain anonymous because they are identified only by their Bitcoin address or pseudonym in the blockchain. No bank, payment processors or government agency has a record of the transaction.

That has made Bitcoin donations popular not only with libertarians who oppose any government interference in their lives but also money launderers, fraudsters and foreign political operatives seeking to covertly dump illegal amounts of cash into campaign coffers.

Recognizing Bitcoin’s potential for fraud in campaigns, and that cryptocurrency donations cannot be easily inspected by the public, the Federal Elections Commission issued an advisory opinion in 2014 with instructions on reporting cryptocurrency donations.

Under the opinion, cryptocurrency donations must be reported as in-kind contributions, like reporting the value of pizzas that a donor purchases for a campaign event. But while the value of the donated pizza will not change, Bitcoin valuations can be wildly volatile.

The value of a single bitcoin in March dropped to $5,800. By Sept. 15, a Bitcoin had a market value of $10,785. So, the fraction of a bitcoin donated today may be below the $2,800 individual contribution limit but above the limit on the day the campaign report is filed.

The FEC addressed that problem by requiring bitcoin contributions be valued on the day they are given. Loomer said she avoids that dilemma by immediately converting all bitcoin donations to cash.

""I think there is a lot of fake news about Bitcoin,"" said Loomer. ""It's disingenuous to say it's any different than accepting cash.""

Bitcoin donations can only be accepted after donors provide their names, addresses, employers and affirm that they own the bitcoins and that they are U.S. citizens. As with all donations, the campaign treasurer is responsible for ensuring transactions are legal and that when the contributions are added to others by the same donor, do not exceed contribution limits.

""There is little difference in the fraud risk of accepting cryptocurrency versus the risk of accepting credit card donations online,"" said Boring. As for fraud concerns, 15 percent of adults in the U.S. own some form of cryptocurrency and at least one-third of U.S. small and medium-sized businesses accept cryptocurrency as payment, Boring said.

Just because a donor uses Bitcoin rather than cash does not mean the donor is trying to hide something, Boring added.

""Many donors prefer to donate cryptocurrency because they want to support the growth of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange and transfer,"" Boring said. ""Cryptocurrency holders are passionate about this emerging technology and they are eager to support and encourage candidates who accept cryptocurrencies.""

Loomer said she got interested in cryptocurrency several years ago. That was about the time she was kicked off Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Uber, Lyft, Medium and other sites and services for her use of hate speech. Loomer also lost the ability to transfer money when third party money processsors, like PayPal, GoFundMe and Venmo also banned her.

""I'm proud I am one of the only candidates in the nation that accepts bitcoin donations,"" said Loomer, the Republican candidate challenging the longtime Democratic incumbent, Lois Frankel.

Loomer said she had not received many bitcoin contributions but she did not respond to a request for information about the number and amount of Bitcoin donations that her campaign has collected.

Campaign finance rules require donors be identified only if their cumulative donations to a candidate exceed $200. Most of Loomer's donations fall into that category. While some candidates identify all donors regardless how small the donation, Loomer has chosen not to do so.

How widespread cryptocurrency donations are in federal and state races across the country is hard to calculate. An investigation by the Center for Public Integrity published in 2018 found 20 candidates running for all levels of office who solicited or had received cryptocurrency donations.

The Center for Public Integrity found federal election records revealed eight candidates who had raised cryptocurrency contributions worth at least $550,000 since 2014.

The cryptocurrency rules that apply to candidates for federal offices do not necessarily apply to candidates in state races. According to the Center for Public Integrity, in 2018, at least eight states and the District of Columbia have created their own limitations or added instructions about cryptocurrency donations in their election manuals. At least seven others state have banned cryptocurrency contributions altogether.

As for Florida, there is no mention of cryptocurrency transactions in campaign manuals or the statute governing campaigns. The state Division of Elections did not respond to repeated requests about whether Florida regulates cryptocurrency use in campaigns.

Whether cryptocurrency transactions in campaigns is a fad or the future of fundraising has yet to be determined. Among the biggest hurdles is the hassle of converting crytocurrency donations to dollars — a process that requires documentation and a payment processing fee or transfer fee, said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, DC.

""TV stations are not going to take bitcoin for ad buys,"" said Libowitz, adding that he has not seen major donors switching to Bitcoin. ""Campaigns like being simple and this is complicated.""

Cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken has received a banking license recognized under federal law to operate as a bank in the U.S. The company has outlined its plans to offer a number of cryptocurrency-focused financial services locally and globally.

Kraken Now a US Bank

Kraken announced Wednesday that it has received a U.S. bank charter. “The state of Wyoming has approved Kraken’s application to form the world’s first Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI), tentatively called Kraken Financial,” the company detailed, elaborating:

Kraken Financial is the first digital asset company in U.S. history to receive a bank charter recognized under federal and state law.

The announcement further states that Kraken Financial “will be the first regulated, U.S. bank to provide comprehensive deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.”

The Wyoming Legislature enacted HB 74 last year, which authorized the chartering of Special Purpose Depository Institutions, which Kraken described as custody banks for digital assets. As a bank, Wyoming law requires Kraken Financial to maintain 100% reserves of its deposits of fiat currency at all times. “If every client were to demand withdrawals of their fiat at the same moment, Kraken Financial would be able to fulfill each withdrawal immediately without regard to how many loans we had outstanding,” the company emphasized.

Kraken Financial will be regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking. It will have a permanent physical presence in Cheyenne with back-office teams and functions. Kraken clarified that it “will operate an online and mobile-first banking model.”

The company explained that its banking operations “will start locally, but will soon operate globally,” noting that the SPDI charter will help expand its reach across the United States, “and will also help the broader Kraken organization to service companies around the world.” Initially, accounts are only available to U.S. residents, but the company says, “We hope to expand globally soon.”

Kraken also outlined the services it plans to offer. In the first year of operations, digital asset custody, demand deposit accounts, wire transfers, and funding services will be available. Within the next few years, more services will be added, such as staking, trust accounts, a complete suite of online and mobile banking services, and debit cards.

One such trader, who asked to go only by Joe, is a math student at a Canadian university. Just by playing with Ethereum software and his own calculations, he managed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2020. This wasn’t his first rodeo, however; he’s been trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for more than a year.

“I’m not a whale in the crypto world but I’m one of the top users of the DeFi protocol I use,” he said. “Before, when DeFi was smaller, there was a lot less competition.”

Since Weird DeFi’s food craze began, Joe said “high yields” are now available to newcomers “without a lot of technical knowledge.”

It’s impossible to say just how many rookie traders raked in unusually high profits during the YAM debacle in August, when an unaudited crypto experiment garnered $465 million in crypto then imploded within 72 hours.

One such anonymous YAM user, who said he rarely trades on exchanges, said he found the YAM trading game fun and relatively easy. He participated in the community vote to “save” YAM, then said he promptly “dumped” his tokens when he realized the software experiment was not sustainable. All things considered, he said he earned $15,000 from participating in YAM, having spent up to $800 on transaction fees.

For both of the above-mentioned DeFi fans, this is a life-changing amount of money. These users often rely on service providers to access the DeFi ecosystem. As such, traders weren’t the only winners of the Yam gambling game. Companies that run the Ethereum network also accrued traffic and transaction fees during the rise of Yam and Sushi, CREAM and now Pickle.

“I access farming and do most one-time things with MetaMask,” Joe said. “The only other [service] I use is the Web3 provider Infura.”

DeFi infrastructure

The DeFi mentality emphasizes open-source access to tools, services with low barriers to entry and distributed teams. Sometimes, this includes low barriers to entry for high-risk games.

According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams in June 2020, most of the Uniswap ecosystem relies on ConsenSys infrastructure services, like Infura. This has also proven to be the common pattern for copycat DeFi projects like SushiSwap. ConsenSys spokesperson James Beck said the Ethereum conglomerate restructured to make infrastructure and wallet services, like Infura and the DeFi-friendly wallet MetaMask, pillars of the company’s “core software business.”

ConsenSys’s head of product for Infura, Michael Godsey, said his team handled the “increased usage” from the food-themed yield farming spike, watching closely to understand “these new usage patterns.” Such DeFi experiments provide inspiration and research data for Ethereum startups, not chagrin.

In reference to the DEX tools people use to access these trading games, Godsey added, “Uniswap and MetaMask are two of our amazing customers and many yield farmers are utilizing their platform to participate in this new activity.”

As for Joe, the Canadian college student, he said he plans to keep stacking tokens because the broader DeFi movement is “sustainable and has been growing at a relatively slow pace for years.”

On the other hand, he said the trends over the past few months were heavily influenced by Compound’s token model. Joe reasoned these DeFi experiments might end in a “big crash” or slow fizzle.",2020-09-17 12:17:42+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/prosecutors-russia-crypto-phishing,"The two Russians who were sanctioned earlier this week by the U.S. Treasury Department on accusations of being crypto thieves allegedly got their millions through market manipulation and phishing.

Prosecutors detailed Danil Potekhin and Dimitrii Karasavidi’s alleged heists, victims and target exchanges in a 30-page forfeiture complaint filed Wednesday against the pair’s previously seized crypto funds.

Karasavidi and Potekhin allegedly “deployed” a series of bogus Poloniex, Gemini and Binance lookalike sites that duped unwitting users into sharing their login credentials, giving the hackers control of wallets.

They then “drained” $20 million worth of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and NEO from victims’ accounts, according to the complaint. Prosecutors said the lion’s share ended up in Karasavidi’s Bitfinex account.

Other funds were frozen by Poloniex and quickly seized by authorities, who filed the lawsuit to take control of 15,602 ETH, 199.8 BTC, $6.1 million in cash and 1,199 NEO, a total worth $14.2 million at press time.

That ETH haul was actually the product of a separate hacker scheme: market manipulation, authorities say.

In late October 2017, hackers pumped $5 million of one victim’s crypto into NEO’s Gas market, skyrocketing the usually sleepy token’s value 13,000% before ordering their personal gas-holding Poloniex accounts to cash out into ETH. The victim “lost virtually all of his $5 million in cryptocurrency,” prosecutors alleged.

Prosecutors also claimed the hackers attempted to cover up the stolen crypto’s origin by “layering” funds – a classic money-laundering technique.

Treasury officials said they used “blockchain tracing analysis” to follow the ETH from the Poloniex manipulation and the Poloniex, Binance and Gemini phishing schemes into Karasavidi’s Bitfinex account.

They further claimed to have identified Potekhin as the owner of multiple misspelled Poloniex domain names linked to the phishing scheme.

Similar tactics were used against Binance and Gemini customers, the regulator said in the lawsuit.

Karasavidi and Potekhin face a mounting lineup of legal troubles. This week, they’ve been added to the Treasury Department’s OFAC blacklist and also face federal wire fraud, hacking and money laundering charges.",2020-09-17 16:11:02+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/a-spain-based-crypto-ponzi-scheme-abruptly-freezes-accounts-of-120000-investors/,"A Spain Based Crypto Ponzi Scheme Abruptly Freezes Accounts of 120,000 Investors

A Spain based crypto Ponzi scheme, Arbicorp abruptly froze accounts of more 120,000 investors on September 12, after the discovery of an error that causes one of its cryptocurrency trading bots to overpay. Arbicorp claims that the error, which went unnoticed for almost a year, led to its trading bot called Community Bot, to pay 28% more in profits than were due.

Interestingly, despite incurring severe financial losses, Arbicorp management said they still went ahead with the overpayments for more than a month. However, Arbicorp assures investors in a statement that “no one will lose” and management even suggests that aggrieved investors that want to take legal action “can proceed.”

Yet in the same statement, the organisation reminds such investors of the terms and conditions of the investment agreement they signed. Part of the terms state:

“The client accepts that the use of our website or service is at own risk and responsibility. The client agrees that the said service is provided as explained depending on availability. The company does not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, safe or error-free; nor does it guarantee the results.”

Consequently, Arbicorp warns investors that choose the legal route that “we will hold your payments until the judicial resolution” has been made.

Meanwhile, despite suffering this setback, Arbicorp management appears keen on getting some of the affected clients to continue investing with the company. The management reminds investors:

We remind everyone that Arbistar 2.0 still has 4 bots of Forex, 1 commodities bot, shortly one of crypto trading and the Personal Bot Pro of Cryptocurrency Arbitrage THAT ONLY KNOWS TO WIN and that in a few weeks it will enter phase 2 to 5,000 euros per year.

Immediately after the announcement, some Arbicorp investors took their complaints to Twitter. Replying to the announcement, an investor Diana Ruiz asks:

“Good afternoon, I want you to explain to me and I think we have that right to know what will happen with our investment, we are a family of brothers who invest all our capital in your company and we fully trust you, please we want the truth.”

Another investor, Jamerson Andres said:

“As for me, I have an account for a year from which I have not withdrawn much and at this moment when I look at it I see a lower investment than the initial one.”

Meanwhile, Arbicorp asks investors seeking any information on the closing and liquidation of community bot accounts to reach out.

Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, sees $11,000 as a key bitcoin price point. ”$11,000 has served as both support and resistance over the last two months,” Tu told CoinDesk. “If we properly break $11,000, we may head up towards $12,000 again while if we fail to break through, then we may go back towards $10,700 and then to $10,000.”

Thus far in September, bitcoin has been over the $11,000 mark twice, most recently on Wednesday prior to the U.S. Federal Reserve announcement of unchanged interest rates and allowing inflation to run over 2% in the near term.

Katie Stockton, analyst for Fairlead Strategies, sees a lack of momentum in the bitcoin market Thursday. “Today is an ‘inside-day’ for bitcoin, when the day’s high-low range is encompassed by the previous day’s range, so the action is not impacting the chart in a meaningful way.” Indeed, Wednesday’s bitcoin price range was wider, at $10,662-$11,099 per bitcoin.

In the options market, implied volatility, a measure of bitcoin’s forecasted price movement, is much higher than realized volatility, which is based on historical price changes.

This phenomenon has been occurring since July as options traders are increasingly hedging their bitcoin bets, said William Purdy, an options trader and founder of PurdyAlerts, an analysis firm.

“The historical realized volatility has significantly declined while implied volatility has increased as investors are increasingly willing to pay for more price protection,” said Purdy.

This is also happening in the ether options market, though not as pronounced as in bitcoin. Investors still expect an additional price boost from May’s halving, which reduced the new supply of bitcoin coming to market, according to Purdy.

“As we get later and later into the post-halvening cycle, traders are likely increasingly expecting a major price change and therefore expecting their already expensive premiums to still net positive ROI as they expect an even larger change in price,” Purdy told CoinDesk.

Ether fees rise again

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $388 and climbing 6.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, which invests in the decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem, says Uniswap’s surprise token launch is not helping the fee situation.

“There has been a fair amount of congestion for some time already and we now have the very popular one-off airdrop of the much awaited Uniswap token UNI that is the talk of the town,” said Bonnefous. “More tokens like YAM are going live this week also.

Regulations are required to ease the burden on companies working in the field, experts say.

“Several companies from this area are working on top notch cryptocurrency projects: like in DeFi, second layer protocol solutions for scaling of payment networks, blockchain based protocol for tokenisation of assets, but again it is hard to keep them here,” said Kamberi.

“We would need proactive, positive regulation in order to ease the burden of such start-ups and IT companies.”

One success story that others might try to emulate is Slovenia.

“Slovenia implemented crypto friendly regulations and this boosted the industry and the use of cryptocurrencies,” said Kamberi. “The country now has more than a thousand places in which you can spend cryptocurrencies – including major retailers like ‘Tuš’ or Burger King Slovenia.”

Serbia also seems ready and willing to adopt a set of crypto-regulations which would address cryptocurrency trading.

Belgrade-based Electronic Currency District, ECD, is a Bitcoin exchange that launched in 2012. Since then, their service has evolved and also opened branches across the region, the company told BIRN.

“We have added five new cryptocurrencies, we set up a network of Crypto ATMs in Serbia, developed application for bitcoin payments and opened branches in [North] Macedonia and Montenegro,” said co-founder and CEO Aleksandar Matanovic.

Currently the greatest potential in is remittances, Matanovic told BIRN.

“Remittances are probably the biggest chance for crypto to be used as money. The Balkans is a huge remittance market and sending money internationally is both faster and cheaper if you use crypto.”

“With a supportive regulatory framework, I really believe this industry could flourish, beneffiting not only those directly involved but also society as a whole.”

Some countries playing catch-up

Unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or Bulgaria, countries like North Macedonia are lagging behind, mostly due to the lack of any regulations whatsoever. And for those in the country looking to do business in cryptocurrency, it’s not straightforward.

“Trading mainly works through several crypto exchanges, most often Binance, and there are no obstacles here. Profit and exchange in denars usually goes through intermediaries, EU or Bulgarian residents,” said Petar Grujoski, a Skopje-based cryptocurrency enthusiast.

“Until recently, Macedonian citizens were not allowed to have accounts abroad, and we still do not have PayPal and Amazon for the same reason,” Grujoski told BIRN.

Cryptocurrency mining, on the other hand, can prove highly profitable in North Macedonia, not least because of cheap electricity supplies. The same applies to the rest of the region. But sometimes, when it comes to cryptocurrency mining and the rest of the infrastructure that can support the use of this technology, there are still some doubts.

“Regarding the infrastructure, if we look at the mining industry, electricity is in abundance and still quite cheap in some areas,” Kamberi said. “But mining can be a real environmental threat and the focus should be moved away from incentivising such an industry.”

“Regarding the use and payments infrastructure, the Internet coverage is still an issue in some areas. Anyhow, the ability to access the cryptocurrency payment networks using mobile devices and 3G connection makes it easier for users even in the most remote parts of the region.”",2020-09-17 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/42198/turkey-crypto-king-middle-east-report,"In brief Chainalysis this week released its 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.

The report shows that Turkey accounts for a large percentage of cryptocurrency use in the Middle East—in part due to the weak national currency.

The Middle East is still the second-smallest cryptocurrency market in the world.

Turkey is the undisputed cryptocurrency king of the Middle East, with the country adopting digital assets at significantly higher rates than neighboring countries, a new report by crypto forensics firm Chainalysis has revealed.

Turkey ranks 29th out of the 154 countries on Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index—and number one in the Middle East, according to the firm’s 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, published this week.

The country has long been a haven for cryptocurrency adoption, and the economic uncertainty in Turkey plays a part in soaring popularity, said Chainalysis. “The [Turkish] lira has been extremely volatile in recent years, prompting some to shift portions of their savings to cryptocurrency,” the report noted.

Currently there are no cryptocurrency regulations in Turkey—but the country’s Capital Markets Board (CMB) is in the process of developing a framework.

Chainalysis showed that most trades from the Middle East on major exchanges Binance, Huobi, and Bitfinex come from Turkish users.

On Turkey-based exchange BTCTurk, the most common trade is lira for Bitcoin, the report said, noting that it was “likely that most users utilize BTCTurk to purchase cryptocurrency before sending it to other, larger platforms like Binance that offer more liquidity and trading pairs.”

The report also showed that pre-existing adoption of mobile fintech and payments platforms was higher in Turkey than elsewhere in the region and that an incoming regulatory framework would likely lead to more crypto adoption.

Even before Covid-19 hit Turkey’s economy hard, the country was struggling: the economy slid into recession at the end of 2018. Foreign debt and unemployment has long been high.

The lira is also very weak. This year it hit record lows—a 20% fall—making it the third-weakest currency in the world in 2020, according to Reuters.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, Chainalysis noted that other countries are ahead of the game in terms of regulation, government acceptance, and promotion—despite having lower levels of adoption. The Middle East remains, however, the second-smallest cryptocurrency market in the world, according to the report, behind Africa.",2020-09-17 21:34:16

Bitcoin was only able to eclipse the $11,000 level briefly Friday before dropping to as low as $10,812 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.

“Markets are looking weak on drying-up liquidity on exchanges while BTC hardly managed to reach back above the $11,000 level and couldn’t sustain it,” said Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at trading firm ExoAlpha.

Indeed, major USD/BTC exchange volumes are looking feeble, with Friday tallying a $211 million total so far while daily averages the past month have been $364 million.

“I think equities are headed lower and if that happens digital assets will get sucked down, too,” Douglas told CoinDesk. “The tech shares are too frothy,” he added

Stock markets globally were mixed to cap off the week:

Another factor crypto investors are tracking: Bitcoin dominance, a measure of its market capitalization as a percentage of total cryptocurrencies. September has seen bitcoin hit 2020 dominance lows, hovering around 60% Friday.

“So far, bitcoin dominance has largely been sliding downwards since the beginning of 2020,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “It will be interesting to see if we see a short-term reversion of the bitcoin dominance back upwards.”

ExoAlpha’s Pavageau says decentralized finance, or DeFi, is captivating the crypto market, and that is causing weakness for bitcoin.

“The market is focused on DeFi. It seems that locking value is also draining liquidity from exchanges as traders are noticing higher slippage when executing in the market,” Pavageau said. “A question to ask might be: Is the total value locked a threat to market liquidity for active traders?”

Uniswap crosses $1.5 billion locked

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $379 and slipping 2.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The amount of cryptocurrency “locked” in decentralized exchange Uniswap has crossed $1.5 billion for the first time since Sept. 7. Investors have been quickly plowing crypto into Uniswap’s smart contracts over the past 24 hours, an 80% increase in value locked for that time period.

The dynamics of Uniswap have changed due to the decentralized exchange’s decision to release its own token, known as UNI, said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer for investment firm Ether Capital.

“Users are likely locking ETH into Uniswap because they want to farm the $UNI token,” Mosoff said. “Many crypto users see Uniswap as the category leader, and rightfully so given the team and its backers. Users want to participate financially in the growth of the platform.”

DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn’t controlled by a single, central source. That’s important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.

Bitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With bitcoin, those institutions are cut out of the picture.

Direct purchases aren’t the only type of transaction or contract overseen by big companies; financial applications such as loans, insurance, crowdfunding, derivatives, betting and more are also in their control. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one of the primary advantages of DeFi.

Before it was commonly known as decentralized finance, the idea of DeFi was often called “open finance.”

Ethereum applications

Most applications that call themselves “DeFi” are built on top of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency platform, which sets itself apart from the Bitcoin platform in that it’s easier to use to build other types of decentralized applications beyond simple transactions. These more complex financial use cases were even highlighted by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin back in 2013 in the original Ethereum white paper.

That’s because of Ethereum’s platform for smart contracts – which automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met – offers much more flexibility. Ethereum programming languages, such as Solidity, are specifically designed for creating and deploying such smart contracts.

For example, say a user wants his or her money to be sent to a friend next Tuesday, but only if the temperature climbs above 90 degrees Fahrenheit according to weather.com. Such rules can be written in a smart contract.

With smart contracts at the core, dozens of DeFi applications are operating on Ethereum, some of which are explored below. Ethereum 2.0, a coming upgrade to Ethereum’s underlying network, could give these apps a boost by chipping away at Ethereum’s scalability issues.

The most popular types of DeFi applications include:

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) : Online exchanges help users exchange currencies for other currencies, whether U.S. dollars for bitcoin or ether for DAI. DEXs are a hot type of exchange, which connects users directly so they can trade cryptocurrencies with one another without trusting an intermediary with their money.

Prediction markets: Markets for betting on the outcome of future events, such as elections. The goal of DeFi versions of prediction markets is to offer the same functionality but without intermediaries.

In addition to these apps, new DeFi concepts have sprung up around them:

DeFi apps can be similarly snapped together like ""money legos"" to build new financial products.

Lending platforms

Lending markets are one popular form of DeFi, which connects borrowers to lenders of cryptocurrencies. One popular platform, Compound, allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies or offer their own loans. Users can make money off of interest for lending out their money. Compound sets the interest rates algorithmically, so if there’s higher demand to borrow a cryptocurrency, the interest rates will be pushed higher.

DeFi lending is collateral-based, meaning in order to take out a loan, a user needs to put up collateral – often ether, the token that powers Ethereum. That means users don’t give out their identity or associated credit score to take out a loan, which is how normal, non-DeFi loans operate.

Stablecoins

Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often experience sharper price fluctuations than fiat, which isn’t a good quality for people who want to know how much their money will be worth a week from now. Stablecoins peg cryptocurrencies to non-cryptocurrencies, such as the U.S. dollar, in order to keep the price under control. As the name implies, stablecoins aim to bring price “stability.”

Prediction markets

One of the oldest DeFi applications living on Ethereum is a so-called “prediction market,” where users bet on the outcome of some event, such as “Will Donald Trump win the 2020 presidential election?”

The goal of the participants is, obviously, to make money, though prediction markets can sometimes better predict outcomes than conventional methods, like polling. Centralized prediction markets with good track records in this regard include Intrade and PredictIt. DeFi has the potential to boost interest in prediction markets, since they are traditionally frowned upon by governments and often shut down when run in a centralized manner.

DeFi FAQ

How do I make money with DeFi?

The value locked up in Ethereum DeFi projects has been exploding, with many users reportedly making a lot of money.

Using Ethereum-based lending apps, as mentioned above, users can generate “passive income” by loaning out their money and generating interest from the loans. Yield farming, described above, has the potential for even larger returns, but with larger risk. It allows for users to leverage the lending aspect of DeFi to put their crypto assets to work generating the best possible returns. However, these systems tend to be complex and often lack transparency.

Is investing in DeFi safe?

No, it’s risky. Many believe DeFi is the future of finance and that investing in the disruptive technology early could lead to massive gains.

But it’s difficult for newcomers to separate the good projects from the bad. And, there has been plenty of bad.

As DeFi has increased in activity and popularity through 2020, many DeFi applications, such as meme coin YAM, have crashed and burned, sending the market capitalization from $60 million to $0 in 35 minutes. Other DeFi projects, including Hotdog and Pizza, faced the same fate, and many investors lost a lot of money.

In addition, DeFi bugs are unfortunately still very common. Smart contracts are powerful, but they can’t be changed once the rules are baked into the protocol, which often makes bugs permanent and thus increasing risk.

When will DeFi go mainstream?

While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it’s hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don’t traditionally have access to such platforms.

This financial technology is new, experimental and isn’t without problems, especially with regard to security or scalability.

Developers hope to eventually rectify these problems. Ethereum 2.0 could tackle scalability concerns through a concept known as sharding, a way of splitting the underlying database into smaller pieces that are more manageable for individual users to run.

How will Ethereum 2.0 impact DeFi?

Ethereum 2.0 isn’t a panacea for all of DeFi’s issues, but it’s a start. Other protocols such as Raiden and TrueBit are also in the works to further tackle Ethereum’s scalability issues.

If and when these solutions fall into place, Ethereum’s DeFi experiments will have an even better chance of becoming real products, potentially even going mainstream.

Bitcoin as DeFi

While Ethereum is top dog in the DeFi world, many proponents of Bitcoin share the goal of cutting the middleman out of more complex financial transactions, and they’ve developed ways to do so using the Bitcoin protocol.",2020-09-18 21:02:41+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cryptoassets-idUSKBN2692CP,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will introduce new rules within four years to make cross-border payments quicker and cheaper through the use of blockchain and crypto assets like stablecoins, two EU documents showed.

The European Commission is due to set out its strategy for encouraging greater use of digital finance at a time when 78% of payments in the euro zone are in cash. It also wants a rapid shift to “instant” payments generally as pandemic lockdowns showed the growing role of cashless payments.

The EU executive will present a draft law to clarify how existing rules apply to crypto assets and set out new rules where there are gaps, the documents said.

“By 2024, the EU should put in place a comprehensive framework enabling the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and crypto-assets in the financial sector,” the documents said. “It should also address the risks associated with these technologies.”

Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency often backed by traditional assets, leapt onto policymakers’ agendas last year when Facebook revealed plans for its Libra token. Central banks are now studying whether to launch their own.

Brussels also wants to make it easier to share data within the financial sector to encourage competition and a wider range of services, while upholding the principle of “same risk, same rules, same regulation”, the documents say.

The bloc should also have rules in place within four years to allow new customers to start using financial services quickly once anti-money laundering and identity checks have been completed, it said.

“By 2024, the principle of passporting and a one-stop shop licensing should apply in all areas which hold strong potential for digital finance,” it said. Instant payment systems should become the “new normal” by the end of 2021.

Instant payments are suitable for many uses beyond traditional credit transfers, in particular for physical and online purchases, which are currently dominated by payment card schemes, the documents said.

Europe has long sought “home grown” alternatives to the likes of MasterCard and Visa, the U.S. payments firms heavily used in the region.

The Commission will assess the impact of charges levied on consumers for instant payments and to could require that they are no higher than those for regular credit transfers.",2020-09-18 14:44:31+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/09/166922-bitmex-installs-blockstreams-bitcoin-btc-satellite-system-as-number-of-cryptocurrency-atms-to-pass-10000-globally/,"The research division at the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) confirms that they’ve installed the Blockstream Bitcoin Satellite system, which offers a way to download and verify Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain through satellite, without requiring an Internet connection.

The BitMEX team said they were able to set up the system fairly quickly and the satellite connection does have the bandwidth needed to “keep the node at Bitcoin’s tip, most of the time.”

BitMEX further noted:

“We conclude by establishing that although many Bitcoin enthusiasts are likely to find installing and running the system enjoyable, it is unlikely to serve any practical purpose for most users. However, because this satellite based system does have the potential to improve the censorship resistance characteristics of the Bitcoin network and defend against some forms of eclipse attacks, its existence is probably a positive development.”

The leading crypto derivatives exchange added that following on from their experimentation with Bitcoin (BTC) miners recently, they decided to install and use the “Bitcoin Satellite,” which is a product offered by Blockstream, a company that supports Bitcoin’s ongoing development. BitMEX noted that they ordered the Blockstream Satellite Pro Kit and Blockstream’s Flat-Panel Antenna which are priced at around S$1,200.

The exchange claims that the installation process was pretty straightforward. It took them about a few hours to complete. (Note: more details about this process are available here.)

Bitcoin adoption is on the rise, globally. One of the ways to determine whether people are actually conducting BTC transactions for making daily purchases is to check how many Bitcoin ATMs have been installed.

As confirmed in a note shared with Crowdfund Insider, the number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide will soon pass the 10,000 benchmark. This milestone has been achieved only 7 years after these machines were introduced.

As noted in an update by the CoinFlip team:

“This is a huge indication of Covid-19’s effect on the industry, as we have seen ATMs grow from just 7500 in January to hit the 10K benchmark in such a short period of time. Thus signifying a broader trend in finance toward decentralized and more innovative forms of financial interactions.”

Daniel Polotsky, CEO and co-founder at CoinFlip, one of the leading bitcoin ATM operators in the US, has managed to help his company grow their network of over 850 ATMs in 45 US states.

As covered recently, Bitcoin (BTC) wealth has become more evenly distributed with smaller accounts holding a greater proportion of supply, according to a new report.

Cross-border payments remain inefficient with $48 billion lost in fees each year, but Bitcoin (BTC) might solve the problem, according to OpenNode.",2020-09-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/australia-government-employee-mining-cryptocurrency-supercomputers-prison,"Disclosure

The CSBS announced a “One Company, One Exam” plan Tuesday whereby states will coordinate their supervisory exams for the nation’s largest payment firms in an effort to reduce the costs on both state regulators and the companies they oversee. Essentially, the exam is how these regulators will make sure regulated entities are still in compliance.

What this means for cryptocurrency companies – such as Coinbase – is their compliance costs will drop. Rather than work with more than 50 different state and territory regulators, the exchanges only need to check in with the one group. The group of regulators includes every state but Montana, which doesn’t have a money transmission license.

Crypto exchanges need money transmission licenses to legally operate within most states, with the state banking or financial services regulator overseeing this form of regulated activity.

“For the industry that means there’s going to be a reduction in regulatory burden,” said Matt Lambert, nonbank counsel for CSBS.

However, new exchanges will still have to apply for, and secure, a license for each state in which they hope to operate. While the CSBS is working on a potential standard for applications, there’s still a long way to go.

At present the move also only applies to the 78 largest money transmitters in the U.S. – those operating in at least 40 states. While Lambert declined to identify which crypto businesses fit into this category, a search of the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry database indicates this could include Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and Square.

The list of firms that will benefit from CSBS’ announcement could still grow. While there aren’t any plans right now to add to the list of companies, Lambert said more could be added later on.

‘Strictest standards’

The CSBS announced its effort to consolidate supervision at least partly as a result of soliciting feedback from the crypto industry, and finding that regulated entities believed “there is too much supervision that is accomplishing the same thing,” Lambert said.

“Overall I think this process will lead to high standards, the strictest standards,” he said. “This is not going to be a means of defaulting to the lowest standards, this is going to be a method of raising the bar for everyone.”

Each exam will be conducted by a group of state regulators, and the makeup of the group will change on an exam-by-exam basis. This lets the regulators coordinate among themselves to find the best fit for each company’s evaluation.

One state will lead the other group members in administering each exam.

Daniel Gorfine, the former fintech innovation lead at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a director with the Digital Dollar Project, told CoinDesk the move helps in the development of regulations around fintech.

“This approach would be similar to the dual banking system, which recognizes state and federally chartered banks and has been effective in safely promoting competition, innovation and choice both for consumers as well as industry,” he said.

Linda Lacewell, Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, echoed his view, saying on Twitter a dual banking system is needed as states better understand their local ecosystems.

Lowered costs

By coordinating, the states are able to save their own resources.

Lambert said the different states will be able to reduce their supervisory costs because they won’t have to conduct every exam.

“If you only have one exam nationwide you can make sure the best examiners are at that exam and can leverage the resources of the states,” he said.

Lacewell said on Twitter the move would also “reduce burdens on the industry.”

Regulated companies will also find their own bills reduced, said Brian Nistler, an attorney with Lowenstein Sandler. He told CoinDesk the first effect is “an overdue reduction in compliance costs and regulatory redundancies for money service businesses and the state regulators.”

This is especially important because costs for the crypto industry have “ballooned” over the last few years, he said. As a result, entities have been asking for the exams to be streamlined for some time now.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire agreed, saying in a statement the move would streamline his company’s efforts to work with state banking regulators.

He said the new framework indicates “very significant progress for crypto and fintech firms.”

“[It ensures] that there is a consistent and well-run process for examining firms and ensuring that they can meet their regulatory obligations,” he said.

National framework

What Tuesday’s announcement does not do is create a national framework for crypto companies. However, it is the latest move in a years-long effort to more closely coordinate between the states, Lambert said.

“The states have been working together in the supervision of money transmitters for a long time. Originally it was through the money transmitter regulators association and they continue to work through the states,” he said.

A possible next step may come through the creation of a multi-state licensing agreement. This project, which has also been in the works for some time, has about 29 states on board so far.

It’s unclear whether such an effort would negate the need for a federal charter, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks has suggested. As detailed, his proposed charter would allow fintech firms to bypass the state-by-state framework entirely.

Nistler noted that when the states were writing their various money transmitter license regulations, “no one thought the states would be responsible for regulating borderless online platforms,” which was a view Gorfine shared.

Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, said a national framework or federal law is still needed. “It makes little sense to have a patchwork of regulation and supervision,” she said.

Brooks congratulated CSBS for its announcement, but also indicated he agrees with the idea of a federal authority overseeing payment firms.",2020-09-18 10:02:05+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/switchere-buy-crypto-with-cc-pay-with-local-banks-swap-and-sell-coins-online/,"Switchere: Buy Crypto with CC, Pay with Local Banks, Swap and Sell Coins Online

Presently, the crypto market is witnessing an incredible growth and massive adoption worldwide. Digital transformation and tokenization give freedom to deployment of cryptocurrencies in everyday life. However, one thing worth careful considering is how to choose a trustworthy online crypto exchange without fearing to lose money because of fraud or poor service provision? The following article describes major cornerstones while opting for buying or selling coins with reference to licensed crypto exchange Switchere.com.

High Demand for Reliable and Solid Online Crypto Exchange Services

If the core goal is to buy crypto with credit card or convert USD to BTC to diversify the current financial portfolio, then the best option is to go for online crypto exchange services (approx. 5min. to buy cryptocurrency). The same concerns if the person is willing to sell BTC at a competitive rate and with perfect timing — choose a licensed and reputable crypto exchange that offers both of these options (buy and sell) because by doing so, the financial risks are minimized. Alternatively, if one is set to market speculations on crypto price swings, then cryptocurrency trading platforms are the best variants.

Buy Cryptocurrency at Licensed and Regulated Crypto Exchange

For any crypto exchange, obtaining a license of a virtual currency exchange provider is a must. If you knew success was a certainty, what would you attempt to do? Correct — choose a licensed and reputable crypto exchange because it is perfect both for professionals and newbies alike. The main idea behind Switchere is to make the process of buying, selling and swapping cryptocurrencies for all platform users as easy as an online shopping tour.

Buy Bitcoin and Altcoins at AML/KYC Compliant Crypto Exchange

All AML/KYC complaint crypto exchanges uphold the lowest fraud rates. All licensed exchange service providers are perfectly compliant with all regulatory requirements (GDPR, CFT, AML/KYC, etc). Nowadays, it is a golden rule for crypto adepts to buy Bitcoin and altcoins at fully licensed and AML compliant crypto exchanges.

Use Easy USD to Bitcoin Converter with No Hidden Fees

Today, people can buy BTC with any credit, debit or prepaidcard (VISA, Mastercard, Maestro, American Express, etc.) — it is the fastest and most convenient way to purchase crypto. Nonetheless, it is really important to pay close attention to service pricing and make sure there are no hidden commissions charged on the checkout form. Seek for transparent and straightforward service providers and make sure that all bank card payments are 3DS (PCI SSC standard). As an alternative to USD to Bitcoin converter, there is a good opportunity to swap one cryptocurrency into another. As such, always look for multicurrency capabilities (BTC, ETH, USDT, LTC, XRP, DASH, etc.) and versatile payment methods (region-specific online banking, e-wallets, SWIFT, SEPA, wire transfer, etc.) that suit you the most. Life is full of choices, so choose wisely.

Easy Workflow, Seamless Order Processing and Speedy Delivery

When it comes to choosing a perfect spot for exchanging crypto, the key factors that come into play are ease-of-use and on-timedelivery. The onboarding process should not take long and the verification procedure has to be automated to the fullest extent— 15 min. on average. These are the determining factors for establishing excellent customer loyalty and seamless user experience. In addition, fast order processing (approx. 2-30 minutes) adds credibility and trust to the service provider.

Global Coverage, Accessibility and Interoperability

For a licensed crypto exchange service provider, the operational areas should cover Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America and South America. The list of restricted locations can be limited only to the high-risk countries defined by the FATF. Going global means being more local. The process of buying, selling or swapping crypto has to be a pleasant online shopping tour that goes hand in hand with fast transaction processing, simple and intuitive user interface and proven reliability.

Top Security Standards and Data Encryption

The biggest concern for any person using the services of an online cryptocurrency exchange is the likelihood of fraud or hacks due to poor security standards. It is of great importance to look for the following features enabled on any solid and reliable crypto exchange:

1) Two-factor authentication (2FA), such as Google Authenticator, Authy, Yubikey or SMS;

2) Email and SMS informing;

3) SSL/TLS advanced encryption standards;

4) Automatic inactivity logouts.

5) Complex captchas.

6) Whitelisting of wallet addresses.

Ongoing Loyalty Program, Regular Discounts and Special Offers

In layman’s terms, customer loyalty is a customer’s willingness to interact with or buy from a specific company on a regular basis. Consumers who are already enthusiastic about a particular brand or trademark are more likely to continue using the crypto exchange services. Reward programs may include affiliate/referral/partner programs (passive income for participant may reach up to 70%), special offers, discounts, use of promotional codes for reduced service commission, free welcome and deposit bonuses, among others. Demonstratively, Switchere offers its customers its unique cashback program (up to 1%) for each successful order payment. Besides, the crypto exchange runs 2-level Affiliate program, where platform users can earn affiliate rewards (55% and 5%) for primary and secondary referrals, respectively. On top of that, every newly registered user can make the first order payment with no service fee whatsoever. As a result, great loyalty programs helpestablishing brand loyalty and customer recognition.

Do Your Own Research (DYOR)

Doing your own research (DYOR) is one of the most important aspects of engagement in the crypto market — and not only regarding online crypto exchanges. Search for genuine customer reviews, rating and user feedback, monitor media appearance for a particular crypto exchange. A scrupulous research may prove exceptionally valuable for anyone interested in crypto, DeFi, dApps, bitcoin mining and alike.

Conclusion

In summary, keep in mind all the above mentioned points and always weigh all pros and cons when the deal concerns your finances. Seamless user experience, auto verification, fast order processing, license and accreditation, reputation, top security standards, loyalty programs are one of the most important things to consider while choosing a reliable crypto exchange. Dream big, act quickly and create your own path to success in the fast-evolving digital world.

Crypto activity continues to flourish worldwide, according to a new cryptocurrency adoption index published by the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis. The researchers compile onchain digital currency retail value transferred, onchain crypto deposits, peer-to-peer exchange volume, and other types of methodology.

Chainalysis recently published a new report called the “2020 Geography of Crypto,” a study that examines 154 countries and the flourishing cryptocurrency adoption in these areas. The company created a crypto adoption index from the large list of nation-states and only 12 countries had very little traction compared to the rest.

Nation-states that ranked the lowest in the adoption index include Afghanistan, Algeria, Cape Verde, Chad, Fiji, Laos, Libya, and Mongolia.

The top ten countries are ranked by four individual metrics that are combined to create the official ranking. The top country, as far as onchain value received, onchain retail value received, number of onchain deposits, and peer-to-peer trade volume is the Ukraine.

This country is followed by Russia, Venezuela, China, Kenya, U.S., South Africa, Nigeria, Colombia, and Vietnam respectively. “Cryptocurrency is truly global,” the Chainalysis report notes. “Developing countries have high grassroots cryptocurrency activity,” the study adds.

Chainalysis continues by adding:

Venezuela is an excellent example of what drives cryptocurrency adoption in developing countries and how citizens use [crypto] to mitigate economic instability— Venezuelans use cryptocurrency more when the country’s native fiat currency loses value to inflation.

The study emphasizes that the wealth preservation tactic is leveraged in Africa and East Asia as well. Moreover, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges are essential to digital currency adoption in developing nations, Chainalysis highlights.

In the section that covers Africa, the blockchain intelligence firm says both remittances and currency devaluation is what’s driving crypto adoption throughout the large continent. The study notes that major cryptocurrency trading platforms now look at Africa as an “opportunity.”

Chainalysis details that in Africa regions like Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa have been seeing more adoption than other areas throughout the continent. Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) is also covered in the Chainalysis study and researchers say growth is “already strong.”

The CSAO area is seeing a number of cryptocurrency regulations adopted within a variety of countries. CSAO is the fifth-most active region worldwide when it comes to cryptocurrency activity and it’s seen over $41 billion sent and $40 billion received during the last 12 months.

East Asia is the world’s largest crypto market, in terms of crypto activity, capturing 31% of all the digital currency transactions in the last year. Crypto addresses stemming from East Asia accounted for $107 billion received.

East Asia’s cumulated data is 77% larger than the crypto activity in Northern and Western Europe. East Asia is dominated by “pro traders” and “stablecoins,” the Chainalysis report highlights. Stablecoin usage in East Asia is “off the charts” in comparison to other regions worldwide.

Eastern Europe has the fourth-largest crypto activity rating globally, and it also contains the top two countries represented in the Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index: Ukraine and Russia. “Eastern Europe shows a strong grassroots-level of cryptocurrency adoption,” Chainalysis notes.

One reason Russia and Ukraine take the cake, as far as cryptocurrency activity is concerned, is because adoption has come “amidst regulatory uncertainty.” For instance, Chainalysis says that Ukraine has zero crypto regulations, but the government just started monitoring crypto activity.

Latin America is smaller in terms of onchain activity, and cryptocurrency adoption is low in contrast to the aforementioned regions. Latin America saw $25 billion in crypto assets sent and $24 billion received in the one-year timeframe.

In any 30-day span, Latin America represents 5% to 9% of the crypto activity aggregate on any given month, Chainalysis emphasizes. Even though Chainalysis says the region is one of the “hottest markets,” it also holds the second-lowest growth rate from the regions the researchers studied.

The crypto forensics firm says the Middle East is a smaller digital currency ecosystem, and the region is the second-smallest worldwide. According to the “2020 Geography of Crypto” study, Turkey captures the most crypto activity in the Middle East. Out of the 154 countries Chainalysis studied, Turkey ranks 29th in the crypto adoption index.

Chainalysis mentions that Turkey is a strong crypto adopter due to the Turkish lira falling in value. The fiat currency crisis was sparked by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarianism and Turkey’s mountains of private foreign-currency-denominated debt.

Toward the end of the report, Chainalysis touches on North America (the United States & Canada), which captures “conservative buy-and-hold” investors, and institutional investors as well. North America accounted for $52 billion sent and the same value received during the course of the 12-month span.

“North America is the third most active region by cryptocurrency volume moved onchain, just behind Nothern & Western Europe (NWE) and well behind East Asia,” Chainalysis says. Addresses stemming from North America accounted for 14% of all the crypto activity studied during the company’s research.

Chainalysis further notes:

North America also hosts a growing class of institutional investors conducting even larger transfers of cryptocurrency.

Additionally, Chainalysis highlights that a number of the global regions have formed crypto alliances. “North America and Nothern & Western Europe (NWE) form a quasi-common market, plus heavy trade with East Asia,” the “2020 Geography of Crypto” findings detail.

NWE has a “strong professional market” but also a “surprising” amount of illicit activity. As far as crypto activity is concerned, NWE is the second-largest territory behind East Asia. The NWE region accounts for 17% of all the crypto transactions worldwide.

NWE exhibits similar characteristics to North America in terms of institutional and professional traders. However, NWE’s crypto activity is also “largely driven by ransomware and darknet markets.”

The 130-page study shows that crypto adoption and activity has grown exponentially in certain regions. A number of other countries and the regional bureaucrats are just becoming aware of cryptocurrency technology, and are falling behind the eight-ball in comparison.

Today in 2020, East Asia is the crowned king of crypto activity worldwide with NWE following behind the region. The report concludes with an interactive crypto index table that shows all 154 countries’ Chainalysis studied during the year.

Key Takeaways Over 15,000 WBTC was minted since Sept. 17 prompted by UNI token yield farming incentives on Uniswap.

The comparative returns for Bitcoin-based pools are higher than Ethereum and Chainlink on DeFi platforms like yEarn Finance.

Curve added a new HBTC pool alongside the existing BTC-based pool backed by RenBTC, wBTC and sBTC.

Share this article

WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) added 15,000 tokens 24 hours after UNI token launch, taking the amount Bitcoin locked in DeFi to $1.2 billion. High returns on Bitcoin-specific pools is another impetus for the mass move.

The Uniswap Effect

Wrapped Bitcoin is tokenized BTC issued on Ethereum. Launched in January 2019, WBTC had a relatively slow growth until the explosion of DeFi’s yield farming. WBTC has surpassed $800 million in locked value, adding Bitcoins worth $500 million since August.

Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), which is leaving centralized exchanges like Coinbase behind.

The WBTC-ETH pool on Uniswap has become a significant source of attraction as it is one of four pools on Uniswap with added UNI token incentives.

Currently, the WBTC-ETH pool is the largest pool on Uniswap in total liquidity at $391 million. This amounts to a staggering 900% increase since Sept. 17. The relative volume of other WBTC pools on Uniswap paints a clear picture of the source of the demand.

While the WBTC-ETH pool 24-hour volume is close to $40 million, it is zero for the other WBTC pools.

New UNI-incentivized pools will not be added for the next 30 days within the governance grace period. This indicates that the expansion of the pool is likely to continue.

The other pools which qualified for yield farming UNI include DAI-ETH, USDT-ETH, USDC-ETH. These pools expanded by 880%, 136%, and 142%, respectively, since the announcement.

Bitcoin on Ethereum

The total value of BTC locked in smart contracts is $1.25 billion, at the time of writing.

Bitcoin pools and vaults are gaining more traction due to their high returns, causing an increase in the amount of minted WBTC, renBTC, and sBTC on Ethereum.

Tokenized Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token whose value is backed by actual BTC locked in the specific smart contracts. Tokenized BTC is compatible with DeFi platforms built on Ethereum.

RenBTC on Curve accounts for 18% of the total deposited value, just short of $1 billion. The yEarn Finance vaults’ annual returns for Curves’ sBTC LP comprising RenBTC, WBTC, and sBTC is around 30%. Whereas, the other two cryptocurrency-based vaults on Ether and Link project a yearly growth of 1.73% and 2.24% only.

Recently, Curve also added a new HBTC pool to its decentralized exchange platform. But the pool has only added $1,300 worth of HBTC in the one week of launch.

The liquidity mining returns on DeFi platforms increases the incentives for holding Bitcoin. However, these carry additional smart contract risks that come with the potential loss of actual Bitcoins backing the token.

Forced liquidation, loss of tokens, technical glitches, and theft are some of the few risks that come with Bitcoin minted on Ethereum.

If cryptocurrencies today are anything like the early days of the Internet, it’s crucial that women become more involved in this new frontier. With women making up half the world’s working-age population, and crypto being the future of money and investment – they should play a role in shaping it.

Fortunately, progress is being made and women are steadily becoming more interested in this new asset class. In 2017, only 5% to 7% of all cryptocurrency users were women. Yet two years later, Bitcoin fund operator Grayscale revealed that 43% of survey respondents that were interested in bitcoin investments were women. In places like India, women even make up the majority of crypto investors.

Why the sudden interest? As more women hear about the potential upsides of cryptocurrencies, more are getting involved. An increasing number of women are learning how to trade digital money while others are getting involved in tackling wide-ranging topics: from education and financial inclusion and empowerment to the digital chamber of commerce, crypto and banking nexus. Women are also becoming developers and strategists across blockchain, AI and big data.

There’s been a notable increase in female staff in key crypto firms like Coinbase, as well as Binance and Banco. These latter two exchanges were established by women and have a workforce that is now 40-50% female.

As more women get into the crypto space, we are also seeing some standout stars rising the ranks and making inroads in their careers. One recent story is that of Amiti Uttarwar. After studying at Carnegie Mellon, majoring in Information Systems, Uttarwar worked at a few startups in the Bay Area before introducing herself to Bitcoin. She then worked at Coinbase before being accepted for the Chaincode Residency for 2019 through Chaincode Labs. She is now the first confirmed female developer of Bitcoin Core and ‘the face of the New American Dream‘.

Other female employees are going on to front industry initiatives, such as Amber Baldet. She was the blockchain lead at JP Morgan, and was responsible for exploring how financial institutions could use technologies like blockchain. She helped to spearhead the Blockchain Center of Excellence at J.P. Morgan and acted as the chair of the financial industry working group of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

Baldet now sits on the board of the Zcash Foundation and leads her own blockchain startup. Clovyr helps consumers, developers, and enterprises explore the world of blockchain-based technologies – and advances the development of decentralised tools and products.

Women are also supporting the infrastructure for cryptocurrencies and using it to dominate their professions, notably the legal world, where female blockchain and cryptocurrency lawyers are taking on practice leadership roles at various major law firms in the United States, breaking the male-dominated leadership moulds in two fields at once.

A few years ago, law firms that practiced regulatory or securities work began fielding blockchain or cryptocurrency-related questions, but it wasn’t clear, inside the firms, as to who was best placed to answer such queries. These women had the foresight to assume that the position was open. They took the initiative to educate themselves, and eventually came to fill those roles.

As women become more comfortable in the crypto space we are seeing a steady birth of female founders stepping up to the plate and coming up with exciting business ideas that cater to women.

One such entrepreneur is Emmanuelle Collet, cofounder and chief marketing officer of Arianee. This French blockchain project is aimed at eliminating fraud and counterfeiting in the luxury market. She learned about cryptocurrency and blockchain while still working at the Swiss luxury watch brand Omega and completing an MBA. She could see this had the potential to change the customer experience, especially in the Asian market, and Arianee’s mission is to build a global standard for the digital certification of valuable objects.

We also see women helping at the philanthropic level. Connie Gallippi is the founder of BitGive, the first nonprofit in Bitcoin – which has also evolved into one of the most significant Bitcoin projects, in terms of its success and longevity. While at a Bitcoin conference in San Jose in 2013, Gallippi was struck by inspiration: she reasoned that the Bitcoin community needed a philanthropic arm, and that she would lead it. Now, BitGive is the top place to go if you have Bitcoin and are keen to give some of your digital cash to charitable causes.

So how do we get more women into the space? Education around blockchain and cryptocurrencies should be more readily available. Community building is also essential to bringing women into the world of crypto.

We are already seeing some excellent initiatives. Women blockchain pioneers and thought leaders banded together in 2017 to form Diversity in Blockchain – a nonprofit organisation committed to empowering people from all walks of life to engage with blockchain technology, through education, discussion, and engagement. There is also EWPN, which is dedicated to building a community for women in cards, fintech and payments in Europe.

Aside from community building, mentoring and profile-raising can go a long way to attracting more female talent and narrowing the gender gap. It’s also essential for each woman to establish a network of other women in the world of business, and in particular crypto: Wirex and myself are here and ready to help develop that network.

We know that it’s important that we recognise and celebrate the achievements of women in the new frontier. As the old saying goes, ‘you can’t be what you can’t see’ – and more female role models in this space will help to shepherd in the next generation. We know that diversity in teams improves decision-making, shapes strategy and helps focus on essentials.

When it comes to participating in this new form of wealth creation we must level the playing field and not leave it all to men. Crypto is the future of money, and money matters to everyone. Women should play a role in how it will transform the world we live in.",2020-09-19 10:01:13+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/illicit-crypto-transactions-are-getting-more-attention-from-the-government,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to focus on bringing blockchain technology to their financial services, along with the needed regulatory upgrades to keep the burgeoning fintech industry clean.

Furthermore, in a major milestone for the crypto industry, leading travel rule solutions nonprofit Travel Rule Information Sharing Alliance, or TRISA, from Ciphertrace and developer of the world’s first tracing tool for Monero, together with Sygna Bridge from CoolBitX announced their interoperability proof-of-concept, allowing crypto service providers from both platforms to meet the requirements as outlined by the travel rule. It is available to the public on GitHub.

The travel rule was introduced by the Financial Action Task Force in June 2019 and requires financial institutions participating in cryptocurrency transactions to exchange relevant beneficiary and originator Know Your Customer, or KYC, information. As a result, Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, between the two solutions can communicate compliance data with minimal disruption.

As Michael Ou, CEO of CoolBitX and creator of Sygna Bridge, explained: “In the last few years, several innovative solutions have appeared to help crypto and virtual asset businesses comply with anti-money laundering regulations that are beginning to develop around the world — each addressing the needs of different audiences. At the end of the day, money-laundering and terrorist financing are global issues that require the collaboration between different entities. This all begins with ensuring that the solutions are able to communicate effectively between each other. By adapting industry standards such as the IVMS101 and building tools to ensure correct translation and connectivity, Sygna Bridge and TRISA are working together to ensure that the cryptocurrency industry is growing and maturing in a positive direction.”

John Jefferies, chairman of TRISA, added:

“Achieving global interoperability for Travel Rule compliance across jurisdictions is vital for a successful sunrise phase. We are pleased to enable message interoperability and extend mutual VASP authentication in this Travel Rule proof of concept.”

According to statistics released by the United States Office on Drugs and Crime, up to $2 trillion is laundered on the global market annually, which bypasses the latest cryptocurrency KYC measures. Financial institutions could be missing up to 90% of cryptocurrency-related transactions, as they overlook lesser-known digital asset exchanges, according to the latest report by CipherTrace.

Until they are eventually caught by United States law enforcement, criminals prefer using cryptocurrency tumblers or cryptocurrency mixing services when paying for illicit goods and services that are transmitted with no oversight by governments or central banks, thereby obscuring the trail back to the fund’s original source.

Nearly a month after announcing the largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency assets used by terrorist organizations in a multi-agency investigation conducted alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Department of Homeland Security Investigations and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice showcased the results of a five-year operation targeting Mexican drug cartels on Sept. 3.

Robert Murphy, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s special agent in charge at Atlanta division, said:

“We have a Mexican drug cartel who initially came to our attention through U.S. Fish and Wildlife when they smuggled over 900 kilos of cocaine with frozen sharks.”

The indictment charged 12 defendants and two businesses with mail and wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry potential penalties of up to life in federal prison with no parole.

A week later, on Sept. 10, the DEA announced the results of a six-month operation, “Crystal Shield,” again targeting Mexican drug cartels operating major methamphetamine transportation hubs in the United States. The operation led to “nearly 1,840 arrests and the seizure of more than 28,560 pounds of methamphetamine, $43.3 million in drug proceeds, and 284 firearms.” The U.S. Attorney General William Barr said more than 60 Mexican cartel figures have been extradited this year, and more are expected. Barr added:

“Unfortunately Covid has intervened and has tempered a lot of the progress we had been making, reduced our momentum.”

These U.S. Federal agencies have bolstered their cryptocurrency oversight and enforcement efforts for 2021 — which begins in October of 2020 — with millions of dollars in new funding to shore up national and international cryptocurrency investigations.

The IRS is already spending some of that funding on a bounty of up to $625,000 to anyone who can crack untraceable privacy coins.

The IRS’s federal whistleblower program

It should be noted that the IRS has a federal whistleblower law program for informants (including foreigners) who provide information that leads to the collection of taxes, whether from undisclosed fiat or cryptocurrency, and offering up to 30% of the resulting tax and penalty revenue.

At the direction of Senator Charles Grassley, Dean Zerbe, a partner at law firm ZMFF&J, was responsible for the modern IRS whistleblower law, which was signed into law in 2006. He also established the IRS Whistleblower Office and created an award program for tax whistleblowers while he was senior counsel and tax counsel for the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, from 2001 to 2008.

This legislation led to the famous UBS tax evasion case that reverberated around the world. UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, admitted to helping Americans dodge taxes, and it agreed to pay the U.S. government $780 million. In a departure from its own legal standards, the Swiss government also divulged banking client secrets. Alarmed by the affair, many U.S. depositors pulled their money out of UBS, and thousands of tax-dodging Americans came clean with the IRS. The IRS awarded $104 million to the banker-turned-whistleblower who helped the government uncover the massive scheme, which was the largest bounty ever granted to a single whistleblower in the U.S. at the time.

As Dean Zerbe explained:

“The IRS released its 2019 annual report on the whistleblower program — showing over $616 million dollars brought into the Treasury thanks to the work of tax whistleblowers speaking out about tax evasion. [...] The trend is clear that the IRS has embraced the modern mandatory tax whistleblower program created by my old boss Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) — and it is honest taxpayers who have most benefited.”

The report makes note that whistleblowers can be paid for FBAR violations (undeclared foreign bank accounts) as well as criminal fines.

However, “the top reason — 51%! — whistleblower submission is rejected is because the submission is not specific. [...] The IRS does not want submissions that are speculative. The IRS wants and welcomes submissions that are grounded — particularly those coming from credible whistleblowers — containing known facts, dealing with specific taxpayers and ideally, with documents in hand and involving recent/current tax evasion,” pointed out Dean Zerbe.

Matt Kane’s “Right Place & Right Time,” a non-fungible token (NFT) digital artwork that changes every day with the bitcoin price volatility, claims the artist, has been sold for a record 262 ether or $101,100 on blockchain platform Async Art.

According to a description of the artwork on Async Art’s website, a new composition for the master is generated independently each day based on BTC’s volatility and price action from the previous 24 hours.

The work is composed of what the platform calls “layers”. Kane’s piece has 24 of these. Each hour’s price programmatically controls rotation, scale, and position of a correlating layer, it says. Viewers can surmise the day’s price volatility by examining the artwork. However, it appears that the artist himself might have some influence on the variations.

“It’s humbling. I’m most excited I’ve helped open price levels for other digital artists to have their work taken seriously and begin making a living from art sales,” said Chicago-born Kane, in a statement shared with news.Bitcoin.com.

“Until we could prove provenance and scarcity on the blockchain, how we sold digital art was prehistoric by comparison,” added the artist, who wrote the code, which generates the daily image changes.

Token Angels, a crypto-focussed angel investor, and art collector, bought Kane’s piece. Variations of the artwork will be minted over the next 10 years and the artist will periodically put an NFT digital art on market to represent an important day in the life of Bitcoin. This NFT will also grant its token holder the right to purchase a physical print.

“As a nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply, the collector receives 21% revenue share of the individual NFT and print sales and there will only be 210 NFTs minted,” said Matt Kane. The artistic experiment will run as a creative counterpart to Bitcoin, using visualized volatility to aid the artist in mining 210 NFTs, he explained, adding:

I’ll be investigating what a decentralized artwork can evolve into, as proof-of-work necessitates increasing challenges over time. But just like Bitcoin, the passage of time will be required in order to observe the grander masterpiece that is at work.

Async Art says more than $2.3 million has changed hands on the platform since launch in February 2020. Artist sales have totaled over $400,000, it says.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the platform specializes in something called programmable art – “digital paintings split into ‘layers’, which you use to affect the overall image.”

More than $109 million worth of NFTs has been sold throughout the world since such sales started a few years ago, according to data from nonfungible.com. That’s from 4.82 million pieces sold at an average price of $22.65.

Bitcoin (BTC) is regularly championed as the most secure cryptocurrency out there, but even it’s vulnerable to the occasional bug, also meaning that BTC forks might be suffering from the same problem.

This unavoidable fact was brought home at the beginning of September, when a research paper revealed that Bitcoin harbored a severe denial-of-service vulnerability.

The paper explains that the bug was discovered — and patched — in 2018, yet it represents the very first disclosure of this bug. Given that it was published some two years after the vulnerability’s discovery, it raises important questions about disclosures in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including the question of whether developers have an obligation to notify the public of dangers more quickly.

According to developers speaking to Cryptonews.com, keeping software bugs a closely guarded secret (at least until a fix is rolled out) is in the best interests of Bitcoin and its users. At the same time, crypto exchanges take steps to ensure that no developer(s) with foreknowledge of bugs tries to profit from insider trading.

The book and a moral obligation

Having discovered the bug on June 22, 2018, Purse developer Braydon Fuller notified Bitcoin Core developers on July 9, 2018, with a patch being rolled out a day later by Matt Corallo, Wladimir J. van der Laan, and other maintainers.

No one else was notified, although the existence of the bug in other forks of Bitcoin (such as Decred (DCR)) was discovered in July of this year, a fact which may have led Braydon Fuller and Bitcoin developer Javed Khan to belatedly publish their findings in September.

However, while this suggests that the people involved may have been ‘hiding’ vulnerabilities and that they didn’t follow due disclosure process, other developers and people involved in the crypto industry affirmed that things were pretty much done by the book.

“I'd say that if someone not working on the project came across a bug, they have a moral obligation to inform the code owner or maintainer as soon as possible via the responsible disclosures process,” said Ben Chan, Chief Technology Office at BitGo, a major crypto custody company.

This is exactly what Braydon Fuller did in 2018. He notified Bitcoin Core developers as soon as he confirmed that the exploit affected the latest version of the protocol.

He also notified developers using encrypted email, which again is standard practice. “For Bitcoin core, you can use [email protected], and encrypt the message via GPG to the developer you prefer to contact,” said Bitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier.

Some may be tempted to fault Bitcoin Core developers for not publicizing the vulnerability after it had been patched. According to Dorier, explicitly publicizing a specific bug isn’t necessary, so long as the developers actually patch it and ensure that everyone updates their software.

“The devs fix the bug without disclosing, and when the fix has been sufficiently distributed so that an exploit can't do any harm, there is the disclosure to the public.

Sometimes devs can say ‘stop using this version, there is a critical vulnerability that we will patch in 6 months’,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Likewise, it’s standard tech industry practice to keep knowledge of a bug to as few people as possible, particularly before a fix is developed.

“As few as possible,” agreed Dorier, “and in general, developers prefer to not be aware of it, to avoid suspicion if there is a leak.”

Fellow Bitcoin developer Bryan Bishop also affirmed that announcing a vulnerability — even after an update has been released — may not be the best way to go, and that not announcing it is standard in software development.

“They cannot announce the vulnerability because without enough time for users to upgrade, there would be greater opportunity for harm. Everything about that is standard and normal,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Associated risks

Disclosure issues are complicated by altcoins, particularly those altcoins forked from other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. On the one hand, publicly sharing a vulnerability may put forked coins at risk of attack, while on the other, not sharing bugs may leave forked coins exposed if another researcher independently discovers the same exploit.

“However, I think what people forget, especially about altcoins, is that these vulnerabilities don't necessarily get reported to all the 1,000s of forked coins,” said Bryan Bishop.

According to him, at some point, broadcasting security information to a group of thousands of other developers is equivalent or just as damaging as broadcasting vulnerability information to the general public.

“The consequence of this is that there are some projects that just aren't in the loop on security issues,” he added, a point emphasized by the fact that Decred still had the June 2018 vulnerability two years later.

Another possible risk is insider trading, as explained to Cryptonews.com by a spokesperson for BitMEX.

“There is of course insider risk around the disclosure of bugs, where for example people with knowledge of a vulnerability could short bitcoin and then profit if the revelation of the vulnerability causes network issues and crashes the price,” they said.

BitMEX’s spokesperson stated that the exchange takes this risk very seriously. “That is why we are keen to attempt to remain on top of these issues by running many versions of Bitcoin and implementing automated alert systems, such as the unexpected inflation detection system.”

A study from the team at Kisspatent shows that Alibaba Group is the largest blockchain patent holder in 2020 capturing 10x the number of patents held by IBM. The report notes that blockchain patents “are skyrocketing” this year and so far in 2020, there’s been more distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrency patents published than all of 2019.

It seems distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrency solution patents are becoming a thing again in 2020. A few years ago various reports said that Bank of America (BoA) and the firm Nchain were gobbling up all the patents applied to digital assets and blockchain technology.

Times have changed in 2020, and both companies have slid down the ranks as far as top blockchain holders are concerned this year.

Kisspatent’s latest study shows that Alibaba Group was the top company this year with successful blockchain patent filing and IBM jumped significantly. Alibaba Group is the top blockchain patent holder while the Chinese multinational technology company is followed by the financial institution BoA.

While Alibaba and IBM were the top two blockchain patent filing contenders in 2020, Alibaba outpaced IBM by 10x the number of patents. Moreover, this year has already seen “3 times more blockchain patents published than in 2018.”

Behind IBM, is Mastercard, Nchain, and Walmart respectively in terms of blockchain patents held. The Kisspatent research noted that the list of top blockchain patent holders was not really represented by distributed ledger-specific firms.

“Blockchain-only companies are not filing for patents, Fortune500 companies are,” Kisspatent researcher Dr. D’vorah Graeser notes. Interestingly, the firm Nchain, the infamous company that the self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright works for, is a “the only pure blockchain company.”

Kisspatent highlights that Nchain’s claims are based on numbers said in a press release, but “[the number] could include many that haven’t published yet, plus they may be counting international applications filed in multiple countries as separate patent application filings,” Graeser says.

Graeser’s list seems incomplete as it does not include firms like Reechain, Webank, and Tencent. Chinadaily.com shows that these three Chinese firms are top blockchain patent holders.

According to the regional publication’s estimates, IBM has 240 blockchain patents, Rechain 279, Webank 282, and Nchain has 402 patents total. Chinadaily.com’s list shows Tencent has a significant number of distributed ledger patents with 724 to-date. Alibaba Group is still king with a whopping 1,505 blockchain patent filings.

Key Takeaways SushiSwap popularized fair launches, causing forks of nearly every significant DeFi protocol to emerge.

Fair launches are a flawed concept and can severely erode development incentives in DeFi and crypto.

Putting in a few weeks of work on a fork versus years of effort into building something new has a lopsided reward and risk.

If DeFi investors pursue short-term opportunities and ignore long-term value accretion, the space could find itself in serious trouble.

Fair launches are now the hottest trend in DeFi, but poorly aligned incentives may mean the industry trades true innovation with short-term gains.

Fair for Who?

It’s hard to believe SushiSwap launched less than a month ago. The Uniswap fork had an accelerated boom-bust cycle with copious amounts of controversy, drama, and twists.

But the greatest impact of SushiSwap was popularizing the concept of “fair launches.

Uniswap raising $11 million from eminent VC funds didn’t sit well with the community. Specific individuals believed in the spirit of decentralization, indicating that all protocols should adhere to a broad public distribution of tokens.

Community members were drawn to SushiSwap because 90% of all tokens would be given to liquidity providers (LPs). These same people harbored disdain for Uniswap because the team raised capital and put off a token launch.

Their reasoning was simple: Uniswap was being greedy by refusing to issue a token.

A token would allow DeFi community members to share in the protocol’s upside. Others argued that it would have been greedy to ask the team that built Uniswap from scratch and bootstrapped it into a potential Coinbase-killer to give up their share in the upside.

In the end, Uniswap was redeemed on two levels.

First, SushiSwap’s “developer fund” ended up becoming Chef Nomi’s (SushiSwap creator) personal retirement fund. If it weren’t for widespread anger and a potential doxxing, the pseudonymous creator would’ve walked away with funds earmarked to improve SushiSwap.

Second, Uniswap eventually did launch a token – and the distribution was fairer than most blue-chip DeFi protocols.

Still, fair launches, as they are currently defined, will be the death of development incentives.

If a person can make $14 million in a week just by forking two years of someone else’s hard work, why would any developer buckle down and build something fresh?

he Reality of Fair Launches

There are, of course, fair launch outliers. Cream Finance appears to be one such exception. The project is a fork of Compound but has somewhat established itself through new features.

Cream has lending and borrowing for more assets than Compound, implemented a new interest rate model, and gives fees earned by the protocol back to users (Compound doesn’t). This kind of fork makes sense. Though it leverages Compound’s base code, it adds new functionality to it.

But the majority of fair launches have a single goal in mind: make more money off investors’ greed. Crypto is undeniably in a bull market, and this has many users hunting big profits rather than true innovation.

The darkest side of fair launches, however, is the effect they could have on developers.

Imagine the founder of a new, cutting edge DeFi protocol. They’ve spent the last two years of their lives pouring blood, sweat, and tears into their product. In the name of decentralization and transparency, the founder makes all of the code open source.

On the token front, they issue 60% of tokens to the community through liquidity mining rewards. The founder sells 20% of their tokens to a group of investors to fund the hiring of employees and expenses for development, testing, auditing, marketing, and operations. The rest of the tokens are then distributed amongst the founder and the core team.

A month after the mainnet launch, operations are running smoothly. That is until an anonymous Internet character forks the protocol. Moreover, they say that giving the community a mere 60% is unfair. Instead, their fork will issue 95% of all tokens to the community while keeping 3% in the treasury and 2% for themselves.

The community hails the anonymous character as a harbinger of “true” decentralization for their perceived lack of greed. What some people seem to miss is that 2% of the tokens for forking code and playing a marketing game is not the same as pouring years of one’s life into something trailblazing and keeping a 20% reward.

At a $50 million market cap, that’s either $1 million for a week’s work versus $10 million for years of work. Not to mention, that $10 million doesn’t include the expenses incurred by the founder to get the project up and running.

Innovation Costs More than Money

Fair launches are a message that founders shouldn’t raise money from investors to bootstrap operations, because, for some reason, that’s unfair.

There’s nothing wrong with forking a protocol and building a new design into it. At the very least, that helps test a new version of the same protocol in the marketplace to gauge demand for such a service.

But forking a protocol and making no changes beyond a larger allocation for the public serves little purpose other than making a handful of users a bit richer.

If DeFi users turn to these so-called fair launches to make a quick buck, it could result in a mass exodus of developers from the ecosystem. And without the builders, the DeFi industry will have a much bigger problem moving forward.

The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) has updated its guidance notes for distributed ledger technology (DLT) providers to include recommendations for risk management, as well as clarify aspects around the issuance of digital assets.

In a statement released on September 17, the regulator said the new updates are part of an ongoing effort to adapt its regulatory framework to include the latest Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for virtual asset service providers.

Gibraltar, which has been criticized by the European Union for not doing enough to curb money laundering in the past, particularly in its DLT rules, describes the update as a “natural evolution of the defined regulatory principles.”

According to the GRSC, the guidance notes update the risk framework to “distinguish between virtual assets and virtual asset denominated instruments that are generally classified as higher risk and require additional factors or onboarding tests to be considered.”

Amendments to new token issuances prevent DLT providers from utilizing internally generated token reserves as part of its regulatory capital requirements. In total, the regulator has updated seven out of the nine guiding principles supporting the existing framework, launched in 2018.

Gibraltar’s Minister for Digital and Financial Services, Albert Isola, commented:

Prospective licensees must demonstrate a clear appreciation of the nine core principles underpinning the regulatory framework, covering areas such as corporate governance, capital adequacy, risk management, customer care, and in due course, market manipulation. Other essential prerequisites include thorough internal risk management strategies, robust corporate governance structures, and well-defined protocols, with secure checks in place to ensure the protection of clients’ assets is prioritised.

Currently, 13 DLT providers are licensed under the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, including international platforms Etoro, Huobi, Xapo, and Bitso.

In a Sept. 20 tweet, the business intelligence company’s CEO stated that he considers Bitcoin (BTC) to be a crypto asset network, unlike tokens like Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins, which he referred to as “crypto-application networks.”

Posting a chart from analytics site Bitcoin Dominance, the CEO claimed that the coin’s dominance “has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today.”

When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like #Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins.

However, Saylor is intentionally selective when it comes to this data. Bitcoin Dominance’s figures do not include initial coin offerings or stablecoins, but rather “only includes coins using proof-of-work that are attempting to be money.”

According to CoinMarketCap, which takes stablecoins like Tether (USDT) into account, Bitcoin’s dominance was at a yearly low of 56.67% as of Sept. 13, while Messari shows the metric closer to 59%. Both are far from the 93% dominance Saylor tweeted. Ethereum and DeFi have been driving alt season this year, as the 10 largest DeFi tokens now represent a market cap of roughly $9 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $200 billion.

Though initially claiming “Bitcoin’s days are numbered” in 2013, Saylor has turned bullish on the crypto asset in recent weeks following MicroStrategy’s purchase of $250 million worth of BTC as a reserve currency in August. He announced on Sept. 14 that the firm subsequently bought an additional $175 million of BTC.

“Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value.”

Saylor isn’t alone in the crypto community in discounting the vast majority of altcoins. Emin Gün Sirer, the creator of the first proof-of-work-based crypto, said in April that Bitcoin maximalists are correct to label “95% of the things out there as scams.”

“They’ve just recycled something that belongs to someone else,” he said.",,https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/crypto-market-forecast-w-c-21-september-2020,,,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-neo-xmr-ada-link,"The total crypto market capitalization has recovered from the Sep. 6 lows near $314 billion but it is struggling to sustain above the $350 billion mark, which shows that higher levels continue to attract sellers.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance fell from above 68% in mid-May to about 56% in the first half of this month as DeFi tokens embarked on a strong bull run.

However, in the past few days, the DeFi assets have witnessed sharp corrections and their volatility has increased. This could possibly shift traders’ attention back to Bitcoin. It’s also possible that Bitcoin’s inability to hold above the $11,000 level could also be negatively weighing on the confidence of altcoin and DeFi-token traders.

Although Bitcoin has been struggling to find momentum, a positive is that the volume of Bitcoin futures trading on Bakkt has been increasing and the exchange whale ratio is near yearly lows. This suggests accumulation by the whales and institutional traders.

Currently, most major cryptocurrencies are not following a general trend as the price action has been mostly coin specific. This has opened up opportunities both on the short side and the long side. Hence, in today’s list, two short ideas have been discussed for the traders who are bearish on the crypto markets.

BTC/USD

The relief rally in Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $11,147.60. This shows that the bears have used the current relief rally to initiate short positions.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line and the $10,625 support, it will signal weakness. If the BTC/USD pair sustains below $10,625, it will increase the possibility of a retest of $9,835.

However, if the pair rebounds off the $10,625 support sharply, this will be the first sign that the correction might be over. Trading momentum is likely to pick up after the rally breaks above the downtrend line.

If the price closes (UTC time) above the downtrend line, the possibility of a rally to $12,460 increases. Even though there is resistance at $12,000 it seems likely that it will be crossed.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The pair is currently attempting to rebound off the uptrend line, which suggests that the bulls purchased the dip to this support. The buyers will now make one more attempt to push the price above the $11,147.60 resistance.

If the bounce fizzles out and the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line, a drop to $10,625 could occur. This is an important support for the bulls because selling is likely to intensify if this level breaks down.

If the pair rebounds off $10,625, a few days of range-bound action is possible. The flattening moving average on the 4-hour chart suggests a balance between supply and demand.

NEO/USD

NEO is currently facing stiff resistance at $25.23, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. However, as it is in an uptrend, traders are likely to view the dips as a buying opportunity.

NEO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The immediate support on the downside is at $23 and below that at the 10-day simple moving average ($22.26). If the NEO/USD pair rebounds off either support, it will indicate that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy which is a positive sign.

If the bulls can push the price above the $25.23–$25.78923 resistance zone, the uptrend is likely to resume. The next target on the upside is $29.

A break below the 10-day SMA will be the first sign that the momentum is weakening and a drop below $20.9633 will signal a possible change in trend.

NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls pushed the price above the $25.23 resistance twice but they could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that the bears are attempting to stall the rally at this resistance.

However, on the downside, the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below $23, which shows that the buyers are accumulating on every minor dip.

This could keep the pair stuck between $23 and $25.50 for a few more days. The moving averages have flattened out, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.

XMR/USD

The recovery in Monero (XMR) from the Sep. 5 low of $74.1012 has been strong and the bulls have pushed the price back above the moving averages, which increases the possibility that the correction might be over.

XMR/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a stiff fight at the $97.4615 resistance. If the XMR/USD pair turns down sharply from the current levels and breaks below $84, a drop to $74.1012 is possible.

Conversely, if the bulls can arrest the next dip at the 20-day exponential moving average ($89), it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $97.4615. Above this resistance, a move to $105.9131–$107.3742 is possible. A break above $107.3742 can result in a rally to $120.

XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the recovery from $74.1012 has been gradual. Although the bears broke the pair below the 30-EMA on several occasions, they could not capitalize on it and intensify the selling.

This shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips. Currently, the price has again dipped back below the 30-EMA. If the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try and drive the price above the overhead resistance at $97.4615.

The short-term momentum is likely to weaken if the bears can break and sustain the price below the immediate support at $87.5629.

ADA/USD

The relief rally in Cardano (ADA) from the lows of $0.0855982 on Sep. 6 hit a stiff resistance at $0.0997444 on Sep. 13. The moving averages are sloping down, which suggests that the bears are in command.

ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

In a downtrend, the bears short on pullbacks to resistance levels as that improves the risk to reward ratio of the trade. Currently, if the bears can sink the ADA/USD pair below the $0.0855982 support, the decline might resume.

Traders can consider taking positions on the short side with an appropriate stop-loss to benefit from the likely down move. The next support on the downside is at $0.074 but if this support fails to hold, the drop can extend to $0.05.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off $0.0855982 and the bulls drive the price above $0.10. Such a move will suggest that the downtrend might be over.

However, it is not necessary that a new uptrend starts as soon as a downtrend ends because many times, the price remains range-bound as it tries to form a bottom.

Therefore, traders can step aside and wait for a new bullish setup to form if the price breaks above $0.10.

ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has been gradually declining towards the critical support at $0.0855982 and a close (UTC time) below this level is likely to start the next leg of the down move.

However, if the pair rebounds off $0.0855982, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above $0.10. If they succeed, a quick relief rally is possible.

Conversely, if the price again turns down from $0.10, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) is in a downtrend and it has been making a lower high and a lower low pattern for the past few days, which shows that the bears are using the relief rallies to sell.

LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The down sloping moving averages suggest that the trend favors the bears. If they can sink the LINK/USD pair below $9.65, a drop to $9 is likely. This is an important support to watch out for because a break below this level is likely to resume the downtrend.

The next support on the downside is $7. Therefore, traders can consider benefiting from the possible down-move.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair turns up from the current levels or rebounds off sharply from the $9 levels and breaks above the downtrend line.

LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

On Sep. 5 and 6, the bears were unable to sustain the price below $10.50, which shows that the bulls were attempting to defend this level.

However, during the current fall, the price has been sustaining below $10.50 for the past two days, which suggests that the buying has dried up.

The moving averages are sloping down gradually and the price is below the averages, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears.

A break above the 30-EMA will be the first sign that the bears are losing their grip. Until then, the path of least resistance is to the downside.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/78279/bitflyer-europe-paypal-integration,"Crypto exchange bitFlyer Europe has announced an integration with PayPal.

The move means bitFlyer users can now deposit euros using their PayPal accounts to buy cryptocurrencies. ""What we have done is that we have integrated PayPal in the same way e-commerce websites would,"" Jacek Bastin, business strategy manager at bitFlyer Europe, told The Block. ""The integration is all about removing barriers to entry.""

Indeed, PayPal is a dominant payment method in Europe, with about 35% market share, said Bastin. ""So that's a clear milestone for us, and enables us to follow our mission to make crypto more accessible for all, especially newcomers,"" he added.

As for how the integration would work in practical terms, bitFlyer Europe users will be redirected to PayPal's website when selecting the payment method to deposit funds. The fund transfers would be ""close to instant,"" said Bastin. Traditional payment methods can take up to three business days for deposits to clear.

""We're proud to offer users the opportunity to use their PayPal accounts to deposit funds for purchasing crypto,"" said Andy Bryant, COO of bitFlyer Europe.

Currently, no crypto exchange allows depositing funds via PayPal accounts. Coinbase, which has a longstanding relationship with PayPal, allows only withdrawals to users' PayPal accounts. The Block has reached out to Coinbase about whether the exchange would also enable deposits via PayPal in the near future, and will update this story should we hear back.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, such as LocalBitcoins and Paxful, allow buying crypto via PayPal, but that is not a direct integration. On these platforms, buyers and sellers transfer funds from and to their PayPal accounts for trades. ""That is a C2C [customer-to-customer] relationship, ours is a B2C [business-to-customer],"" Bastin told The Block.

Brokerage firm eToro also allows buying crypto via PayPal. The option works as a normal PayPal transaction, an eToro spokesperson told The Block, adding that in the U.S., eToro currently only accepts deposits by wire and ACH transfers.

For bitFlyer Europe, PayPal is an intermediary and a bridge between users and the exchange, Bastin told The Block.

bitFlyer Europe was launched in January 2018 and is a fully-owned subsidiary of its Japanese parent bitFlyer. The exchange also operates in the U.S. It currently has about 1.25% market share in terms of trading volumes, according to The Block Research, and is recognized as one of a few exchanges with legitimate volumes.

It is unclear whether PayPal has partnered with more crypto exchanges for similar integrations. Bastin declined to comment and PayPal did not respond to The Block's requests for comment by press time.

PayPal has reportedly been looking to offer a crypto trading service via its app. The payment giant is said to have partnered with Paxos Crypto Brokerage to launch such a service.

In a recent tweet, Crypto Analyst Timothy Peterson of Cane Island Alternative Advisors has predicted that ChainLink (LINK) is on a path towards experiencing returns similar to an early Bitcoin of 300 – 400% per year. According to Mr. Peterson, the price of LINK is very much linked to the adoption of the ChainLink network.

Use of ChainLink’s Price Feeds and Oracles Continues to Grow

Mr. Peterson has constantly used Metcalfe’s Law to highlight the relation between network activity and the value of the associated token. In this case, activity on the ChainLink network continues to grow with multiple crypto projects signing up to use the project’s price feeds.

In this past week alone, several crypto projects have announced their use of ChainLink’s price feeds. To begin with, TrustSwap announced that it will be using ChainLink’s ETH/USD price reference data for its SmartLock and SmartEscrow products.

Other crypto projects that announced the integration of ChainLink technology in the last week include SpectreAI, Matic Network, Zapper, Hacken, XinFin Network, Baseline protocol and Crypto.com.

A Possible Bottom for ChainLink in Late September

In terms of the short term value of ChainLink in the crypto markets, Timothy Peterson has suggested that late September could be a possible time-frame for LINK to bottom in the crypto markets. He shared his price analysis of ChainLink via the following tweet that also highlighted that its value is tied to unique function calls on the ChainLink network.",,https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-companies-banks-evolving-together,"Some say that meaningful change happens gradually. Others insist it erupts unexpectedly. This week, we saw that both are true.

Earlier this week, the Wyoming Banking Board voted to approve the application from San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken for a Special Purpose Depositary Institution (SPDI) banking charter. Yes, one of the crypto industry’s oldest exchanges has become a bank.

This is a big deal, one that heralds a coming transformation of the crypto asset industry. Market participants and commentators understandably reacted with glee and surprise. Both are warranted, yet both overlook the bigger shift that has been building up for some time, and which will have an even more significant change on how finance functions.

Good news

First, to understand the excitement, let’s look at what this means for Kraken.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

A SPDI is a bank charter, but it is not a traditional bank in that it can’t make loans. It also is not required to have FDIC insurance, since there is no solvency risk stemming from fractional reserve banking – 100% of its deposits have to be backed by assets on hand.

Pending approval, this should give the firm’s subsidiary Kraken Finance access to an account at the Kansas City Federal Reserve, which gives it access to the U.S. payments system. This will make it easier for clients to move funds on and off the exchange, as well as allow for the launch of new products such as debit cards, IRA accounts and wealth management services.

Also, Kraken Finance will be able to custody both fiat and crypto assets, with more oversight and legal protection for clients than a trust company can offer. Client confidence will get a further boost through the additional capital that banks are required to hold, and through the required contingency account.

And, although it is chartered in Wyoming, Kraken Finance will be able to operate in most U.S. states under a unified regulatory framework through reciprocity agreements, possibly even returning to operate in New York, more than five years after its public departure in response to the BitLicense.

This is good for Kraken, but also for the industry as a whole, as it will facilitate onboarding for a range of businesses and institutions that are only comfortable entrusting financial transactions to a bank. It also takes steps towards solving the perennial problem many crypto businesses have in getting a banking license for operational needs. Opening an account at a digital asset bank should support both fiat and crypto liquidity. And the emergence of a competitor to the few banks serving digital asset businesses should give customers greater choice and better conditions.

And finally, Kraken is likely to be the first of many firms moving to take advantage of the business opportunity that being a digital asset bank promises. This will continue to boost institutional confidence in the crypto industry, and support the growth of related banking services that further incorporate digital assets into users’ daily lives.

Unexpected news

Now, let’s look at why this was a surprise.

A group of visionary regulators and advocates started work in 2018 on the painstakingly detailed process of drawing up legislation that takes crypto assets into account. Caitlin Long, one of the aforementioned advocates, hosted a panel at our Invest conference last year that went into many of the details, and has both written and spoken about it at length. So, no surprise there.

And a Kraken job ad in December of last year hinted that applying for the SPDI charter was in its plans. Yet, Kraken’s win in being the first caught many off guard, because Kraken has not traditionally been seen as, well, the type to choose the banking route.

The exchange was founded in 2011 (when the bitcoin price averaged $5.60) by Jesse Powell, one of the industry’s earliest advocates, and an outspoken critic of regulatory overreach. What is one of the original crypto companies doing becoming a bank? Has it given up its principles to join the “system” bitcoin was supposed to circumvent?

The answer is no, it hasn’t. On the one hand, Powell has shown from the beginning that he will take steps to ensure fair access to cryptocurrencies, and has worked at getting strong banking relationships to support his business. Becoming a bank is an efficient way to cement the firm’s standing in the financial community, which benefits its clients.

On the other hand, the “system” that Kraken is joining is changing. And that has been the point all along.

Important news

Here we get a glimpse of the bigger shift I mentioned above. It’s not that crypto businesses are jumping through hoops to become respectable. That is happening to some extent, and it’s good for the industry. Respectability brings mainstream acceptance and investment inflow. And with its SPDI application, Kraken is reinforcing its reputation as one of the more innovative institutions in our sector.

The bigger shift is that traditional finance is changing to adapt to the crypto industry.

The SPDI is a new type of bank charter that was created with the crypto industry in mind. A new set of definitions and protections was drawn up to take into account crypto asset characteristics. A state passed financial legislation for the crypto industry.

What happened this week is not so much confirmation that crypto businesses are joining traditional finance. It’s more, to some extent, the other way around.

Many of us working in this industry are here because we believe that we are witnessing the emergence of a new economic system that will reform capital markets and finance. We have all faced cynics who insist that traditional finance won’t change, that cryptocurrencies are a threat to stability and order and that authorities won’t let this scale of innovation take root.

This week proved the cynics wrong.

The main story is not that one of the original cryptocurrency businesses, which supports the underlying principles of distributed governance, has joined the legacy financial system.

The story is more one of traditional finance adapting.

So far, this is both a small step (Kraken is one company, Wyoming is one state, the U.S. is one country) and a big one. The crypto industry wants reasonable regulation, for security and respectability. But it knows that traditional rules can’t apply. So it has convinced the rule makers to make new ones.

This week it showed that it can get the traditional side to meet it halfway. If you were wondering how the crypto industry could transform traditional finance, this is how it happens.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

Bitcoin started to recover some ground this week, although it is still down for the month.

Stocks generally continue to languish, with the tech sector suffering a drawn-out hangover from recent exuberance. The market as a whole seemed to be feeling frustration that the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks this week – in his last scheduled public appearance before the U.S. election – didn’t offer more clarity on inflation expectations.

Amid deepening fatigue around the persistent uncertainty (not just about inflation but also about the economic recovery, a vaccine, can our kids stay in school and so much more), concern about the fate of the U.S. dollar seems to be gathering strength. Even renowned fund manager Ray Dalio was caught hinting that “other asset classes” will pick up strength from the loss of faith in fiat currencies.

The question remains how long before this growing tension starts to really overrule the persistent faith that the Fed will keep stock markets afloat. The declines we’ve seen so far this month may hint that the concern is starting to make itself felt in the indices – or, they could just be a breather before another spurt of energy.

Be sure to listen to my colleague Nathaniel Whittemore interview Raoul Pal for a harsh take on the inefficacy of monetary policy and the need for a new economic paradigm.

CHAIN LINKS

Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, revealed that his company has acquired an additional $175 million in bitcoin, which brings his firm’s total spend on cryptocurrency to approximately $425 million. TAKEAWAY: While it is exciting to see such public validation coming from outside our industry, it is a bit worrying when corporate treasury decisions start to be treated as publicity for a concept. It’s also disconcerting to see the resulting (or coincidental?) bump in the share price touted as a reason other corporate treasurers should put company funds into cryptocurrencies. I say this as someone who believes in bitcoin’s long-term potential (not investment advice!). I also say this as someone concerned about the pressures CFOs face in their daily jobs, and the implied assumption that putting corporate funds into bitcoin is risk-free. It isn’t.

(Nathaniel Whittemore’s interview of Michael Saylor is a compelling listen.)

Over $1 billion worth of bitcoin has been tokenized on Ethereum, equivalent to 0.42% of the total BTC supply and up from less than $7 million in January. TAKEAWAY: This is astonishing growth. The concept is compelling. It’s not just about depositing your bitcoin into a specific wallet in order to get a corresponding amount of an Ethereum-based token that you can then deposit in another wallet to get yield. It’s also fascinating for the way assets can “live” on more than one blockchain at once, even if just temporarily. We’ll no doubt be hearing a lot more about this.

The RGB protocol, currently in beta, is a second layer network that aims to bring smart contracts and tokenized assets to Bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: This reminds us that Bitcoin may have a simple and resilient protocol, but it is also an evolving technology. While the base code may be difficult to change, developers are working on code layers that connect to the Bitcoin blockchain and that allow for additional functionalities. Some of these may one day end up being a key driver for bitcoin demand, much like the growing demand for applications on the Ethereum blockchain was one of the factors that boosted the price of its native token, ETH.

A leaked version of rules to be issued later this month by the European Commission proposes an all-encompassing set of regulations covering the trading or issuance of digital assets, effectively treating them the same as any other regulated financial instrument. TAKEAWAY: The legal clarity will be welcomed by many, although Europe has a well-earned reputation for passing blanket rules with good intentions that end up having the opposite effect than that intended. That said, European regulators have on the whole been supportive of blockchain technology, and some countries have encouraged the development of digital asset market infrastructure, so this could end up being a positive development. Blockchain services firm Diginex is officially merging with publicly traded 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The merger is a key part of its plan for a “backdoor” Nasdaq listing. TAKEAWAY: Diginex’s businesses include crypto derivatives exchange EQUOS.io, digital asset trading technology platform Diginex Access, securitization advisory firm Diginex Capital, as well as a digital asset custody provider and an investment management business. Some see irony, as it represents the merging of decentralized assets with centralized markets (a crypto company listing on Nasdaq). Others see perfect synergy, however, as Diginex covers a range of crypto-focused businesses that are pushing the innovation envelope for capital markets. Either way, it heralds the eventual merging of decentralized and centralized concepts, and a maturation of crypto market infrastructure.

According to blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, the number of “young investment” wallets (those that are one to three months old and rarely send bitcoins) has jumped to the highest level since February 2018, double that of six months ago. TAKEAWAY: While it’s hard to draw clear conclusions from address data, this does hint at growth in interest in cryptocurrency from new entrants into the market. The theory is that new addresses used for transactional purposes would have outgoing as well as incoming transactions – those that are almost all incoming are more likely to be investment accounts.

According to a report in Bloomberg, India plans to ban trading in cryptocurrencies. TAKEAWAY: So, India has been sending mixed signals. It allows banks to offer services to crypto exchanges. And then leaks a possible ban on crypto exchange activity? This is worth watching because India is a potentially massive market. Even apart from the sheer size of the population, there’s the recent painful experience with demonetization and the relatively high inflation rate.

Leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit is seeing increasing investor interest in bitcoin options that would profit from prices rallying as high as $36,000 by the end of 2020. TAKEAWAY: I’d say this is nuts, but it obviously makes sense to some people.

For those looking for more clarity as to what’s going on in crypto market infrastructure, this is your week.

From MTGox to crypto banking

In the early days of Bitcoin, there were no rules, or at least none that people understood. The first batch of companies were focused entirely on functionality; Simply making things possible that before crypto had been impossible.

In the aftermath of the collapse of first Mt Gox and, later, The DAO, it became obvious that rules did apply, or at least would, moving forward. But what wasn’t very clear was how they’d apply as different regulatory bodies claimed authority in confusing and often conflicting ways.

As law, if not order, came to the industry, much of crypto’s first wave of U.S.-based exchanges were crushed as they struggled to get legal, a challenging task with different rules and unique compliance burdens for each state and territory in which they’d operate. New York famously introduced the BitLicense, which in the five years since its introduction has approved just 25 companies to operate in the U.S. financial hub.",2020-09-20 12:00:00+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/09/20/bitcoin-revving-up-for-fresh-breakout-says-crypto-analyst-josh-rager-heres-what-to-watch/,"Crypto trader and analyst Josh Rager believes that Bitcoin is revving up for a fresh breakout to kick off the next leg of the bull market.

In a BlockRoots video, Rager offers his bullish and bearish scenarios for the number one cryptocurrency.

“For me, I not only want Bitcoin to break up here ($11,100) but I want to see it break up above $11,245 and make its way up from there…

Now, I don’t want to see it break down below $10,600 and really there’s a couple of reasons why. One, in particular, in the lower timeframe, is because this area was basically the resistance before.

So, of course, if we break down here and we don’t bounce and we come back down, then we’re going to be back in this entire range right here ($9,800 – $10,600) and that’s not a good thing.

I would expect us to continue to move on down from there if Bitcoin does break back below $10,600.”

The crypto strategist also emphasizes that Bitcoin has managed to put together a meaningful bounce after dropping nearly 20% from this year’s high of about $12,250. From the long-term timeframe, Rager believes Bitcoin will reestablish its bullish tone once it recovers a key level.

“To reclaim this area of $11,100 that even on the weekly chart acted as support, to reclaim that and move on up, hopefully break back above this area above $11,520, to break above there and then continue on up…. That’s going to be super important but probably most of all, we definitely want to see price stay above this area that held us down for so long and that area is actually $10,500 – $10,600.”

Leading cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer has announced an integration with global payments platform PayPal.

The integration means that PayPal’s millions of European users can now deposit funds to the bitFlyer Europe platform to buy cryptocurrencies safely and securely. The integration is the latest step by bitFlyer to deliver on their mission of making cryptocurrency trading safer and more accessible globally, and to support and protect users who may be new to cryptocurrency as well as more experienced traders.

Andy Bryant, COO of bitFlyer Europe, said, “We’re proud to offer users the opportunity to use their PayPal accounts to deposit funds for purchasing crypto. The integration of PayPal adds a new funding source for bitFlyer users. Thousands of bitFlyer users already use PayPal for fiat transactions. Now, users can purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the same way too.”

The integration provides bitFlyer users with an alternative to the traditional deposit payment methods currently accessible via the bitFlyer Europe trading platform, including wire transfers. Traditional payment methods can often take up to three business days for deposits to clear. With PayPal, deposits are typically nearly instant.

Jacek Bastin, Business Strategy Manager at bitFlyer Europe, added: ""The cryptocurrency space is still in its infancy, and despite the ecosystem growing, the industry is still daunting for newcomers. Given that approximately a third of European e-commerce payments are being processed through PayPal, we are more than thrilled to provide users with a deposit method they know and rely upon. The process to deposit through PayPal is entirely frictionless, secure and reliable, with users to be credited near to instantly"".

bitFlyer Europe launched in January 2018 as a fully owned subsidiary of bitFlyer, Inc., a household name in the cryptocurrency space in Japan, and one of the longest-standing cryptocurrency exchanges. bitFlyer is the only cryptocurrency exchange that is regulated in Japan, the US and Europe combined, and has also been recognised as one of only 10 exchanges that isn’t faking trading volumes.



",2020-09-21 09:42:00,https://www.coindesk.com/occ-banks-can-hold-some-stablecoin-reserves,"The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has published fresh guidance, officially clarifying national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.

The OCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published stablecoin guidance Monday, providing the first detailed national guidance on how cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies should be treated under law. Prior to Monday’s notices, there was no federal clarity around stablecoins.

Stablecoin issuers have been using U.S. banks for years, but in an unclear regulatory environment. Now, the OCC wants federally regulated banks to feel comfortable providing services to stablecoin issuers, it said in a press release. An accompanying interpretative letter, signed by Senior Deputy Comptroller Jonathan Gould, explained that while banks should conduct due diligence and ensure they assess the risks of banking any stablecoin issuers, stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The letter specifies it refers to stablecoins backed on a one-to-one basis by fiat currencies.

“National banks and federal savings associations currently engage in stablecoin related activities involving billions of dollars each day. This opinion provides greater regulatory certainty for banks within the federal banking system to provide those client services in a safe and sound manner,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks said in a statement.

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of CENTRE member Circle, told CoinDesk in March that at present, USDC issuers have to onboard with reserve banks, with each member holding an account at these banks.

“I can’t speak on behalf of other stablecoins but at CENTRE we’ve seen really robust demand from significant banking institutions to get involved in reserve banking stablecoin clients,” he said at the time.

Banking stablecoins

The OCC detailed how banks should handle stablecoin reserves, specifically referring to stablecoins backed by currencies like the dollar.

The OCC has taken a number of steps to integrate the crypto space with the existing financial system under Brooks, who is Coinbase’s former general counsel. In recent months, the OCC has told banks they can provide services to crypto startups and floated a national payment charter for exchanges and other fintech firms.

According to the letter, stablecoin issuers can point to the fact that regulated banks hold their reserves to convince the general public that they are safe.

The letter specifies that the OCC’s guidance only refers to stablecoins held in hosted wallets, meaning wallets controlled by a trusted third party. Unhosted wallets, which are controlled by the individual user who owns the cryptos being stored, are not included in Monday’s announcement.

“The due diligence process should facilitate an understanding of the risks of cryptocurrency and include a review for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering,” the OCC’s interpretative letter said.

This due diligence includes Patriot Act compliance as well.

“Stablecoin reserve accounts could be structured as either deposits of the stablecoin issuer or as deposits of the individual stablecoin holder if the requirements for pass through insurance are met,” the letter explained.

SEC response

Further, the SEC said certain stablecoins might not be securities under federal law, but advised issuers to work with the agency and legal counsel to ensure this is the case. According to the statement, the SEC is willing to publish a “no-action” letter, which would assure the recipient that the regulator would not bring an enforcement action against the company.

“Whether a particular digital asset, including a so-called “stablecoin,” is a security under the federal securities laws is inherently a facts and circumstances determination. This determination requires a careful analysis of the nature of the instrument, including the rights it purports to convey, and how it is offered and sold,” the SEC said.

Monday’s statements would appear to apply to fiat-backed stablecoins only, not algorithmic ones. Basis, a stablecoin startup which raised $133 million in 2018, shut down that December after its lawyers concluded that the specific mechanism for its token would be treated as securities under U.S. law.

The SEC’s crypto czar, Valerie Sczcepanik, said as much during last year’s SXSW.

“You might be getting into the land of security” with algorithmic stablecoins, she said in March 2019.

The SEC said Monday that it recommended issuers contact FinHub, its fintech wing, to ensure projects remain in compliance.

“The Staff stands ready to engage with market participants to assist them and to consider providing, if appropriate, a ‘no-action’ position regarding whether activities with respect to a specific digital asset may invoke the application of the federal securities laws,” the SEC said.",2020-09-21 20:02:03+00:00,https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-exchange-kraken-wyoming-banking-license/585514/,"The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken last week obtained a special-purpose depository institution license from Wyoming to become the first licensed bank to provide deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.

The move marks a new chapter in the exchange's search for an agreeable license. Kraken pulled out of New York in 2015, after executives saw the state's BitLicense as too invasive.

With the new setup, Kraken will maintain its headquarters in San Francisco, but a subsidiary, Kraken Financial, will be based in Cheyenne and act as a bridge between digital assets and fiat currency. The license will help Kraken reduce its dependence on third-party financial institutions.

By being on the cutting edge of government regulatory participation in crytpo-blockchain finance, Wyoming can perhaps position itself as a top jurisdiction for fast-growing crypto players. Kraken is not alone among crypto firms in seeking to gain regulatory approvals they can tout to consumers.

""Wyoming is a rare and shining example of how thoughtful regulation can drive innovation for fintech companies,"" said David Kinitsky, Kraken Financial's CEO.

Deposits won't be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), so Kraken will be required to maintain 100% reserves against all deposits. However, the FDIC typically only insures deposits up to $250,000. If Kraken were to deal only with big depositors, the point of an FDIC backstop would be moot.

For now, Kraken will only offer accounts to U.S. residents, but the exchange plans to expand to a global clientele. The company said it would offer digital asset custody, demand/deposit accounts, and wire transfer and funding services in its first year but plans a suite of mobile and online banking products, a debit card and other functions.

A bit of a serial acquirer, Kraken has bought 10 companies so far. The excahnge has had one funding round, a crowdfunding offering that has raised $118.5 million, according to Crunchbase. Founder Jesse Powell was quite public in late 2018 about floating more equity that he said would value the company at $4 billion, but so far that financing, much less the valuation, has not been announced.",2020-09-21 05:14:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/arsenal-fc-agrees-betting-partnership-with-crypto-led-sportsbet-io/,"Coingaming Group’s cryptocurrency sportsbook, Sportsbet.io has been unveiled as the official betting and gaming partner of English Premier football club, Arsenal.

The new deal comes barely a few weeks after Sportsbet.io secured a similar sponsorship deal with English top-flight soccer outfit, Southampton. The sports betting firm has been selected as the club’s new main partner and front-of-shirt sponsor for the 2020/21 season.

The Federal Reserve, which has already printed about $3 trillion of new money this year, is now explicitly devoted to reducing the dollar’s purchasing power in a bid to revive the economy. Higher inflation also typically happens when a country gets laden with debt and interest rates are cut to zero, as is now the case in the U.S.

“We’re at a moment where you may see some inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said last week.

The trend could be good for bitcoin, which many crypto investors believe can serve as a hedge against inflation, a digital and perhaps more portable alternative to gold. As detailed last week by SeekingAlpha contributor Lyn Alden, the trend has been clear since roughly 1980, when the share of wealth held by the world’s richest 0.1% of people began a decades-long rise from about 5% to more than 20%.

But increasingly, it looks like bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge might be the cryptocurrency’s most compelling investment narrative, and not necessarily as the dominant digital asset for perpetuity, as many so-called bitcoin maximalists have argued.

Last week, bitcoin’s “dominance” – the market value of all bitcoins in existence, divided by the market value of all digital assets – fell to 57%, from 68% at the start of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.

The primary challenger, of course, is ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which has exploded with activity this year as the primary venue for the fast-growing realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Ether’s market value has climbed to about 12% of the industry total, from about 6.8% at the start of the year.

“The rivalry between Bitcoin ‘maximalists’ and Ethereum enthusiasts has become more polarized in recent months, with each side latching on to narratives that best support the asset to which they have pledged their allegiance,” Kevin Kelly, co-founder of the market-analysis firm Delphi Digital, wrote this month in report. And recently, Ethereum has been “playing catch-up to its ‘digital gold’ counterpart.”

Bitcoin is again taking cues from traditional markets.

The leading cryptocurrency is dropping alongside stocks, with soaring coronavirus cases across Europe and other parts of the world threatening to snuff out the nascent global economic recovery.

Bitcoin is currently down over 2% at $10,650 and may suffer a more significant drop if the risk aversion worsens, boosting demand for the safe-haven U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency tanked 40% on March 12 as the global stocks’ coronavirus-induced crash triggered a global dash for cash.

The recent rise in the outflow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges could add to bearish pressures around bitcoin.

On Sunday, 784 BTC were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets – significantly higher than the 30-day average daily outflow of 265 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Tweet of the Day",2020-09-21 13:36:54+00:00,https://www.institutionalassetmanager.co.uk/2020/09/21/289856/institutional-investors-increase-allocations-crypto-assets-says-new-survey,"New research amongst institutional investors who collectively help manage USD78.4 billion of assets, reveals that over the next five years 26 per cent believe pension funds, insurers, family offices and sovereign wealth funds will ‘dramatically’ increase their level of investment in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and crypto assets in general.

A further 64 per cent anticipate a slight rise. The corresponding figure for hedge funds is 32 per cent and 48 per cent respectively.

The findings are from crypto asset issuance company Evertas, which focuses on covering institutional holders of cryptoassets including exchanges, custodians, traditional financial institutions, funds, family offices and ultra-high net worth individuals.



When asked why they believe institutional investors will increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, 84 per cent of the survey respondents said it was because they expect the regulatory infrastructure for the market to improve, and this is followed by 80 per cent who say it is because the crypto market will become much bigger, providing greater liquidity. Three in four (76 per cent) say it is because they expect more mainstream fund managers and financial services companies to enter this market, and there will be more funds and investment vehicles in this area to choose from.



However, Evertas’ findings reveal that institutional investors still have some substantial concerns about investing in crypto assets. Some 56 per cent said they are ‘very concerned’ about the lack of insurance cover for crypto assets, while 54 per cent were ‘very concerned’ about the working practices and compliance procedures of companies working in the sector who supply services to institutional investors. Other concerns include the quality of custodial services in this market, the availability and quality of trading desks, and reporting facilities.



J Gdanski, CEO and Founder of Evertas, says: “Our research shows that institutional investors are enthusiastic about increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies and crypto assets in general, but there are clearly many issues regarding the infrastructure that supports these markets that still concerns them. These clearly need to be addressed if the full potential of investment from institutional investors in crypto assets is to be realised.”



Raymond Zenkich, President and COO, Evertas, says: “A lack of adequate insurance for the crypto assets market is clearly top of the list of concerns for many institutional investors, which is perhaps not surprising when insurers are only providing capacity of around USD2 billion for a market that is worth between USD250 billion and USD300 million. We are working closely with the insurance community to address this issue.”



Earlier this year, Evertas completed a Seed Stage funding round and raised USD2.8 million. The funding round was led by Morgan Creek, who were joined by Plug n Play, Kailash Ventures, RenGen, Vy Capital and Wavemaker Genesis.

Taking the form of wrapped or tokenized bitcoin, the digital asset takes the best of both blockchains – bitcoin’s price value and brand along with Ethereum’s programmability – into one highly in-demand token.

Last week alone, the supply of BitGo’s wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) topped 76,000 after setting an all-time record of nearly 21,000 wrapped bitcoins minted within one week.

The week before held the previous record of over 12,200 tokens minted in a single week, according to Dune Analytics.

Overall, investors have made tokenized bitcoin one of the largest assets on DeFi with nearly 107,000 BTC worth some $1.1 billion minted from seven issuers, mostly lured in by high rates of return on lending when compared to other options such as BlockFi.

Why use tokenized bitcoin?

What bitcoin on Ethereum does is simple: It provides liquidity for growing decentralized exchanges (DEX), such as Uniswap. Bitcoin’s current market cap is five times larger than the second largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), according to The CoinDesk 20. That money can be put to use making more money.

Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks.

DeFi is considered vastly immature when compared to traditional or centralized exchange (CEX) markets. This can be seen in the large price spreads between orders on exchange books between different DeFi markets.

Price differences on markets can be exploited by traders in what is called arbitrage opportunities.

Wrapped bitcoin is often the asset of choice for investors seeking arbitrage. Bitcoin packs a large punch in terms of price value. More money on DeFi trading platforms makes the markets themselves stronger as additional buying and selling options are presented.

But tokenizing bitcoin isn’t without risks, particularly software risk. Investors who want exposure to bitcoin’s liquidity pay higher interest rates to cover the risk of losing an asset in addition to getting exposure to the first cryptocurrencies liquidity.

How this works in practice has taken on a few different forms.

Security of bitcoin investments

Different tokenizing models represent different security assumptions for investor funds.

For tokenized bitcoin, security boils down to the type of custodianship and if the investment is collateralized. Three major models exist: a centralized firm like BitGo; a smart contract system with collateral, such as tBTC; or a complete, synthetic-asset backing employed by sBTC.

BitGo’s Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is the breakout star of the last few months with some $808.5 million in circulation, according to Etherscan.

It’s centralized, meaning deposited bitcoin is held by BitGo. Parties wanting WBTC give BTC to BitGo and then receive an ERC-20 token-equivalent of BTC in return. That ERC-20 can then be sold on secondary markets or plugged into a DeFi application to earn yield.

Keep Network’s tBTC, which launched Tuesday, is similar to WBTC but replaces the centralized BitGo model with a network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts. This network aims at bringing more decentralization to BitGo’s process by allowing both parties – the bitcoin depositor and custodian – to interact trustlessly through software.

A few features make this possible, such as the bitcoin depositors being able to choose who holds their bitcoin and a 150% security bond (held in ETH) pledged by the custodians on the off-chance they run to the hills with the deposits.

Ren’s rBTC that makes up about 20% of all wrapped bitcoin in the wild, according to Dune Analytics. It works in a similar manner to tBTC’s node network by having the Ren Virtual Machine, RenVM, act as a trustless agent between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

Lastly, sBTC is an ERC-20 version of bitcoin. But this time it’s backed by another token, the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). Each sBTC is not backed by BTC, but 800% of a BTC’s value in SNX, the token for minting synthetic assets (Syns) on the Synthetix DEX.

An example of how wrapped bitcoin works

Take a recent transaction from Alameda Research (sister firm of the trading platform FTX).

FTX allows users to swap between BTC and WBTC. When users swap bitcoin for wrapped bitcoin, FTX pulls from Alameda’s pool of BTC/WBTC. Users may send BTC to FTX (Alameda) and receive WBTC. When Alameda’s pool of WBTC is exhausted, they replenish it directly with BitGo.

Alameda is a merchant and part of the WBTC decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning it can initiate mints for new WBTC using BTC. They send BTC to BitGo and create a minting request on the Ethereum chain as a merchant.

BitGo validates the BTC has been deposited to a preminted address and approves a mint of the number of WBTC equal to Alameda’s request. The WBTC can then be used on FTX or swapped with another token atomically (meaning via a peer-to-peer exchange) or even within a DeFi market.

To redeem, the process is reversed: The buyer will send the WBTC back to the merchant who will then provably burn the tokens.

The future of tokenized assets

The wild success of BitGo’s WBTC and WETH (wrapped ether) may lead to more constructions of other coin holdings. Ben Chan, CTO at WBTC co-creator BitGo, told Coindesk in August that the firm was looking at wrapping other cryptocurrencies.

WBTC’s 2020 success has largely been thanks to DeFi, he said.

“What we’ve seen this year is that WBTC traction has been largely thanks to the highly composable DeFi industry,” Chan said.",2020-09-22 18:31:12+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-great-unbanking-how-defi-is-completing-the-job-bitcoin-started,"In a broad sense, 2020 has been the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. As it toward 1 million deaths and over 30 million infections, governments have been found wanting. Our institutions have crumbled, leaders reacted too slowly, and all of the systems both in place and newly created to protect us — healthcare, aged care, testing, protective equipment supply chains, contact tracing, etc. — have collapsed. But 2020 has also very much been the year of decentralized finance, which has come to be known as DeFi.

DeFi is crypto

To understand why DeFi has captured the imagination of the entire crypto landscape is to understand that it is less about the outrageous returns offered to yield farmers and more about the future possibilities it presents.

Cryptocurrency, and the technology behind it, has always been about future possibilities.

When Bitcoin () was born to little fanfare in 2009, it was quickly recognized by those familiar with it as having the potential to be the future of money. 11 years on, Bitcoin, with its decentralized global system of and miners keeping the network operational and secure, has met its promise and more.

Not only is it a reliable and fast way for people to permissionlessly send money to each other, it has also become a genuine enterprise-grade investment vehicle, and its investment worthiness appears to be growing. it in anticipation of capital growth.

“Bitcoin as an investment vehicle” aside, it remains, in essence, money — a new currency for a new, hyper-connected world.

Bitcoin and/or DeFi

“Bitcoin as money” still works like money insofar as it still relies on a financial ecosystem around it to keep it alive. But that ecosystem is somewhat limited; it consists of those that secure the network on which transactions are transmitted (miners and node operators), wallets, and exchanges where it can be exchanged for other digital and, increasingly, fiat assets.

But a financial services architecture as we know it incorporates a whole lot more in terms of functionality: lending, borrowing, earning interest, paying interest, investing, etc. Bitcoin was never intended to cater to all those mechanisms — but DeFi is.

The next logical step in the evolution of crypto’s gradual assumption of the roles played by traditional finance is being taken by the growing Ethereum-based decentralized finance ecosystem.

DeFi, in many ways, is Bitcoin 2.0. And for that reason, DeFi — although based on Ethereum’s composability and smart contract functionality — furthers the Bitcoin narrative into the future that Bitcoin first allowed us to believe in. With each new DeFi protocol, that future is closing in on us: a world without banks as we have come to know them.

DeFi demonstrates the complementary nature of Ethereum to Bitcoin. By recreating the financial system not from within but from the outside, Ethereum is hosting a movement that completes the circle Bitcoin started.

The vampires aren’t even that bad

Our banking system is as as our COVID-19 response was, but can DeFi actually replace it? The DeFi subsector’s most vocal critics would point to the emergence of SushiSwap, Cream and Yam, along with many others, to suggest the movement resembles more of a circus than a legitimate threat to a giant financial services sector.

Those protocols are considered vampire forks, which are forks of existing protocols, designed to suck liquidity from them. If vampire forks are destructive — and there is no certainty they are — a seminal Rolling Stone article helps put them into perspective. When running through the central role Goldman Sachs played in virtually every financial collapse of the last century, Matt Taibbi called the behemoth:

“The great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.”

DeFi’s vampires probably serve to further the ecosystem by stress-testing it. Legacy finance’s vampires have had only one function: to take money from everyone else to strengthen themselves.

From the Great Depression, to the dot-com bubble and burst, to the housing crisis, the “great vampire squid” had self-serving financial destruction in mind and its tentacles on virtually every lever that produced those catastrophic episodes in our recent economic histories.

The sector as a whole has long since stopped serving most of our needs. Checking accounts no longer pay interest, accessing money costs money, and large enterprises find financing easy, while small and medium enterprises are floundering. Try getting a mortgage as an independent contractor without benefits or job security.

Bitcoin democratized money by freeing us from it in its legacy form. Now, DeFi has captured the imagination of the crypto world as its natural extension — not just the democratization of money but the democratization of finance, promising a seismic shift in the way people bank in the future.

That seismic shift will confer benefits on society we could only have dreamed of a decade ago.

Enter the great unbanking.

tBTC allows a 1-to-1 exchange of Bitcoin for TBTC, which is an ERC-20 token that can be used in Ethereum DeFi apps. According to a statement from Keep, tapping liquidity between Bitcoin and DeFi apps is required for the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency economy. But to do so, the Bitcoin, Ethereum bridge must be safe and reliable, which is what tBTC hopes to provide.

Previously, tBTC had to pause its May launch after the team found a “a significant issue in the redemption flow of deposit contracts was identified that put signer bonds at risk in certain situations,” tBTC said in a statement. Now, one BTC held in reserve fully backs and matches every TBTC token.

tBTC uses a random beacon to select “signers” responsible for depositing BTC so that the company can remain trustless. Those who exchange TBTC to BTC face no intermediary sign-off. Users must perform three steps to mint TBTC on the tbtc.network and track their Bitcoin.

Those behind the project said that tBTC has been the subject of two additional audits following one that took place in March. ""tBTC has been tested rigorously and has undergone an unprecedented three audits. tBTC concluded its first security audit, by ConsenSys, in March. In June, we concluded a second audit by Trail of Bits, and in August we completed a new Bitcoin audit,"" they wrote, writing later:",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-22/ceo-says-bitcoin-is-safer-after-moving-firm-s-cash-to-crypto,"Why did this happen?

Click to skip ahead and see the top 3 cryptocurrency exchanges of 2020.

The last decade has been a great one for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in general. Aside from witnessing the launch of over three thousand new cryptocurrencies, we have also seen an unprecedented increase in the value of these cryptos.

The launch of cryptocurrencies, in general, has led to the development of a plethora of other service apps and companies. One of these service apps is ""Cryptocurrency Exchanges"". Basically, cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms or third-party applications that allow potential crypto investors to either buy, sell, or trade their cryptocurrencies. This exchange could either be from crypto to crypto or from fiat to crypto.

New research from the digital currency insurance firm, Evertas, shows that a surveyed group of investors managing roughly $78 billion in collective assets believes that during the next five years, institutional investors will “dramatically” increase their crypto asset holdings.

This week the crypto asset insurance company Evertas published a cryptocurrency survey that included a number of institutional investors who collectively manage $78 billion in assets. The survey’s participants included ultra-high net worth individuals, custodians, traditional financial institutions, exchanges, funds, and family offices.

The research reveals that 90% of the surveyed respondents believe institutional investors will increase their allocation of digital currencies during the next five years.

The study published by Evertas says that participants said that they had a number of concerns about the investment into crypto assets. Some of which included the quality of trading desks and custodial services within the crypto ecosystem.

The data from the Evertas survey shows 56% of the respondents are “very concerned” about the lack of insurance within the digital currency economy. 54% said they were also “very concerned” about compliance procedures for services who deal with institutional investors.

Interviewees also told a few reasons as to why institutional investors will increase crypto asset exposure. 80% of survey respondents detailed that it was because the market was growing more robust and able to provide “greater liquidity.” 84% said that the increased exposure will be fueled by the improvement of regulatory infrastructure.

“Our research shows that institutional investors are enthusiastic about increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies and crypto assets in general,” J Gdanski, CEO and Founder of Evertas noted after the company published the crypto institutional investment survey.

“There are clearly many issues regarding the infrastructure that supports these markets that still concerns them. These clearly need to be addressed if the full potential of investment from institutional investors in crypto assets is to be realised,” Gdanski added.

According to the Evertas crypto investment survey, the company worked with a market research firm called Pureprofile. Out of the group of institutional respondents who manage billions worth of assets, 25 were based in the United Kingdom and another 25 stemmed from the United States. Evertas also detailed that the survey was conducted during the month of July 2020.

Fresh capital

Crypto projects are raising funds as the industry continues to build out decentralized protocols. Ethereum data firm Dune Analytics, a Github-like platform which provides DeFi insights, has raised $2 million led by Dragonfly Capital and included Multicoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures, DCG and DeFi angels. Meanwhile, Skynet Labs, a startup formerly known as Nebulous, has raised a $3 million funding round led by Paradigm. Using the token-fueled Sia network, Skynet allows for decentralized and permissionless hosting. Recently, community members spun up a Skynet app store following rumors that TikTok might get delisted from popular app stores.

Crypto lobby

It’s been a busy season for crypto lobbyist groups, even amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yesterday, the Blockchain Association announced members from 0x, the Stellar Development Foundation and Kraken will join its board. The new members bring regulatory and DeFi experience to the Washington, D.C.-based association. Elsewhere, former Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce, also based in the U.S. capital. “His experience as a legislator is very very valuable because he can help us navigate Congress,” CDC’s founder Perianne Boring said. The blockchain advocacy group also added Visa, Goldman Sachs and Six Digital Exchange (SDX) have joined the group as executive committee members.

DeFi fund

The cryptocurrency money manager Panxora is raising up to $50 million for a new DeFi-centered hedge fund, CoinDesk reporter Bradley Keoun reports. Based in the Cayman Islands, the fund will primarily buy tokens listed on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges rather than from decentralized – and sometimes community-owned – automated exchanges. Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said few if any decentralized exchanges can guarantee sufficient compliance with anti-money-laundering rules, and also because a token listing from an exchange theoretically implies some level of vetting. The fund is scheduled to start trading on Nov. 2.

Bug fix

DeFi Pulse, the go-to data aggregator for the DeFi scene, said on Twitter late Tuesday night that it had identified and fixed a “previously undetected issue” that led to a substantial misreporting of the total value held on DeFi protocols. The site’s representatives said the TVL (total value locked) in DeFi exceeded a record $13.2 billion on Sept. 18, rather than the $9.1 billion it had previously displayed. Representatives didn’t say explicitly what caused the discrepancy.

Interest earning?

Peer-to-peer commerce company Origin has unveiled a stablecoin that functions like a savings account. Called Origin Dollars, or OUSD, the coin will earn users “interest” from leveraging various DeFi projects without users having to stake in those protocols. Backed one-for-one by the three big stablecoins on Ethereum, Tether’s USDT, Circle and Coinbase’s USDC and MakerDAO’s DAI, Origin Dollars can be minted by depositing those coins onto Origin’s app or bought on Uniswap. On the backend, Origin will take deposits and start yield farming them in different protocols, starting with the DeFi money market Compound. Returns will be driven back into OUSD, minting more OUSD that will be distributed proportionally to all the wallets that have it, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports.

Quick bites

At stake

Tokenized BTC

The number of bitcoins on Ethereum continues to grow, propelled by ballooning volumes in the DeFi space.

CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports the supply of BitGo’s wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) alone topped 76,000 last week, with more than 21,000 entering circulation. Including the other six major issuers, there’s as many as 107,000 BTC (worth ~$1.1 billion) tokenized for use on Ethereum.

This raises questions about why investors or traders would want to tokenize their bitcoin, which adds complexity and potential software risks to their bags.

For many, it appears to be the higher rates of return found on decentralized finance protocols especially when compared to other options such as BlockFi, Foxley notes. “Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks,” he writes.

Skeptics note there really isn’t any bitcoin “on” Ethereum, more of a representation of its value. Others go further in saying that many tokenization options rely on trusting a third party like BitGo to print these representative tokens, thereby adding counterparty and censorship risks to bitcoin.

Recently, though, a trustless alternative, tBTC, relaunched after an abortive first attempt last April.

Market intel

Selloff = slump?

A selloff from bitcoin miners may hint at a weakening market, CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole says. On Tuesday, the net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges (measured by the total change in exchange balances) was 36,800 BTC – the biggest single-day rise since the markets crash on March 13. The uptick in net inflows represents an increase in selling pressure, since investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they see a possible need to liquidate their holdings. This could extend bitcoin’s recent price losses in the short term, with immediate supports at $10,000 and $9,868 (Sept. 8 low).

Internet 2030

Jeff Wilser paints a picture of the coming “currency cold war,” offering three scenarios of how either bitcoin, digital dollars or China’s DCEP will become the dominant world currency, and one where that concept is thrown out the window. The excerpt below is taken from CoinDesk’s “Internet 2030” series about the future of the crypto economy.

SCENARIO FOUR: A non-government-backed cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) gains dominance

What would the internet look like if a private (non-government regulated) currency emerged as dominant? “If you could pay anybody anywhere in the world, instantly and for free, we wouldn’t be so dependent on the advertising model of internet content,” says fintech guru David Birch. Micropayments (such as Brave) might finally emerge from niche to widespread.

“If I can pay 25 cents to read the thing I want to read on The New York Times – I don’t have to subscribe to it and use credit cards – they don’t have to show me disgusting adverts for ear wax, so that’s kind of a win-win,” says Birch. Then again, he acknowledges that this is class-based, as “the rich can buy themselves out of this cesspit.”

Birch also highlights the optimist possibilities, as “If you could do business with anyone in the world, hopefully, new products and services would spring up, to facilitate that trade and interaction.”

International uncertainty may drive cryptocurrency usage. “If we have a stable geopolitical structure, where most people and most nations feel secure, then that will not encourage a large rise of non-government digital currencies,” reasons futurist Ross Dawson.

“Whereas if we have a deep social division and disruption – and civil wars in developed countries in the next decade, that’s very plausible, depending on how you define ‘civil war’ – this will fracture societies and trust in government, and could lead to wholesale shifts to cryptocurrencies.”

With apologies to the crypto super-bulls, this is not necessarily the Lambo Scenario or Moon Scenario. Dawson imagines a potential world of “dueling economies” – even within the United States – if a cryptocurrency emerges dominant. One will be the official legal economy that’s regulated by the U.S. government (like today), and the other an unregulated “shadow economy” that’s dominated by the cryptocurrency.

“There will always be national currencies,” says Dawson. “We’re never going to have a time when the government says, “Okay, we give up, we’re not going to do this anymore.” (He later clarifies that maybe “never” is too strong of a word, but certainly not in the next decade.)

So the question is what’s the balance between the shadow economy and the regulated economy? He points to Italy’s shadow economy as an example, which by some estimates is more than 12% of the nation’s GDP – largely the result of tax evasion.

At least in this scenario, Bitcoin (or some other cryptocurrency) is finally not just a Store of Value or a speculative investment. It could be widely used to buy a cup of coffee, pay your rent, or, yes, to buy your pair of sunglasses.

Unlikely allies

Marty Bent, author of one of the best known daily bitcoin newsletters and host of “Tales From The Crypt” podcast, joins The Breakdown to discuss his latest venture, Great American Mining, an apparently energy-efficient bitcoin mining project. According to Bent, bitcoin mining and big energy are unlikely allies.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-09-23 16:47:42+00:00,https://decrypt.co/42773/billion-bitcoin-options-expire-friday-heres-what-it-means,"In brief Lots of Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts expire on Friday.

It could cause volatility, say some experts.

Equally, nothing could happen. In options contracts, traders are not obliged to buy the asset once the contract expires.

Almost a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin options contracts, a little under half in existence, are set to expire on Friday, per data from Skew analytics. And Ethereum isn’t far behind. About $450 million worth of ETH options contracts expire on the same day.

This could potentially introduce a whole lot of crypto back into the market as traders look to dump or HODL. Here’s what to expect.

What is an options contract?

First things first: What are we talking about?

An options contract lets people buy Bitcoin in the future at a price agreed to beforehand. So, if you entered into an options contract when Bitcoin was worth about $4,000 following the mid-March crash to receive your Bitcoin at that very price come the final Friday of September, that would have been a smart decision (or lucky bet), as Bitcoin has more than doubled in price.

This is also the premise of a Bitcoin futures contract. But where the two differ is that a Bitcoin futures contract creates a contractual obligation to buy that Bitcoin upon the contract’s expiry. With options, traders are not contractually obliged to buy up the Bitcoin but simply have the option to do so.

Back to business

Bitcoin options contracts are big business. On Derebit, the largest platform for options contracts by volume, traders exchange about $57 million worth of options contracts each day. And as of yesterday, there are about $2 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire. That means that about half will expire come Friday. For Ethereum, it’s a similar picture.

So, what will happen? According to a research report from Coin Metrics, for ETH, “this event will likely add additional volatility to price action throughout the week, as traders look to hedge exposure on these positions, work out of them, or possibly take action in the spot market in anticipation.”

For Bitcoin, much the same, Charles Bovaird, a VP of content at crypto research firm Quantum Economics, told Decrypt. “As these contracts approach their expiration date, volatility could spike as investors opt to buy, sell or let their contracts expire.”

Dan Gunsberg, CEO and cofounder of crypto trading platform Hxro, said that a good chunk of the options contracts are between $11,000 and $12,000—far above Bitcoin’s current price of $10,310.

Gunsberg told Decrypt: “The market is effectively giving you 20:1 odds right now that the price will trade at or above $11,000 by the 25th of September.” Hitting $11,000 would be no great explosion; Bitcoin’s price was just above $11,000 on Saturday. But any higher than usual “could set off some fireworks.” Still, he said, “This is crypto, so you never know.”

Bovaird added: “If a large number of contract holders use this ability to purchase bitcoin before the contracts expire, that would place upward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price. Likewise, if contract holders used their options to sell, it would place downward pressure on bitcoin prices,” he said.

“However, it could also have very little impact at all,” he said. “If the options contracts expire without being exercised (used), then they won't place upward or downward price pressure on bitcoin.”",2020-09-23 21:31:09,https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-bitcoin-exchanges-cryptocurrencies-defi-hedge-fund-50-million,"The upcoming U.S. presidential election has become one of the most contentious in history, fraught with searing divisions over everything from the economy to race to the continued health of democracy itself.

So it’s not surprising that Wall Street options traders are now pricing in expectations of elevated market volatility around the November election. Analysts for the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs noted earlier this month that price swings of nearly 3% are implied around election day in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks.

What’s surprising is that options trading on notoriously volatile bitcoin prices, which often trade in sync with stocks, implies a stretch of uncanny calm come November, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported Tuesday.

Godbole writes that ample technical factors might explain the discrepancy, from the influence of certain hedging strategies to the reality that the nascent bitcoin options market is still quite small in relative terms, with most action concentrated in “front-month” contracts that expire in September.

Another possibility, according to Godbole, is that bitcoin, as a globally traded asset, might actually be less susceptible to the U.S. outcome, even though the cryptocurrency is priced in dollars. The implication could be that bitcoin decouples at that point from the U.S. market.

“The U.S. elections will have relatively less impact on bitcoin compared to the U.S. equities,” Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at the digital-asset firm GSR, told Godbole.

Bitcoin's expected volatility over the next few months, as implied by the options market, has been falling. Source: Skew.

Crypto investment firm Panxora seeks $50M for new hedge fund to buy DeFi tokens

There’s been a months-long string of astonishing developments and ridiculous twists in the fast growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Digital tokens with names like YAM and SUSHI have appeared overnight, exploding in value, dominating crypto headlines and sparking serious conversations about the far-reaching potential of digital-asset markets and financial technologies.

With total collateral locked into automated, blockchain-based DeFi trading and lending platforms surging more than 20-fold this year to $13 billion as of last week, big centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and OKEx have rushed to list the tokens and roll out DeFi offerings to avoid missing out.

Now, one cryptocurrency money manager, Panxora, seeks to raise up to $50 million for a new hedge fund to buy digital tokens associated with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

“This has got the potential to really change the way finance is carried out,” Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said in an interview.

In an ironic twist, Panxora’s announcement comes just as the DeFi market appears to be cooling. Just in the past week, total collateral in the systems has declined to about $9.5 billion, according to data tracker DeFi Pulse. Aave, a decentralized lender, saw its LEND tokens fall by 12% during the seven days through Tuesday, according to Messari, a cryptocurrency data firm.

Smith suggests that a correction was bound to come at some point. “We expect the market to be volatile in the early years,” Smith said. “While there is great potential there will inevitably be setbacks along the way.”

Key bitcoin (BTC) on-chain metrics have flipped bearish this week, suggesting the top cryptocurrency by market value may remain under pressure in the short-term.

On Tuesday, the net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges (measured by the total change in exchange balances) was 36,800 BTC – the biggest single-day rise since the markets crash on March 13, according to data source Chainalysis.

“Since Sept. 20, the net daily inflow of bitcoins to exchanges have been increasing and trade intensity has been declining,” Philip Gradwell, an economist at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.

The data point “indicates a weakening market,” he said.

But as soon as the winner is chosen, the “clarity” combined with the asset’s halving has in the past provides “solid” foundation for each new bull run to begin.

Bitcoin Halving In The Past, Fundamentals Build On Bullish Base

Bitcoin’s halving is now months behind us, and its time for the stock-to-flow model to prove itself, or fall victim to lengthening cycle theories.

Thus far, although there’s only been a small sample size to go by, each halving has resulted in a new uptrend. Each Bitcoin halving takes place roughly every four years, reducing the block reward miners receive in BTC, therefore lowering the supply entering the market.

Various tools developed by Bitcoin fundemental expert Charles Edwards indicate that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for another incredible uptrend. His tools, such as the hash ribbons, have provided investors with some of the most profitable buy signals in the asset’s history.

Edwards has turned several crucial network health metrics into technical analysis indicators. In Edwards’ latest chart, although he’s spared the use of those tools, he’s pointing out that although the crypto asset is indeed bullish, the road ahead for the next few months could be “rocky.”

Crypto Bull Run “Clarity” To Arrive Post Presidential Election

According to Edwards, it is the upcoming United States Presidential election that’s to blame for Bitcoin’s rocky stretch ahead.

Past crypto market cycles show that the leading asset by market grows its bullish momentum leading up to the election, then breaks out into “solid” performance afterward.

After the election-related uncertainty and risk is removed from markets, the cryptocurrency rises to a new all-time high. Because Bitcoin has only a short, just over a decade long price history, the sample size for this to occur is small.

But so is the halving. Both the halving, and a Presidential election arrives every four years, and we’ll soon find “clarity” on if history will repeat again, or if because of how pivotal and polarizing this election is, if this time truly is different for Bitcoin.

Following the regulatory sandbox approval by Canadian regulators, Wealthsimple announced that it has launched “Canada’s first regulated crypto platform.” The new crypto exchange is regulated by the federal government as well as regulators in 13 provinces and territories in Canada.

Wealthsimple Crypto Regulated in All Provinces and Territories in Canada

Canadian investment management firm Wealthsimple announced Tuesday that its cryptocurrency exchange has launched. The company explained that Wealthsimple Crypto is “Canada’s first regulated crypto platform” that offers “No minimums or fees for deposits or withdrawals,” elaborating:

Wealthsimple has the first regulated crypto trading platform in Canada … You can now buy and sell bitcoin and ethereum with Wealthsimple Crypto.

The company’s cryptocurrency arm, Wealthsimple Digital Assets Inc. (WDA), received regulatory approval from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) on Aug. 7 to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform. The firm applied for “exemptive relief” in all Canadian jurisdictions as permitted in “CSA Staff Notice 21-327 Guidance on the Application of Securities Legislation to Entities Facilitating the Trading of Crypto Assets.” The CSA comprises securities regulators from each of the 10 provinces and three territories in Canada.

Cryptocurrencies traded on Wealthsimple’s platform are held by Gemini Trust Company, a New York-based regulated crypto custodian with $200 million in cold storage insurance coverage, the company described. After opening a dedicated Wealthsimple Crypto account, users can buy, sell, and hold their cryptocurrencies within the Wealthsimple Trade app which can also be used to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Deposits and withdrawals can only be made in Canadian dollars.

Wealthsimple’s general counsel Blair Wiley detailed:

There are 13 provinces and territories in Canada, and each one regulates us. Plus, we are regulated by the federal government.

In all Canadian jurisdictions other than Québec, WDA is registered as a restricted dealer, whereas it is registered as a derivatives dealer in Québec. With offices in Toronto, New York, and London, Wealthsimple claims to have over 175,000 users worldwide.

In order to qualify, miners will need to meet specific requirements.

An official announcement was first published in the Gaceta Oficial and signed by the head of the SUNACRIP, Joselit Ramirez. It stated that residents in Venezuela who are interested in mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies must request a license and join the so-called ""national pool.”

The legal framework asks people to disclose what kind of activities they would like to do in crypto mining, such as trading, importing, or using mining equipment. The government will also issue a special license for those who want to manufacture ASIC mining hardware or build mining farms.

About the ""national pool,"" the SUNACRIP defined it as follows:

""A group of pooled miners agreeing to share block earnings in proportion to the contributed mining hash power. They share a similar operation to cooperatives, and it would be in charge of the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (SUNACRIP).""

The decree also states that the SUNACRIP ""may"" offer benefits, incentives, and even ""tax exemptions to encourage miners to join the national pool."" However, if Venezuelan crypto miners don't join the national pool, they'll be subject to the Comprehensive Crypto Assets System's sanctions.

The new regulation doesn't clarify if the government has the legal authority to freeze crypto mined within the national pool, or what type of sanctions will be imposed on people who mine outside such a public pool.

Crypto miners should apply for the licenses through the Comprehensive Registry of Services in Cryptoassets, or RISEC, a system run by the SUNACRIP.

Although Venezuela is known for having a highly active crypto mining population, the government has not always favored such activities.

Venezuelan Minister of Habitat and Housing, Ildemaro Villarroel, recently announced that crypto mining operations would not be allowed in any state-owned housing or neighborhoods that are part of the ""Gran Misión Vivienda"" project (Great Home Mission).",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-etf-nasdaq-hashdex/,"Cryptocurrency ETF by Nasdaq and Hashdex Approved to List on Bermuda Stock Exchange

A cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Nasdaq and Brazilian fund manager Hashdex has reportedly been approved to trade on the Bermuda Stock Exchange. Hashdex says the new cryptocurrency investment product tracks the Nasdaq Crypto Index.

Hashdex Says ETF Will Track Nasdaq Crypto Index

Brazilian fund manager Hashdex confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com on Tuesday that the company is launching a cryptocurrency ETF, co-developed with Nasdaq. A Hashdex spokesperson said that the ETF has been approved by the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), elaborating:

The ETF will be available for public trading on BSX once the Nasdaq Crypto Index [NCI] is officially launched.

As for the launch date, “We can’t confirm any dates at this moment. However, it shouldn’t take long. We need the NCI launch first,” the spokesperson emphasized, adding that “Nasdaq will reveal more details about the index methodology once it is launched as well.” At press time, little information has been revealed about this new investment product.

The BSX exchange also independently announced Friday the admission of “Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF Class E Shares” to its official listing. The method of listing, however, is “private placement,” with Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF as the issuer.

According to its listing page on the BSX website, Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF’s “investment objective is to provide investment results that minimize the tracking difference of the performance of the Nasdaq Crypto Index … on a 12-month window.” The index is being co-developed by Hashdex and Nasdaq Inc. The latter will administer and maintain the index on an ongoing basis.

The spokesperson further clarified to news.Bitcoin.com that the upcoming ETF will not be available to American investors, therefore it does not require the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Currently, the U.S. SEC has not approved any bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETF. All proposed rule changes to list and trade bitcoin ETFs have been rejected so far. There are, however, several private investment products, such as Grayscale Investments’ GBTC.

According to its website, the Bermuda Stock Exchange, founded in 1971, is recognized by the U.S. SEC as a Designated Offshore Securities Market under Regulation S; The Financial Services Authority in the U.K. as a Designated Investment Exchange; HM Revenue & Customs in the U.K. as a Recognized Stock Exchange; The Bermuda Monetary Authority as a Recognised Investment Exchange; and as an Approved Stock Exchange under Australia’s Foreign Investment Funds taxation rules.

The ministry now reportedly wants to introduce criminal liability for failure to declare taxes on crypto, including prison terms of up to three years.

According to a Sept. 24 report by Kommersant, the ministry proposes that individuals who fail to report an amount of over 1 million Russian rubles ($13,000) in annual crypto operations should serve a three-year prison term or hard labor.

The ministry also proposed major fines for smaller unreported amounts. As such, any physical or legal entity in Russia would have to report their annual crypto income if its amount exceeds 100,000 rubles ($1,300). Failure to report such amounts are subject to fines of 30% from the total amount of crypto assets held, but no less than 50,000 rubles ($650), the report notes.

The authority also proposes to require local cryptocurrency exchange services to report transactions on taxes every quarter.

According to Kommersant, the new proposals refer to both Russia’s new crypto law “On Digital Assets” and the upcoming bill “On Digital Currency.” In the current version of the law “On Digital Assets,” Russian lawmakers do not provide either taxation rates for crypto, or general rules to report those transactions.

It is not immediately clear what kind of crypto transactions the ministry wants to tax, as the authority only recognizes a few ways to obtain crypto.

In 2018, the 2nd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study estimated the number of identity-verified crypto users at about 35 million globally. As of Q3 2020, there are up to 191 million accounts opened at crypto exchanges — a figure which doesn’t include self-hosted wallets.

The researchers explained the significant increase:

“This 189% increase in users may be explained by both a rise in the number of accounts (which increased by 37%), as well as a greater share of accounts being systematically linked to an individual’s identity, allowing us to increase our estimate of minimum user numbers associated with accounts on each service provider.”

The study also highlights the geolocation of consumers, as crypto firms operating from North America and Europe “report higher user activity, with the median firm indicating that 40% of total users are considered active.” According to the researchers, this figure was much lower for APAC and Latin America-based firms, which reported a rate of 16% and 10% respectively.

The Centre's methodology combined public data and surveys, using a combination of verified user data and the average share of ID-verified accounts surveyed for the study.

Despite researchers' claim that there are limitations to the methodology used in the study, they believe that the published numbers offer “a reliable, approximate figure of the total number of crypto asset holders globally.”",,https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-passes-law-legalizing-crypto-mining-forces-miners-to-join-national-mining-pool/,"Venezuela Passes Law Legalizing Crypto Mining, Forces Miners to Join National Mining Pool

Reports say Venezuela has now legalized bitcoin mining following the decree recently issued by the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (Sunacrip). As part of the new regulations, all entities and individuals interested in legally mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies must now apply for a license from the agency.

According to a report, the decree will result in the creation of a National Digital Mining Pool (NDMP), a body that “seeks to bring together all the miners operating on the Venezuelan territory.” Meanwhile, the decree document, which was signed by Joselit Ramirez the superintendent of Sunacrip, does not specify “how much it will cost to obtain these licenses.”

However, to ensure miners conform with these new regulations, the decree reportedly states that:

The authorities will supervise both the creation and importation of mining equipment. Similarly, mining farms for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be able to operate with the support of the State, but only if they are inspected by Sunacrip.

As reported by News.bitcoin.com in July, Venezuela banned bitcoin mining operations in “any low-income neighborhoods with subsidized housing” due to what authorities termed “an excessive amount of power consumption.” Before that, the Venezuelan military had seized approximately 315 Bitmain Antminers.

However, according to regulations, which came into effect after September 21, Venezuela now wants “those who are operating ASIC equipment for mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” to connect to NDMP. Authorities now appear less concerned about excessive power consumption.

Miners operating outside the pool will be subject “to the measures, infractions, and sanctions as set forth in the decree document.”

Meanwhile, the report explains that if Venezuelan authorities insist on controlling and managing the NDMP, this will leave the government in charge of distributing rewards to miners. This, however, creates risks for miners as the pool operator can arbitrarily freeze funds or delay payments.

The crisis-torn country tops peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volumes in the region alongside Brazil, while it remains a key bitcoin mining territory. With a share of the hashrate around 0.42%, Venezuela is the only Latin American state to feature in Cambridge University’s top ten list of countries with the highest bitcoin hash rate.

However, now that the government has formalized bitcoin mining, Venezuela’s share of the total hash rate is likely to increase.

Amidst early rumours of a Second crypto Ban, Indian crypto industry prepares Draft Sandbox for Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Regulations in India

The Supreme Court ruling on Cryptocurrency released on 5th March this year had also recommended the Creation of Regulatory Framework on Cryptocurrency

This sandbox will help indian government to form the base for regulating cryptocurrency in India

BuyUcoin in collaboration with various Industry experts and insiders will release an early version of the Draft on 2nd October 2020

India can't afford to miss it- For the first time ever, all the Indian Crypto stakeholders led by BuyUcoin came together to propose the first ever framework to regulate cryptocurrency in India.

India is witnessing a new wave of renewed discussion for legality of cryptocurrency amidst recent rumors about the second ban on cryptocurrency and now it's a need of an hour to have a well-defined framework to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. The supreme court of India in its ruling against the RBI ban on the crypto-related transactions also recommended the creation of this framework.

BuyUcoin with the support of the crypto community stakeholders stepped up and initiated the discussion of the framework to another level and is ready with a draft consisting set of community driven rules, propositions and implementation methods.

""This is the first milestone of a long journey for making cryptocurrency accessible to the masses. This draft of the sandbox is driven by the inputs from Crypto experts and Industry insiders, this will not only help government to make laws but will also guide the startups and budding entrepreneurs to enter in this blooming Industry,"" says Shivam Thakral, CEO & Co-founder BuyUcoin .

While Indian economy continued to grapple with the global impacts of Coronavirus Pandemic, the Indian crypto industry emerged with growth rates unforeseeable in the scenario after the ruling of SC that upholded the Central Bank ban on banks dealing with cryptocurrency.

Charles Bovaird, VP at Quantum Economics and Forbes Senior Contributor said, ""Banning crypto trading would cause India to fall behind other nations that allow it. By lobbying the Indian authorities, industry participants can implement the much needed crypto regulations.""

Madhu Nayakkankuppam (ex-Managing Director, Goldman Sachs) who is currently leading a DeFi startup opined, ""The solution is to regulate the technology to prevent misuse, not to ban it outright to stifle innovation or encourage a parallel economy.""

The First draft of Sandbox will be released on 2nd October 2020 and can be accessed via buyucoin.com/sandbox and it invites participation through valuable feedback and beneficial inputs that can further help in strengthening this Regulatory Sandbox.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have received an electronic money licence from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to introduce their Gemini Trust company into the British market.

Customers will be able to buy products and services with Bitcoin by using their debit cards.

Investors will also be able to buy crypto using sterling directly from their bank accounts without paying foreign exchange fees through bank payments systems like SWIFT or CHAPS.

The story of the Winklevoss twins, who were contemporaries of Zuckerberg while studying at Harvard, was immortalised in David Fincher’s 2010 hit movie The Social Network. The twins received a $65m settlement for their involvement in the creation of Facebook.

Gemini said its approval from the FCA reflected its “ethos” of working with regulators and “asking for permission, rather than forgiveness”.

“The UK has been a significant, global financial hub for centuries,” the company said.

“It is a pioneer in both financial innovation and regulation. We’re proud to help usher the crypto revolution into this historic market and become a part of its rich tradition.”

Gemini said it abided by “high regulatory standards” to safeguard customers funds and protect their privacy.

Bitcoin is widely considered to be the pre-eminent cryptocurrency since it was launched in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency has endured massive fluctuations in price over the years reaching highs of as much as $10,000 (£7,730) in 2017. However, it corrected down as far as $5,000 shortly after the markets crashed and has been recovering steadily since, before reaching $12,000 in August. It has since moderated back down to just in excess of $10,000.

The Winklevoss twins were among its earliest investors, pumping $10m into the currency in 2012, with the investment tripling in value within a year.

The 39-year old pair claim that its business will offer secure protection against fraud and money laundering but will be going up against a series of other players in the European market.

In August, the FCA also gave crypto exchange Archax the green light to operate in Britain.

Facebook itself is also investing heavily in developing its own Libra cryptocurrency. The social media giant had planned to launch it within the first half of this year but regulators across the world have raised significant concerns with the currency.

In September of last year, France finance minister Bruno Le Marie urged Europe to ban Libra, claiming it would undermine the ""monetary sovereignty"" of governments. Despite the criticism, Facebook remains committed to the project.

Speaking of Facebook's currency last year, Cameron Winklevoss said that they needed to be ""frenemies"" or friendly enemies with Zuckerberg.",2020-09-24 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/us-dollar-downside-bitcoin-price,"Disclosure

Ethereum’s adjusted transfer of value (7-day average) has exceeded that of Bitcoin

ETH accomplished this feat on the 6th of September and has continued to increase its lead

The Ethereum network continues to process over 1 Million transactions per day setting an all-time high of 1.4 Million on September 17th when UniSwap was launched

Ethereum has eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of adjusted transfer of value which is calculated using a 7-day average. According to the team at Coinmetrics, ETH accomplished this feat on the 6th of September and continued to do so following the launch and distribution of the UniSwap (UNI) token on the 17th of September. The team at Coinmetrics shared this observation via the following tweet.

Ethereum Still Processing over 1 Million Transactions on a Daily Basis

Further expanding on the effects of the UniSwap (UNI) airdrop on the Ethereum network, the event on the 17th of September propelled the number of daily ETH transactions to a new all-time high value of 1,406,016.

A quick glance at Etherscan.io reveals that the daily ETH transactions on the Ethereum network have continued to total over 1 Million since the UniSwap event. Such a high number of transactions on the Ethereum network have been a regular occurrence since July 13th and coinciding with the popularity of the DeFi in the Crypto verse.

Below is a chart of the daily Ethereum transactions since late May, courtesy of Etherscan.io. From the chart, it can be observed that July 12th was the last time Ethereum daily transactions were below 1 Million.

Ethereum Fees Have Also Dropped Since UNI Distribution

A quick glance at Ethereum gas prices reveals that the average cost of sending ETH is now approximately 110 Gwei ($0.78). This is a drastic drop from the average transaction fee of $3 – $5 witnessed on the 17th of September as users of Uniswap rushed to claim their 400 UNI per eligible Ethereum address.",,https://www.coindesk.com/visa-significant-interest-crypto-companies,"Disclosure

Roughly $150 million in Bitcoin and ERC20 tokens were reportedly taken.

The exchange promises to cover losses from user funds.

KuCoin, which touts itself as ""the most advanced and secure cryptocurrency exchange to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, TRON, USDT, NEO, XRP, KCS, and more"" has been hacked, and $150 million in funds may be gone.

The company confirmed that late on September 25 (UTC time), ""Bitcoin, ERC-20 and other tokens in KuCoin's hot wallets were transferred out of the exchange.""

It maintains that, while its hot wallets were hit, its cold wallets are safe. Moreover, it claimed in its announcement, ""If any user fund is affected by this incident, it will be covered completely by KuCoin and our insurance fund.""

The trouble started when users started complaining about withdrawal issues.

Initially, KuCoin's admin team seemed to maintain that it was experiencing a systems issue. At least one admin message on KuCoin's Telegram channel indicated that users should not withdraw or deposit funds ""given the situation."" It claimed that ""transactions are simply pending.""

It then became apparent that about $150 million worth of tokens had been moved to a different address. The address received transactions of 11,484 Ether, worth roughly $4 million, plus $146 million in transactions of other tokens. Many are little-known, such as Gladius, Chroma, Ocean Token, and Hawala, but there were also Maker, OMG, and YFI tokens in the mix.

Adding to the confusion, Crypto data company Cryptoquant noticed that a large amount of Bitcoin left the KuCoin wallets quickly then stopped. ""Since 20:00 UTC on September 25th,"" it tweeted, ""the outflow has continuously been zero.""

It seems #Kucoin got hacked. Usually, after being hacked, the $BTC outflow increases rapidly and then becomes zero. Since 20:00 UTC on September 25th, the outflow has continuously been zero.

According to Cryptoquant CEO Ki Young Ju, that spike is a telltale sign of a hack. If it were merely a systems issue, outflows would go straight to zero without a spike.

KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu held a livestream early on September 26 to provide more details.

According to Lyu, after realizing that money was being transferred out of a KuCoin-owned hot wallet, they shut down the server. However, transfers continued because the private key to the hot wallet had been compromised. KuCoin then transferred untouched funds to a new address.

KuCoin has not confirmed the amount that was taken.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, KuCoin, based in Singapore is the 16th-most-popular crypto spot exchange when taking into account trading activity, traffic, and volume.

Technologists are experimenting with the vast-reaching potential of blockchain. And regulation is typically immature, inconsistent and unevenly applied across international borders, allowing entrepreneurs to move fast and break things, as it were.

But there’s also no shortage of competition. The latest example comes from CoinDesk’s Ian Allison, who reported Thursday that Tron, the three-year-old blockchain headed by Justin Sun (the crypto executive who paid $4.5 million to have a meal with Warren Buffett), has entered into a strategic alliance with custody specialist BitGo to accommodate wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) tokens.

Wrapped bitcoin is a tokenized version of the largest cryptocurrency, reformatted so it can move easily on a non-Bitcoin blockchain. It’s become popular among users of the Ethereum blockchain partly because traders can deposit the tokens in various decentralized finance or “DeFi” applications to receive juicy interest rates. Bitcoin doesn’t pay interest or dividends, a fact that sometimes draws comparisons to a “pet rock.” So DeFi is one of the main places that holders of bitcoin can go to make money off their holdings, aside from the usual speculative price gains.

The past few months’ explosion in DeFi, with the debut of automated trading platforms like Uniswap and copycat SushiSwap, has jammed the Ethereum network with congestion, driving up transaction fee rates and prompting rival blockchains to offer competing venues for developing new applications.

Now Tron apparently wants a piece of the thriving DeFi business. “Our new strategic alliance with Tron creates even greater opportunities for users to expand to other chains and tokenize their BTC,” BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said in a statement. That means “transacting at a lower cost and faster speed.”

There is so much more development and activity taking place on Ethereum that DeFi traders are unlikely to decamp en masse to Tron. But it’s good for the industry that they have the option.

Bitcoin Watch

Bitcoin implied volatility. Source: Skew.

Bitcoin’s 5% gain on Thursday confirmed its biggest single-day percentage gain since July 27.

While the recovery from weekly lows near $10,200 has been impressive, the immediate bias remains neutral. That’s because the cryptocurrency has yet to violate the three-week trading range of $10,000 to $11,000.

A big move could happen soon, since the one-month implied volatility has declined to 44%, the lowest level in nearly two years, according to data source Skew. In the past, an implied volatility of 50% or below has consistently paved the way for violent price action.

The gauge is now closing on the record low of 35% seen just ahead of the big crash from $6,000 to $4,500 seen in the second half of November 2018.

Token Watch

Ether (ETH): Traders might be using options market to hedge price risks of ether locked in DeFi liquidity pools.

Bitcoin (BTC): Options open interest hits record $2.1B with notional value of $1B set to expire Friday, potentially triggering volatility.

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): Three Arrows Capital mints 2,316 of the Ethereum-ready tokens, single largest issuance.

Avalanche (AVAX): Tokens in smart-contract platform (and Ethereum competitor) shoot up to $4 each, providing fast paper profit for investors who bought in just two months ago at 85 cents each in a $42M fundraise, Messari says.

Uniswap (UNI): Users claim 78% of existing UNI supply in first week, though Glassnode Insights op-ed argues that transition toward token-based governance via the UNI token falls far short of true decentralization.

The University of Cambridge and the school’s Centre for Alternative Finance has published the third “Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study.” The 71-page in-depth study examines the current growth of the crypto industry, mining, offchain activity, crypto asset user profiling, regulation, and security.

The September 2020 third edition of the Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study concentrates on four market segments which include mining, payments, custody, and exchange. A great number of participants from the cryptocurrency industry took part in the University of Cambridge (UC) study including wallet providers, exchanges, miners, cloud mining providers, crypto custodians, and more. The 71-page UC report says it leveraged two surveys from March and May 2020 to get a number of report’s metrics.

Employment Figures and Growth of the Crypto Industry

The UC report first delves into the crypto asset ecosystem’s employment figures and notes that even though the industry provides opportunity, there’s been a decline since 2017. “Respondents across all market segments, reported year-on-year growth of 21% in 2019, down from 57% in 2018,” the UC authors detail.

Furthermore, the mining sector was hit the hardest as it’s aggregated employment level saw a 37 point decline. Asia-Pacific (APAC) respondents recorded the highest share of high-growth enterprises in 2019 according to the data.

High growth is primarily younger firms that are 3-4 years old, and this represents 49% of the share of respondents. A few service providers polled detailed they saw an increase in profits in 2019 compared to years prior.

“Industry-wide, the growth in FTE employment declined by 36 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, whereas the median firm reported a 75-percentage point downward change in employment growth,” the UC benchmarking study notes.

Hashers and Global Mining Operations

The UC study then discusses the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem and the report highlights that mining is steadily reaching an “industrial scale.” The findings detail the criteria miners (hashers) leverage in order to choose which coin the operation should mine is entirely based on profit scaling.

The benchmark report notes that bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular coin with 89% of respondents mining the crypto asset. BTC is followed by ethereum (ETH – 35%) and bitcoin cash (BCH – 30%) respectively. Certain regions have different miner popularity ratings depending on the region and demographic.

“For instance, ethereum mining appears to be particularly popular among Latin American hashers, whereas bitcoin cash is more popular in APAC and North America,” the authors detail. “The mining of privacy coins in Western regions also differs from the global average: 28% and 19% of European and North American hashers report mining zcash, and as many North American hashers also engaged in monero mining.”

Crypto Mining Operational Expenditures and Renewable Energy

Moreover, the UC findings show that the utility cost for the average miner is roughly 79% of the aggregate operational expenditures. But there are differences that arise at the regional level, the study’s authors note.

“For instance, since the introduction of new tariffs on Chinese imports, US hashers have to pay 28% tariffs on ASICs shipped to the USA,” the report says.

While discussing electricity costs one takeaway from the study suggests the median Asian and North American miner pays roughly the same amount for electricity.

The mining section also examines Proof-of-Work’s (PoW) energy consumption, in general, and the subsidies or tax exemptions stemming from governments. Government benefits have entered the fray, but only “28% of the surveyed hashers report receiving support from governments.”

Additionally, the renewable energy estimate is much lower than prior reports concerning renewable energy and bitcoin mining. “39% of miners’ total energy consumption comes from renewables,” the UC study highlights. However, 76% of the survey respondents leverage a “mix” of traditional fuels like coal and renewables like hydropower.

“Hydropower is listed as the number one source of energy, with 62% of surveyed hashers indicating that their mining operations are powered by hydroelectric energy,” the UC study details. “Other types of clean energies (e.g. wind and solar) rank further down, behind coal and natural gas, which respectively account for 38% and 36% of respondents’ power sources.”

The Digital Asset Landscape and Crypto User Profiling

As far as the growing crypto asset landscape is concerned, bitcoin (BTC) is still the most popular cryptocurrency by representation on custodial services, payment processors, exchanges, and wallet providers. “Support has declined slightly over time from 98% of service providers in 2017 to 90% in 2020,” the UC authors mention.

Ethereum (ETH) is the second most commonly leveraged coin and the crypto asset is widely supported, while LTC, BCH, and XRP are available on at least 50% of 2020’s crypto service providers.

Moreover, despite the negative news and delistings, “zcash and monero are still becoming increasingly more available, and are supported at 24% and 17% of service providers respectively.” Since the second UC benchmark report, identity-verified crypto asset users have increased significantly.

The UC crypto study states:

In 2018, the 2nd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study estimated the number of identity-verified crypto asset users at about 35 million globally. Applying the same methodology, an update of this estimate indicates a total of up to 101 million unique crypto asset users across 191 million accounts opened at service providers in Q3 2020. This 189% increase in users may be explained by both a rise in the number of accounts (which increased by 37%), as well as a greater share of accounts being systematically linked to an individual’s identity, allowing us to increase our estimate of minimum user numbers associated with accounts on each service provider.

A Variety of Other Key Crypto Factoids

The vast amount of findings within UC’s study discusses a number of other subjects like stablecoins, IT security, and government regulations. Stablecoins like tether (USDT) have become very prominent and “increasingly available” the report highlights.

“Tether support [grew] from 4% to 32% of service providers and all non-Tether stablecoins [grew] from 11% to 55%. This increase is not simply from service providers holding stablecoins diversifying their holdings, but rather more service providers offering stablecoins,” the study insists.

The report also says, at the same time crypto asset companies are complying with new regulations, the “decoupling of duties, such as between custody, clearing and settlement responsibilities, appears to be underway” as well.

UC’s authors say the number of crypto companies that didn’t adopt know-your-customer rules (KYC), dropped from 48% to 13% during the last two years. This metric highlights that regulatory guidelines and compliance is on the rise. The UC study insists that the standards enforced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) invoked this significant change.

Despite the increase of KYC/AML procedures, UC’s third benchmark study underscores the recent emergence of decentralized finance (defi) platforms.

UC’s authors Apolline Blandin, Gina Pieters, Yue Wu, Thomas Eisermann, Anton Dek, Sean Taylor, and Damaris Njoki emphasize defi has introduced “more risky and experimental innovations.” In the near future, it is possible that crypto service providers will be impacted considerably by the defi space, the study notes. Defi will likely impact large crypto service providers in particular and their business models “in the next 12 months.”

The Israeli tax laws currently see Bitcoin and other digital currencies as assets, so any conversion of them into local fiat would bring taxes according to the set capital gains rates.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

Currently, Israeli individual investors have to pay a capital gains tax of 25 percent on most assets, but if the proposed bill is passed, this will be decreased significantly.

All the legislators behind the bill tabled on Tuesday are members of the nationalist political party, Yisrael Beiteinu. They claimed that the regulatory situation in Israel around digital currencies is not prepared, and thus, it will not match the industry requirements.

“[Digital currencies] will remain the engine of growth that will enable the technology industry to grow and flourish,” the translated summary of the bill stated.

Moreover, one of the bill sponsors argued on the advantages of using blockchain technology for promoting digital payment options during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.

Debates on Crypto Taxation

After long legal uncertainties and fights between the pro-crypto groups and governments, the Israeli government declared cryptocurrencies as assets in 2018, bringing some clarity in the industry. That was cemented last year as an Israeli court recognized Bitcoin and other digital currencies as assets, not currencies.

Meanwhile, the crypto tax debate is still hot across the world as regulators are struggling to tax digital currency gains properly. While reporting of incomes from the virtual currency is an issue, regulators are fighting to properly define cryptocurrencies.

Notably, most of the countries levy capital gains tax on crypto gains. South Korea recently amended its tax laws to charge a flat 20 percent tax on all crypto incomes.",2020-09-25 12:01:44+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/china-crypto-best-performing-asset,"Disclosure

Overall daily cryptorrency ETP volumes plunged by roughly 74%, dropping from $186.5 million exchanged in mid-August to an average of $48 million in mid-September.

Grayscale volumes take a hit

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust product represents the overwhelming amount of trading activity in cryptocurrency ETPs, and has therefore taken the biggest hit when it comes to trading volumes.

Grayscale’s top 3 cryptocurrency products, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG), lost a combined 77% in trading volume, decreasing from $180 million per day in mid-August to roughly $40 million.

The total asset under management figure (AUM) for Grayscale has also decreased since mid-August, although not nearly as drastically. Grayscale’s AUM has dropped 3.3% from $5.9 billion to $5.7 billion in the last 30 days.

Bitcoin price action drives long-term investors away

According to Constantine Tsavliris, Head of Research at CryptoCompare, the decrease in volumes for these crypto investment instruments has a lot to do with the recent price action of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. He told Cointelegraph:

“The BTC price dropped from approximately $12k to $10k at the beginning of September. Since then, markets have generally been bearish with a few bull runs throughout the month. ETP investors generally invest long-term, and therefore the recent drop in price combined with a generally bearish market has acted as a signal for more cautious trading behaviour.”

While Grayscale has seen the biggest slide in trading volumes, the drop in institutional volume for cryptocurrency ETPs seems to have affected most of the market and not just Grayscale. Tsavliris told Cointelegraph:",,https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-commodity-exchange-act-of-2020/,"Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020: US Lawmakers Propose Single National Crypto Framework

Lawmakers in the U.S. have introduced the Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020 to create a single, national regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading platforms, including those that trade bitcoin, ether, their forks, and other cryptocurrencies. On the same day, the Securities Clarity Act was also introduced.

Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020

The bill entitled “Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020 (DCEA)” was introduced by U.S. House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Michael Conaway on Thursday. He explained that the proposed legislation “creates a single, opt-in national regulatory framework for digital commodity trading platforms under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).” The bill is supported by lawmakers Austin Scott, Dusty Johnson, Tom Emmer, David Schweikert, and Darren Soto.

According to the bill summary provided by Conaway, the legislation aims to “fill in the regulatory gaps” that exist between the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in digital asset markets, adding:

It creates a framework to regulate trading venues which list emerging digital commodities, such as bitcoin, ether, their forks, and other similar digital assets, for public trading.

It also provides “a regulated process for presold digital commodities to become publicly available for trading,” the summary document details.

Under the proposal, a registered Digital Commodity Exchange (DCE) would be subject to CFTC oversight and regulations, including the “monitoring of trading activity, prohibition of abusive trading practices, minimum capital requirements, public reporting of trading information, conflicts of interest, governance standards, cybersecurity, and more. Exchanges would also be subject to limitations on which digital commodities they would be permitted to offer for trading.”

Conaway added that “Digital commodity trading platforms are currently required to comply with a complicated labyrinth of 53 state and territory regulatory frameworks, hindering the ability for newcomers to enter the market.”

“Registration with the CFTC would preempt the existing state-based money transmitter licensing regime trading venues are currently subjected to,” the summary continues, adding that the current system is “not fit-for-purpose when applied to a spot trading market.” In addition, the document states that “The current regime is cumbersome, requiring separate licensing in each individual state of operation, and insufficient, failing to provide oversight of the trading and market activities that occur on the platform,” emphasizing:

The registration regime is voluntary, but with strong incentives for properly placed trading venues to seek registration. Trading venues would be able to opt into the CFTC Digital Commodity Exchange regime or remain regulated under individual state money transmitter licenses.

Furthermore, a registered DCE would be required to hold customers’ cryptocurrencies in a Qualified Digital Commodity Custodian that is regulated by a state, federal, or international banking regulator. The regulator must impose at least the minimum standards set by the CFTC for the entity to be “qualified.” The full Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020 bill can be found here.

A second cryptocurrency-related bill was also introduced on Thursday. Congressman Tom Emmer introduced the Securities Clarity Act “to provide a path to regulatory certainty for digital assets and other emerging technologies under securities law,” he announced. In March, U.S. lawmakers introduced the Cryptocurrency Act of 2020.

Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today

Crypto trading has become lucrative. That has come with an increase in the number of crypto exchanges. This article looks into 5 of the biggest crypto exchanges.

Let's get to it;

1. Coinbase

Coinbase is the most used and trusted crypto exchange in the crypto world. Started in 2012, the exchange has expanded over the years. It supports all the major cryptos; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

Coinbase is also safe to use. It comes with regulations allowing it to operate in several states. The user interface is quite responsive and easy to use. As one of the largest exchanges, it comes with very high liquidity.

Coinbase supports several deposit and withdrawal methods. It allows for online payments and bank transfer for USD transactions.

The exchange provides for both beginners and experienced traders' needs. Coinbase is great for beginner traders. Coinbase Pro is for the gurus. The Pro version comes with additional charts and indicators.

Coinbase does not compromise on security. It provides for a custodial wallet for investors. The wallets keep coins safe for those learning their way on the platform. It is, however, not liable for losses caused by investor negligence.

The exchange comes with a few challenges. It is costly for the traders using the Coinbase Pro. It does not grant control of keys to users. Also, it has relatively lesser altcoins on the platform.

2. Binance

Binance was started in 2017 with a speciality in an altcoin. The crypto exchange has grown to offer a wide variety of crypto trading pairs.

Binance has grown to be one of the biggest crypto exchanges due to its lower fees. It also provides a wide variety of cryptos and fiat trading pairs. The exchange also comes with advanced charting. The traders get to understand the market movements for more accurate trades.

Binance has gained a reputation over the years. It supports high daily volumes trades for several users. It is an ideal site for those looking to trade in several cryptocurrencies. It lists more than 150 cryptocurrencies on the exchange platform. Not many other crypto exchanges can match that in digital currencies.

Binance also has its fair share of concerns. It is not so beginner-friendly. It also not available in some states in the US like New York. It also does not support US dollar deposits. It, however, covers this by supporting several other major currencies.

3. Bitfinex

The Singapore-headquartered digital asset exchange KuCoin said in a statement that it detected large withdrawals of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) tokens to an unknown wallet beginning at 19:05 UTC time on Friday.ÃÂ

In a live stream on 4:30 UTC time Saturday, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu said that one or more hackers obtained the private keys to the exchangeÃ¢ÂÂs hot wallets. KuCoin transferred what was left in them to new hot wallets, abandoned the old ones and froze customer deposits and withdrawals, Lyu said.

KuCoinÃ¢ÂÂs cold wallets were unaffected, Lyu claimed. Cold cryptocurrency wallets are not connected to the Internet and are considered more secure than hot cryptocurrency wallets.ÃÂ

In an updated statement on its website, KuCoin released a list of BTC, bitcoin SV (BSV), ETH, LTC, XRP, Stellar lumens (XLM), Tron (TRX) and Tether (USDT) wallet addresses where the stolen funds were transferred.

Two Ethereum wallets belonging to KuCoin have sent more than 11,480 ETH, which currently trades at a price of about $350, to the Ethereum wallet address associated with the hack, according to data from blockchain explorer Etherscan.

The Ethereum wallet address has also received over 150 Ethereum-based tokens worth more than $150 million from the two KuCoin Ethereum wallets, EtherscanÃ¢ÂÂs data shows.

The cryptocurrencies are trading around roughly $10,700 per BTC, $165 per BSV, $45 per LTC, $0.25 per XRP, $0.07 per XLM, $0.02 per TRX and $1 per USDT, as of writing.

Tether and several cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex have blacklisted the wallet addresses, according to the updated statement.

Over 200 cryptocurrency assets trade on KuCoin with a combined daily average volume of around $100 million, ranking it as one of the busiest trading exchanges, according to the cryptocurrency data site CoinGecko.

The price of KuCoinÃ¢ÂÂs exchange token KCS fell by 14% to $0.86 within an hour on Saturday as news of the security breach spread on social media.ÃÂ

KuCoin is investigating the hack with international law enforcement and stolen customer money will be Ã¢ÂÂcovered completelyÃ¢ÂÂ by an insurance fund, Lyu said.

Russia’s Ministry of Finance has drafted a bill with harsh penalties for anyone who does not report their cryptocurrency holdings above a certain level. Penalties include jail terms and fines.

New Russian Crypto Bill

The Russian Ministry of Finance has sent out a new draft bill addressing the circulation of cryptocurrency in Russia to interested government departments, local news outlet Kommersant reported this week. The bill contains amendments to the Russian Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Administrative Code, the Tax Code, and the law on combating money laundering, the publication conveyed, claiming to be familiar with the bill.

The main changes from the previous bill concern the obligation of citizens to declare their cryptocurrency operations as well as the content of their cryptocurrency wallets. The ministry proposes requiring exchanges and users to inform the tax authority about cryptocurrency transactions.

Noting that the market views the previous draft law as posing significant restriction to the circulation of cryptocurrency in Russia, Kommersant reported that the new draft law is even more strict. “In particular, any person (natural or legal) who has received digital currency or digital rights of more than 100,000 rubles [$1,280] in a calendar year is obliged to inform the tax authority and submit an annual report on transactions with such assets and the balances of these assets.”

Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner (Russia) LLP’s senior tax lawyer Dmitry Kirillov explained that if the amendments are adopted, the first report will have to be submitted by April 30, 2021, for the 2020 tax filing year. He added:

For failure to report to the tax authority, you can get a fine of 30% of crypto assets, but not less than 50,000 rubles.

Roman Yankovsky, a member of the commission on legal support of the digital economy of the Moscow branch of the Russian Lawyers’ Association, noted that foreign cryptocurrency businesses, including crypto exchanges and depositories, must send the tax authority quarterly information about their Russian cryptocurrency operations. While believing that “hardly anyone will take this rule seriously,” he elaborated:

The liability is not limited to fines. Non-declaration of a crypto wallet if more than 1 million rubles [$12,796] have passed through it per year becomes a criminal offense of up to three years in prison. Also, forced labor can be used as a punishment.

Experts criticize the amendments are too harsh. Malta-based broker Exante co-founder Anatoly Knyazev, for example, believes that the penalties are disproportionate to the violations.

The Ministry of Finance also emphasized that recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are being considered, but noted that no final decision has been made on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia.

The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the proposed bill is under consideration for adoption in connection with the law on digital financial assets and digital currencies which will enter into force on Jan. 1, 2021.

Russia’s telecom regulator Roskomnadzor has added Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, to the list of blacklisted websites in the country.

The exchange was blacklisted on June 2, 2020, but Binance became aware of this only on September 24th, after receiving communication from Roskomnadzor.

In an announcement on its Russian Telegram channel, Binance said it was included on the list of prohibited domains because its website includes information about the purchase and sale of crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC).

According to Roskomnadzor, Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, distribution of such data is restricted in the country.

However, Russians can still access the exchange without the use of censorship-resistant tools such as a virtual private network (VPN). Binance said crypto users’ funds stored with the platform are safe. It is also taking legal advice on the way forward.

In its announcement, the exchange revealed that it had not received any prior warning from Russian authorities about any violations.

We were not previously notified of any claims by law enforcement agencies, civil government services or courts prior to receiving the above notification. We have now engaged our legal counsels for further advice and would like to assure all of our Russian users that there will be no disruption to their services in the interim and that their funds are safe.

Roskomnadzor has previously blacklisted Bestchange.ru, a major local crypto data aggregator. Digital assets have somewhat remained a grey area in Russia for a long time, although the Eastern European country has now officially classified virtual currencies as property. However, cryptocurrency cannot be used to pay for goods and services.

In recent months, Russia’s finance ministry has released a number of crypto-related bills that, on the whole, appear to criminalize crypto transactions. The country is now updating the proposed laws, looking to impose heavy fines and jail terms on Russian users who fail to declare their crypto earnings to the country’s tax agency.

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday, September 24, filed a complaint against crypto dealing Paxforex for allegedly soliciting or accepting business from US customers without relevant registration.

According to a report, the CFTC wants a U.S. court to stop Paxforex from continuing with the “unlawful acts and practices,” as well as to compel the company to comply with the relevant laws. Furthermore, the commodity regulator wants the court to stop the defendant “from engaging in any commodity-related activity.”

In a complaint submitted to the Texas Southern District Court, the CFTC argues that from March 2018 to present, Paxforex violated the law by:

“Soliciting or accepting orders from non-eligible contract participants (“non-ECPs”), not conducted on or subject to the rules of any Commission-regulated exchange, for the purchase or sale of gold, silver, ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and bitcoin (BTC) on a leveraged, margined or financed basis that does not result in the actual delivery of the commodities to the customer.”

Furthermore, the CFTC states that by not registering as a futures commission merchant (FCM) with the Commission, the trading company, which “accepts money, securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu thereof) in the form of bitcoin, is in violation of Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6d(a)(1) (2018).”

On its website, Paxforex claims owners of the company have extensive experience in forex, stocks, options, and CFDs markets as traders and dealers. This experience was gained when the founders worked in managerial positions with the largest brokers, who are now our major competitors.”

In the meantime, the CFTC is asking the court to impose civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including trading and registration bans, restitution, rescission, pre-judgment, and post-judgment interest.

Why investors are flocking to DeFI cryptos

Several DeFi crypto assets have had their share of the spotlight in recent times, with cryptos such as Chainlink, Compound, YAM, UniSwap, Cream finance, and Melon gaining investors’ capital inflows.

Using “Defi” technology, one can build smart contracts with codes that facilitate the actions of intermediaries, including managing and accepting deposits, handling collateralized loans, and liquidating collateral assets as per the terms of the contracts, should their values fluctuate.

Although DeFi assets, about few days back, had experienced some price corrections due to the rebound of the dollar and overbought indicators, the market seems to show a bullish bias relatively in the midterm, as Defi based investors increase their asset purchases momentarily.

DeFi crypto owners in some cases can typically receive better interest rates than they would from traditional banks on the basis that lower operating costs is enabled by operating on an automated decentralized network

As a credit to blockchain technology, the contract codes cannot be terminated or manipulated by any entity, and are executed with specific conditions.

The more two parties trust each other, the more they will feel confident engaging in transactions. Not just engaging in a high volume of transactions, but higher value transactions, too.

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are certainly accomplishing a lot when it comes to creating a decentralized environment where the ability to trust another party is taken out of the equation by a blockchain. Hardcore enthusiasts who already understand this are the ones most willing to reach into their coffers and pour money into the crypto revolution. The truth is, though, that the average consumer still isn’t at that point yet.

Some libertarians probably don’t want to hear this, but in order for the crypto world to reach critical mass, it needs much broader adoption, and the average consumer is going to need another layer of protection in place. They need a set of rules and somebody to complain when things go awry.

There are levels to this

Blockchain technology certainly does an amazing job of allowing participants to exchange value in a trustless environment. If you don’t share your private keys, nobody can steal your value. Teaching this to newly minted crypto holders is fundamental to getting them to buy in.

While many view that next step as a hindrance to adoption, regulation in the crypto space will most certainly accelerate it. The more layers we add to the safety net for consumers, the more confident new investors and adopters will be in getting involved.

Rules let freedom reign

The Bank Secrecy Act took effect in the 1970s and stands as the first piece of significant legislation in the United States surrounding Anti-Money Laundering and terrorist financing. It essentially forces banks to cooperate with the U.S. government in fighting financial crime. Following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in September of 2001, the Patriot Act was born, further opening up the lines of communication between banks and governments in the same vein.

Fast-forward to 2019, an international governing body called the Financial Action Task Force extends the travel rule to include not just banks but virtual assets and exchanges. The rule stipulates that virtual asset service providers must share the identities of users trading assets worth $1,000 or more.

Related: FATF AML regulation: Can the crypto industry adapt to the travel rule?

Tracking and providing that information sounds pretty straightforward, and it should be that way. But it also means virtual asset service providers need to fulfill all kinds of other tasks in order to become compliant, including:

Establishing what a typical crypto transaction looks like so that they can spot abnormal patterns signifying potential criminal activity.

Screening customer wallets regularly.

Sharing a list of potentially blacklisted customers with other virtual asset providers and authorities.

Sharing Know Your Customer information with virtual asset providers and authorities.

The inherent challenges with the FATF travel rule are certainly very real ones. For one, it requires buy-in from many virtual asset providers running blockchain projects and exchanges using different technologies. This makes tracking customer information at a granular level more difficult. That said, the benefit of the travel rule will outweigh those challenges. It stretches beyond the typical KYC procedures most crypto service providers follow. KYC relates mostly to an organization’s internal processes. The travel rule is much broader in nature. It pushes both virtual asset providers and governments to be transparent. It aims to go beyond the idea of individual nations subscribing to their own rules surrounding crypto.

Tools that will aid regulators in the near and distant future

The Ontario Securities Commission in Canada recently ruled that cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, which operates out of the Seychelles Islands, isn’t properly registered to serve residents of the province and thus has to cease accepting new registrations and trades from Ontarians.

More of these kinds of rulings will continue to come out of the woodwork, forcing virtual asset service providers to either adjust and comply, or take on the risks associated with doing business under the radar. The former and not the latter is the better long-term proposition for both crypto businesses and investors alike.

There are several tools — and more are coming — that aid regulators in continuing to develop better frameworks. They allow the average consumer to feel more comfortable with getting into cryptocurrency through any number of properly vetted on-ramps.

Most avid crypto traders are familiar with blockchain explorers — either publicly available or advanced ones being developed by private companies — that aim to dig deeper into the origins of transactions. This gives law enforcement the technology needed to track stolen funds, money laundering and criminal purchases made with crypto. The action of law enforcement adds trust to the ecosystem, making it safer for broad adoption.

Risk-scoring solutions are also being developed that allow market participants, including exchanges and individuals, to see whether counterparty wallets or proposed transactions carry risk. This knowledge will allow exchanges to steer clear of stolen funds, money laundering and bad actors. This again adds trust to the ecosystem.

The future of crypto regulation is happening now

Just in the last few days, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a regulatory body representing all U.S. states and territories, has announced the launch of a new regulatory framework for payment companies, money service businesses and cryptocurrency companies. Only Montana, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are not included in the launch.

Related: How the US and Europe are regulating crypto in 2020

This new framework requires major payment providers like Western Union, PayPal and 76 other money services and crypto-related businesses to undergo a thorough examination of their AML practices. Altogether, this new framework will regulate payment services that are responsible for transferring over $1 trillion in customer funds annually.

Ultimately, this launch and the broader impact of the FATF travel rule will serve to hold both businesses and market participants accountable for tracking transaction data, engaging in proper KYC protocols, and serving crypto adopters both old and new with added layers of protection that make investing in cryptocurrencies a more welcoming proposition.

Increased regulation and law enforcement is the path leading to exponential increases in the adoption of digital assets both now and in the future. And it is inevitably coming.

Key Takeaways Ethereum scaling startup Optimism has released a limited testnet version of its Layer-2 solution.

Apart from ZK-rollups, optimistic is the other leading solution for smart contract scalability on Ethereum.

Synthetix Network was the first DeFi project to join the testnet. Others like Chainlink and Uniswap are following close behind.

Share this article

Optimism PBC has launched the first phase of its Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Leading DeFi platforms beginning with Synthetix Network, Chainlink, and Uniswap are already lining up to enjoy cheaper and faster network speeds.

DeFi Projects Choose Optimism

As many DeFi projects rely on composability with one another, constant smart contract calls have been the primary reason for Ethereum’s congestion as of late.

This has led to an increase in the transaction fee and long wait times for many popular applications, even causing some to shut down. A rollup offers one solution to this problem.

A rollup executes smart contracts outside of Ethereum and only uses the Layer-1 network to store the result. The solution reportedly offers a 100x improvement in transactions per second (TPS) on the Ethereum network.

On Sept. 25, Optimism announced the first phase of the Optimistic rollup testnet by partnering with the decentralized derivatives exchange platform Synthetix.

Synthetix will incentivize participants with 200,000 SNX (worth $990,000 at press time) to use the testnet.

Optimistic will be introduced in four phases, as the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) is finally linked to Ethereum’s mainnet. For now, it will only cater to minting and burning Synthetix’s stablecoin, sUSD, and claiming the SNX rewards.

Upgrading the DeFi Ecosystem

ZK-rollups and Optimistic rollups are the two leading solutions for scaling Ethereum smart contracts and dApps.

ZK-rollups promises to scale Ethereum to 500 tx/sec and leverages non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs).

While Tether chose ZK-rollups for scaling USDT transactions on Ethereum, the DeFi ecosystem looks to have opted for Optimistic rollups.

According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Optimistic rollups are the intermediary solution for scaling Ethereum before the launch of ETH 2.0. Nevertheless, it is the easier one to implement with numerous individual calls on DeFi smart contracts.

Kain Warwick, the founder of the Synthetix, noted in his plans for L2 Synthetix that:

“I strongly believe that the transition of much of DeFi to the OVM will be an inflection point where DeFi is no longer a whale game, but is accessible to anyone to both build on and use.”

The other leading incumbent for Optimism integration is Uniswap. Currently, the fees for a simple swap on the DEX between Ether and DAI charges more than $15.

Integrating OVM could bring these fees down and may be included in Uniswap’s third iteration, Uniswap V3.

KuCoin, the cryptocurrency exchange hacked on Friday, has disclosed additional “suspicious addresses” to which a hacker sent around $10.7 million worth of Bitcoin. Tallying up all cryptocurrency addresses shared by the Singapore-based exchange brings the total amount lost in the hack to $203 million. (The true damage may be higher, should KuCoin share additional addresses).

But at the same time, cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain projects have frozen some of the stolen assets to minimize the damage. And they’ve done a pretty comprehensive job.

Orion Protocol has updated its smart contract to render $8.5 million stolen tokens obsolete, Covesting has frozen the $520,000 stolen, and KardiaChain has invalidated $9 million worth of tokens.

Crypto company Velo Labs announced that it will invalidate all of the 122 million VELO tokens stolen in the hack, worth about $76 million. VIDT Datalink will freeze 14 million VIDT, worth about $6.4 million. SilentNotary will replace all of its tokens, including the $94,692 affected, and Ocean Protocol paused its smart contract after $8.6 million was lost.

Tether, the stablecoin company that produces an eponymous US dollar-pegged coin, froze $22 million worth of the cryptocurrency. (No word yet on what will happen to the penis.finance, PUMPANOMICS, RETARD TOKEN, The Hunger Game and Dino Token that ended up in the hacker's wallet).

This means that crypto projects have frozen or rendered obsolete—or intend to do so about $130 million of stolen funds, or 65% of the haul so far, according to information disclosed by KuCoin. That makes it difficult for the hacker to sell those funds on secondary markets and ruin the fragile economies of smaller tokens.

But not impossible. Some of those assets haven't been frozen yet, and today the hacker started to launder some of the money. The hacker has sold a couple of thousand dollars worth of Ocean tokens on decentralized exchanges Uniswap in exchange for Ethereum, and trace amounts of Synthetix and Ampleforth have also left the suspicious Ethereum wallet.

Despite all of this, KuCoin is still out of pocket of at least $200 million. It says its insurance fund is large enough to cover all of its users. It estimates that withdrawals and deposits will return within a week.",2020-09-27 13:55:43,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-27/vulture-investor-feasts-on-crypto-whales-seeking-quick-exits,"Why did this happen?

In other news, recently released data from CryptoCompare show trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchange traded products (ETP) plunged from about $186.5 million per day in mid-August to an average of $48 million in mid-September.

A major chunk of the ETP volume comes from Grayscale’s products and according to the data, trading volumes on these dropped to about $40 million a day in mid-September. This shows that investors have stalled their purchases as they wait for the crypto markets to resume their uptrend.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that could start a trending move this week.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin surged from the uptrend line on Sep. 24 and has been consolidating close to the $10,800 resistance since then. This shows that the bears are trying to stall the relief rally at the current levels but the bulls have not allowed the price to drop below $10,500.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, tight consolidation near a resistance shows that the short-term bulls are not in a hurry to close their position as they expect higher levels. A close (UTC time) above $10,800 could result in a move to $11,178 but it’s expected that bears will defend this level.

The flat moving averages and the relative strength index just below the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.

A breakout of $11,178 may tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls and lead to a move to $12,460. Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair drops below $9,835 the bears will be in command.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has formed a flag pattern following the rally from the uptrend line. A breakout of this setup will increase the possibility of an up-move to the overhead resistance at $11,178.

The RSI is taking support close to 50 and the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which suggests a slight advantage for the bulls.

However, the failure of the bulls to push the price above $10,824 is likely to attract profit booking and the bears will then try to sink the pair below $10,558. If they succeed, the uptrend will be in danger of breaking down.

DOT/USD

Polkadot (DOT) has formed a large symmetrical triangle pattern, which shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. This uncertainty will resolve after the price breaks above or below the triangle.

If the bears sink and sustain the DOT/USD pair below the support line of the triangle, it will suggest that the sellers have overpowered buyers. The bulls will try to defend the $3.50 support but a break below it can pull down the price to $2.00.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($4.59) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into negative territory, which suggests that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand.

This negative view will be invalidated if the pair turns up from the current levels and breaks out of the resistance line of the triangle. The next target to watch on the upside is $5.50 and above it $6.50.

DOT/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in negative territory suggest that the short-term advantage is with the bears. The bears will now have to sink the price below the triangle to further solidify their position.

However, if the pair again rebounds sharply from the support line of the triangle, it will suggest that the bulls are aggressively buying on dips to this support. If the buyers can propel the price above the triangle, a quick move to $5.50 may be on the cards.

Contrary to these assumptions, if the price does not make a sharp move from the triangle, it will suggest that neither party has been able to establish their dominance. In such a case, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days.

CRO/USD

Crypto.com Coin (CRO) has formed a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $0.144743. After a long uptrend, this bearish setup suggests that the altcoin may be on the verge of making a top.

CRO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.157) has started to turn down and the RSI has been trading in the negative territory, suggesting an advantage to the bears. If the price sustains below $0.144743, the CRO/USD pair can drop to the target objective of $0.10607.

However, if the pair rebounds off the $0.144743 support, it will show that the bulls are buying on dips to this level. They will then try to push the price above the resistance line of the triangle.

If they succeed, it will invalidate the bearish setup and can result in a rally to $0.183416 and above it to $0.191101.

CRO/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The pair is currently trading inside a tight range of $0.151649 and $0.154582, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.

If the price breaks below $0.151649, the advantage will shift in favor of the bears and will increase the possibility of a drop to $0.144743.

This negative view will be invalidated if the pair turns up from the current levels and sustains above $0.154582.

XEM/USD

The bulls pushed NEM (XEM) above the resistance line of the falling wedge pattern on Sep. 26 but are struggling to sustain the breakout. The bears are currently trying to pull the price back into the wedge.

XEM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the XEM/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($0.115), it will be a positive sign as it will suggest that the bulls are buying on dips. If the bulls can push the price above $0.127, the XEM/USD pair can move up to $0.14 and then to $0.1690655.

The upsloping 50-day simple moving average ($0.105) and the RSI in the positive territory suggests that the bulls are at a slight advantage.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the moving averages and may indicate that the current breakout is a bear trap.

XEM/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have not been able to sink and sustain the pair back inside the wedge, which shows that the bulls purchased the recent dip to the breakout level. If they can now push the price above $0.1260149 the up-move may begin.

It is unlikely to be an easy path for the bulls because the bears will try to stall the rally at $0.13 and then again at $0.145.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears can sink the price below the moving averages, the pair can drop to $0.10.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) dropped below the $2.2080 support on Sep. 20 and followed it up with a further fall to $1.9117 on Sep. 21. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.

XTZ/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Currently, the bears are attempting to stall the pullback at the downtrend line. If they succeed, the XTZ/USD pair can drop to $1.9117 and if this support also cracks the decline may extend to $1.50.

However, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA ($2.37), it will suggest that the most recent breakdown was a bear trap. The first target on the upside is $2.7434 and above this level the up-move can reach the 50-day SMA ($3.04).

Traders can keep a watch on the RSI because a break above the 40 level will be the first sign that the downtrend may be weakening.

XTZ/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are attempting to form a double bottom pattern close to the $1.915 level while the bears are trying to resume the downtrend. If the bears can sink the price below $2.09, a drop to $1.9117 is likely and the downtrend could resume.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $2.2788, a short term reversal could be on the cards.

Bitcoin and the entire crypto market has faced some heightened selling pressure throughout the past day, with bears moving to regain control of BTC

This has sent shockwaves throughout the entire crypto market, causing many tokens to plunge lower

Analysts are now widely noting that the entire market could be well-positioned to see further losses in the near-term.

One trader is noting that BTC reeling towards an “accumulation range” within the $9,000 region is a possibility

That being said, the same trader also believes that a push up towards $12,600 could still be imminent in the near-term.

Bitcoin is facing some heightened selling pressure as its price sits within the $10,600 range. This is around where it has been trading throughout the past few days, with buyers and sellers being unable to gain any control over its near-term outlook.

Yesterday, bulls attempted to take control of its near-term trend when they pushed it up to highs of $10,800. This is around where its price began stalling, and where it ultimately faced a rejection that sent it down to lows of $10,600.

While sharing his thoughts on where Bitcoin may trend in the near-term, one analyst explained that although he is anticipating some short-term turbulence, he still expects it to rally higher in the mid-term.

Bitcoin Shows Signs of Weakness as Consolidation Phase Persists

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down just under 1% at its current price of $10,650. This is around where it has been trading throughout the past few days.

Yesterday, however, the crypto did face a grim rejection at $10,800 that struck a serious blow to its near-term outlook.

Its current trading range exists between $10,500 and $10,800. Which of these levels is firmly broken above or below first should provide investors with significant insights into its near-term outlook.

Trader: BTC’s Market Structure Suggests It Is Poised to Move Towards $12,600

While sharing his thoughts on where Bitcoin may trend in the near-term, one analyst explained that he still believes a mid-term movement to $12,600 is imminent.

He does note that it may first enter an “accumulation range” within the $9,000 region.

“BTC Monthly Outlook: Depending on monthly close, either we see some type of accumulation in the 9000’s range before we end up eventually break above $12,500 and flip that key level… Anyways, $12,600 gets broken at some point in the next 6 months and I think we see new ATH’s.”

The financial rating agency says it uses a unique model that measures thousands of data points as it ranks each crypto asset in categories such as technology, adoption, investment risk, and market momentum.

According to the US-based analysis firm, Cardano (ADA), Tezos (XTZ), Fantom (FTM), and Cosmos (ATOM) are the four best crypto assets in terms of technology, giving all of them an “Excellent” rating. Holo (HOT), Ethereum (ETH), Iota (IOTA), Bitshares (BTS), Grin (GRIN), and Nexus (NXS) all received a “Good” rating from Weiss. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP both received “Fair” ratings.

When it comes to adoption, Ethereum leads the pack with a rating of “A.” Bitcoin comes in at number two with an “A-” adoption grade. XRP, Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), and Tezos all received an adoption grade of “B.”

As for the overall rating, Bitcoin is tied with Ethereum with both cryptocurrencies receiving a “B+” rank. XRP, Stellar, Litecoin, and Tezos closely follow with a “B-” grade.

Meanwhile, Weiss Crypto is also keeping a close watch on the price action of the crypto markets. In a blog post, analyst Juan Villaverde says crypto assets are showing signs of recovery after falling sharply in the past weeks.

“There is a silver lining: we’re starting to see clear evidence – including price action over the seven-day trading week ended yesterday –that an important low may have been established for most crypto assets around Sept. 9.”

According to Villaverde, it is possible that the lows hit early this month is a sign that crypto markets are forming a base in preparation for a bull rally before the year expires.

As for Bitcoin, Villaverde says it remains the clear market leader.

“As we’ve often said, this is critical to a sustainable crypto bull market, as Bitcoin is the go-to asset for new money seeking refuge from the rampant asset price inflation policies being pursued by most central banks.”",2020-09-27 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/most-crypto-exchanges-are-vulnerable-by-design-says-bybit-ceo,"Crypto exchange security is once again in the news after hackers breached KuCoin. But this shouldn’t surprise people as exchanges are vulnerable by design, according to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou.

Zhou told Cointelegraph that exchanges act as a single point of failure. As a centralized web application, exchanges are susceptible to the same security issues as all other websites.

Security becomes even more important as investors and traders are increasingly taking exchanges to task to protect funds.

The vast majority of crypto exchange servers and storage networks, Zhou said, keep digital currencies in hot wallets. If hot wallets are not properly protected, then this opens them up to theft. Zhou thinks that a cold wallet system is more secure since hot wallets are connected to the internet, making them more vulnerable to hacking. Cold wallets, on the other hand, are not connected online. The only downside is not being able to make large withdrawals from an exchange immediately.

According to Zhou, investing in security should be one of the highest priorities on an exchange platform’s agenda, especially if it operates online. To combat potential hacking threats, exchanges also need to better address vulnerable areas and apply multiple security layers for penetration testing.

Any security system should also protect information across all points of interaction. This means protecting user data from account registration, login, trading, and any information exchange with the platform. Zhou added that:

“This can be accomplished by applying best practices for application lifecycle management, hiring knowledgeable and reputable security consultants for penetration testing and running bounty programs within the white hat community to identify any potential vulnerabilities.”

Zhou also recommends cryptocurrency exchanges work with reputable security firms to carry out security audits, apply strict management processes, and invest in zero-trust architecture. Zero-trust architecture requires verification for anyone accessing a service to prevent any potential data breaches both internally and externally.

He said there are several bespoke security solutions from third-party vendors that exchanges can use but noted these could also be developed in-house.

Zhou revealed that Bybit invested considerable resources in developing and enhancing its own security protocols and solutions. They have implemented a multi-signature cold wallet system to protect the safety of users' funds. ​

When it comes to combating potential hacking threats, Bybit organized and conducted multiple red alert scenarios and bounty programs with the white hat hacker community. This is to ensure there are no system vulnerabilities. Zhou added that:

“Even when it comes to withdrawals, we subject any requests to at least three layers of risk-control verifications. Crypto asset consolidation among cold wallets follows the strictest policy, including physical environment security, system security, encryption techniques, operation authentication, monitoring and audit.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the recent crypto twitter hack was a wake-up call for centralized platforms to address online security issues.",,https://www.coindesk.com/stablecoin-statement-innovation-trigger,"An unsurprising statement from a financial regulator is sending some welcome signals that point to a spurt of innovation ahead.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a statement earlier this week saying that national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.

This is not a surprise, as banks have been doing so for some time. But they have been doing so under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The statement gives the first sign of official clarity on the idea that stablecoins are legitimate representations of value.

Acceptance and support

Why is this significant for markets?

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

To start with, it signals a growing regulatory acceptance of stablecoins. While fiat-backed blockchain-based tokens have been often talked about in the halls of power, especially after Facebook’s stablecoin project Libra was announced last year, they had not been recognized in an official statement as an acceptable result of financial innovation – until now.

And the U.S. is not the only significant economic bloc to signal acceptance: Earlier this week, the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a report that assesses the threats stablecoins could pose. But rather than hint that stablecoins might be in trouble, the report conveys that the ECB is figuring out how to mitigate the potential risks.

The issue was becoming urgent, given the explosive increase in stablecoin demand. The total value of stablecoins has now surpassed $18 billion, up from $10 billion just four months ago. Much of this growth has been driven by international demand for dollars as well as the increasingly sophisticated financial tools being built on top of public blockchain technology. USDC, the leading U.S.-based stablecoin, has seen its market cap almost quadruple so far this year, to over $2 billion.

Source: Coin Metrics, CoinDesk Research

Reading between the lines, the message goes even further. Acceptance is one thing; support is another. The OCC is signaling to banks that stablecoin activity is legitimate, and that reserve accounts will be offered the same federal protections as any other.

This could incentivize banks to actively seek stablecoin business, and in so doing, broaden both their client base and their stake in crypto markets.

A recent statement from the OCC said that U.S. national banks could now custody crypto assets. Presumably that includes stablecoins, too. So, a bank could attract not just stablecoin issuers, but also their clients. It would then make sense to facilitate the transfers of stablecoins between clients, and (why not) even between banks. New payments networks could emerge, which in turn could give rise to a host of new banking services. For an industry squeezed by low interest rates and looming defaults, this potential growth vector will eventually start to look attractive.

And since one of the main use cases today for U.S.-based stablecoin USDC (the second largest stablecoin by market cap) is extracting yield from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, this could be the incentive needed for traditional finance to start to take an open-minded look at the innovations going on in blockchain-based financial applications. New clients could be courted with new types of savings products, which could in turn accelerate the transformation of traditional banking.

Growth and innovation

It could also embolden new types of stablecoin issuers to come forward with further innovations. To those of us working in the industry, it may seem like stablecoin issuers are everywhere. Looking in from the outside, however, most of them are either small, offshore or both. Other than the members of USDC issuer CENTRE Consortium, founded by Coinbase and Circle in 2018, there are few large U.S.-based corporations commercially active in the space.

Last year, we reported that IBM was building support for a network of stablecoin-issuing banks, and that Wells Fargo had created a corporate stablecoin for internal cross-border transfers.

JPMorgan is apparently still working on JPM Coin, also designed for cross-border payments between institutional clients, announced in 2019. Visa is looking at ways to harness the potential of stablecoins for B2B payments. The list goes on, but no large corporation has yet successfully launched a stablecoin with real-world traction. That is likely to change.

Blockchain-based tokens to represent internal transfers is a relatively straightforward application, and just the tip of what’s possible. An as-yet unexplored option is that of programmable monetary instruments, such as stablecoins that have embedded KYC, or stablecoins that could be distributed amongst certain communities for specific uses limited by code. The OCC statement is likely to give momentum to collaboration between corporations and their banks on creative payments and engagement tools.

The fine line between securities and stablecoins with features is no doubt a factor holding back many private projects. There seems to be regulatory progress there, too. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said this week that they are open to discussions with stablecoin issuers as to whether or not their token would classify as a security – which implies that some would not. While not exactly clarity, it does open the regulatory door to more conversations about innovation at the highest levels, as well as case-by-case decisions that, while slow, would at least give a more solid foundation for development.

Gaps and standards

There are barriers, however.

The infrastructure is still young, and although it is growing rapidly in both scope and scalability, the public blockchains on which most current stablecoins run have scalability issues which at times can push up fees to uncomfortable levels. And, given recent progress in payments infrastructure, stablecoin payments may end up being slower than paying by some more traditional methods. Stablecoin settlement is also still an issue. The U.S. Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covers settlement finality (a legal construct that defines the point after which a transaction cannot be reversed) for private systems, but does not address the issue of blockchain settlement finality. With proof-of-work blockchains, settlement is probabilistic, not definite, until a certain number of blocks have passed. And even then, time just makes it increasingly unlikely that a transaction can be reversed. At what stage does a blockchain-based transaction become totally irrevocable? This is understandably an important issue for market participants.

And for many use cases, using stablecoins could add a middleman, rather than streamline operations. This could further impact costs, especially if different fiat currencies are at either end of a transaction.

The potential utility in cross-border transfers highlights the need for an international framework if these instruments are to fulfill their potential to streamline flows of capital. Earlier this month, the Governor of the Bank of England called for a G20 mandate for standard-setting bodies to clarify standards.

In April, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the responses to its public consultation on global stablecoin regulation, which make for constructive reading. While not a regulator, the FSB monitors the global financial system and makes recommendations to protect its stability and integrity, and its work could provide a structure for international cooperation.

And regulators will always be concerned about the fragility risks that growing stablecoin popularity could introduce into the global financial system.

A welcome start

Regulatory clarity of any sort is an underappreciated trigger for innovation. True, the crypto industry has no shortage of creative code and ambitious applications. It also has no shortage of people willing to put time and money into devising new applications for new types of value. And the whirlwind of activity going on in the decentralized finance space is generating astonishing growth – since the start of 2020, value locked in DeFi contracts has increased from roughly $675 million to over $8 billion.

But that is still a small speck in the financial universe. Adoption and impactful applications will not make a meaningful impact on finance until regulatory clarity encourages serious money to take notice.

I struggled to come up with a metaphor that could represent this type of trigger, one that did not involve everything falling down (which means dominoes are out), things blowing up (the spark in the fireworks shed won’t do) or anything to do with viral contagion (because obviously).

In the end, the best I could come up with was a seed that becomes a tree that is so impressive it encourages planters in other regions to plant their own. This image is lacking in oomph and sparkle, but finance moves slowly. And even a forest of new trees would not convey the scale of innovation that we could be on the verge of seeing. It is hopefully a reminder, though, that meaningful and long-lasting change starts small.

A comprehensive crypto industry overview

The University of Cambridge’s latest industry survey is out, with no shortage of surprising findings. This is their third edition, and compiles data from 280 entities from 59 countries, across four market segments: exchange, payments, custody and mining. It’s an insightful overview into how crypto businesses are faring around the world, and highlights some interesting trends.

Full-time employee growth slowed to 21% in 2019, down from 57% in 2018. The decline was especially notable in smaller firms, which implies that a few large players are dominating the industry.

On average, 39% of proof-of-work mining is powered by renewable energy, primarily hydroelectric, while 76% of miners say they use some form of renewables in their energy mix. This is up from 28% and 60%, respectively, in 2018.

Approximately 13% of miners now use financial products such as hashrate or crypto asset derivatives to hedge risks.

Capital expenditures take up to 56% of U.S.-based miner costs, compared to 31% for Chinese miners, which suggests a competitive edge for Chinese miners that could be explained by the concentration of hardware manufacturers in China.

55% of surveyed service providers now support stablecoins, up from 11% in 2018.

An estimate of the number of crypto asset users has been updated to 101 million identified users, up from 35 million in 2018. This is due to an increase in the number of active accounts, and to more rigorous compliance with KYC procedures on the part of service providers.

Service providers operationally headquartered in North America and Europe indicate that business and institutional clients make up 30% of their customers. This figure is much lower for Asia-Pacific and Latin American firms, at 16% and 10% respectively.

Compliance with KYC/AML obligations is heterogeneous across regions. Nearly all customer accounts at European and North American service providers have been KYC’ed, whereas this is the case for only one out of two accounts at service providers based in the Middle East and Africa. The share of crypto asset-only companies that did not conduct any KYC checks at all dropped from 48% to 13% between 2018 and 2020.

46% of service providers report not being insured against any risks. 90% keep crypto asset funds in cold storage. 45% use a third-party crypto custodian as part of their cold storage system.

One of my favorite parts of the report was this chart, which color-codes the importance crypto service providers assign to various trends emerging in the industry. Stablecoins win, not surprisingly. Staking and security tokens got less interest than I expected. And the relative lack of interest in non-fungible tokens hints that the recent market buzz around the concept may be short-lived.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

This week’s sell off in equity markets felt different from previous half-hearted declines. The scope, combined with the intensifying concern in various media around the likelihood of a contested U.S. election, a disappointing vaccine and repeated lockdowns, feels more like a change of sentiment that could, in the absence of generous stimulus checks, snowball into genuine worry about the state of the global economy.

Related to this, I’ve spent some time recently wondering what will drive the stock markets after the pandemic is over. Rebuilding? Infrastrtucture hasn’t been damaged. Consumption? Many spending habits will have permanently changed. And what of all the companies that can’t support employee costs once federal aid is not on the table?

Of course there will be success stories, and of course emerging technologies will continue to present growth plays. But are the future earnings that current valuations are pointing to realistic?

Bitcoin fared better than most other assets this past week, but that’s not saying much.

This feels like a good time to revisit bitcoin’s volatility compared to gold and the S&P 500.

Source: Coin Metrics, FactSet, CoinDesk Research

Given the swings in the BTC price over the past week, it’s not surprising that volatility is edging up. Gold’s volatility, on the other hand, is edging down.

Source: CoinDesk, FactSet

To further confuse the narrative, the 60d correlation between the natural log returns of BTC and gold continues to increase, while the correlation with the S&P 500 is holding steady. For now.

CHAIN LINKS

The flow of bitcoin onto Ethereum continues to astonish – this week the market value of bitcoin that has been adapted to work on the Ethereum blockchain passed $1 billion. TAKEAWAY: I’ve written about the phenomenon of Ethereum-based bitcoin before, and am not surprised to see this level of growth. Why would anyone want to put their BTC on Ethereum, you ask? Because Ethereum-based tokens can participate in the myriad decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols that pay yields on deposits. Yes, BTC can earn a yield. There are risks – DeFi is still a young, niche application with counterparty and technology risk, as well as regulatory uncertainty. But for many, the yield and the innovation are compelling.

The most liquid bitcoin-on-Ethereum token is wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), managed by crypto custodian BitGo. There are other options, however, such as tBTC, which this week relaunched with a system that relies on a decentralized network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts.

This week alone, over $170 million was added to wBTC, according to btconethereum.com. Investment fund Three Arrows Capital accounted for almost $25 million-worth of that, setting an individual wBTC transaction record just one week after Alameda Research minted almost $22 million worth. (Update: Alameda then upped Three Arrows Capital’s transaction, and I’ve given up trying to keep up.)

Now, the concept is spreading to other blockchains: BitGo will enable wBTC on the Tron blockchain, with the aim of boosting its decentralized finance ecosystem. Tron currently has much lower fees than Ethereum – but the persistent popularity of stablecoins on Ethereum vs. Tron shows that the market on the whole doesn’t seem to mind.

The Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020, introduced this week by Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), seeks to create a federal definition of “digital commodity exchanges,” putting them in their own legal category and charging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with oversight. TAKEAWAY: If passed, this would finally establish a regulator for cryptocurrencies. So far, they’ve been languishing in no-man’s land, which has hindered market infrastructure development. Many U.S.-based institutions cannot transact on an unregulated exchange, which puts crypto exchanges out of bounds: They may be licensed, but without a regulator, they are unregulated. Federal regulation would also ease many of the burdens U.S.-based crypto exchanges face, such as the need to go state by state for permission to transact.

The European Commission has proposed a bill that would provide clarity on crypto asset definitions, rules on digital asset custody as well as details on what the relationship between token issuers and holders should be. If passed, this would turn the EU into the largest and most significant regulated space for cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world. TAKEAWAY: The regulatory clarity is coming thick and fast these days. This is good news for an asset group that promises global access. Institutional support for that global access will boost funding, infrastructure investment and, eventually, adoption.

Social Capital, a California-based investment firm that purchased bitcoin in 2013, is considering going public.TAKEAWAY: The firm, which specializes in technology startups, earlier this month filed three new Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) with the SEC, bringing his firm’s total up to six. It also announced that one of the SPACs was merging with Opendoor (his first merged with Virgin Atlantic earlier this year) and hinted in an interview that he is thinking of taking the whole firm public. If this comes to pass, it would be the first publicly traded venture capital and private equity fund manager with a significant market value to invest in cryptocurrency. It is unclear how much bitcoin Social Capital owns, but an investor letter in 2018 said that one of Social Capital’s largest investments was in bitcoin, so – considering when it was first bought – it’s probably quite a lot. Some veteran FX traders are moving into the cryptocurrency space because of its volatility. TAKEAWAY: A reminder that volatility is not necessarily bad. We tend to equate volatility with risk (I’ve written about this before), which has negative connotations – you don’t often hear about investment advisors talking about risk to the upside. But high volatility means swings up as well as swings down, and seasoned traders pride themselves on their ability to harness the upside while protecting the downside. The growth of hedging instruments and the smoother flows on market infrastructure make the volatility more manageable than back in the early days. Inexperienced traders can truly suffer, though, as volatility can turn against you at a moment’s notice.

The cryptocurrency money manager Panxora seeks to raise up to $50 million for a new hedge fund to buy digital tokens associated with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. TAKEAWAY: So far, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have been the purview of crypto enthusiasts and some professional investors chasing higher yields. This type of fund is one of the first but is unlikely to be the last that hopes to bring institutional money into the space. Whether the market’s liquidity can handle that kind of volume remains to be seen. According to crypto data provider Messari, the total reported market cap of DeFi tokens is over $5 billion, with over $600 million in 24-hr trading volume, so it can probably handle an inflow of $50 million without too much chaos. This is worth watching, though, as the next funds of this ilk might be more ambitious.

The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) has accepted its first crypto asset exchange-traded fund (ETF), Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. TAKEAWAY: The BMX is not a large stock exchange – its aggregate market cap is just under $300 million. A total of 3 million shares is available via private placement at $1,000 each. So, doing the math, this ETF – if completely sold – would multiply the market cap of the entire stock exchange by more than 10x. I don’t want to be a downer, but isn’t that a bit ambitious?

The cryptocurrency revolution steadily marches on. While it has yet to completely reshape the financial and other systems of everyday life, crypto acquisition and usage grow yearly.

There is so much to love about cryptocurrency. From its decentralized and democratic nature to the higher levels of security it can provide through the blockchain, crypto is changing the world around us.

Unfortunately, as with so many other digital world areas, hackers have found a way to exploit innocent user’s computer resources to mine cryptocurrency. This means whether you’re a diehard crypto fan or just someone trying to use Facebook and YouTube, this threat could be coming for you.

What is crypto hacking, and how can you defend against it? Find out everything you need to know here.

Understanding How Cryptocurrency Works

Before diving into cryptojacking you must understand how cryptocurrency works to get a complete picture of the threat it poses to you.

The whole system of cryptocurrency is underwritten by the blockchain. The blockchain is effectively a ledger of transactions so people can see the detailed history of bitcoin transactions.

Think of it like this—instead of sending your money through the banking system and your bank verifying the transaction, the blockchain does it instead. The blockchain is made up of a computer network that records the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the amount of crypto being sent.

The ledger is stored across multiple computers to ensure the complete accuracy and authenticity of data. In fact, this is one of the best features of crypto since if hackers do manage to break into one computer and manipulate the information, there are countless others with the true data history of the coin.

Cryptocurrency Mining

These computers are known as crypto miners. They add transaction information into the blockchains, which then goes into the blockchain.

As another security feature, these additions can only be accepted if they are correctly hashed (think secured). Doing so requires mathematical calculations that take up time and an immense amount of computer processing power.

To incentivize users to provide their computers to perform hashing tasks, crypto coin providers will provide them a reward in the form of crypto.

How much you get depends on the network and the number of other people mining. In the past, however, it wasn’t too hard to receive one full Bitcoin for assisting in these efforts. You could even use a laptop to mine crypto back in the early days.

With crypto more popular than ever, it’s a lot more complicated. Now you have to have some serious computing power as in racks of servers to make crypto mining profitable.

Enter the threat of Cryptojacking

You could be a legitimate crypto minter. That means you invest in the setup and resources. Or you could do what hackers do—hijack hundreds or even thousands of computers to mine you.

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of somebody’s laptop, desktop, or even mobile device to mine crypto. By creating a massive network of computers dispersed across the web, these hackers can use their victim’s device resources, internet, and electricity to reel in some serious profits.

Hackers tend to be subtle about this. They generally won’t try to max out one device’s resources. They’ll steal just enough that you may notice slower performance or overheating issues.

But spread out over thousands of devices, this can add up, allowing them to mine large amounts of crypto.

Why Hackers Love Cryptojacking

Hackers are increasingly turning to cryptojacking because it’s low-risk, low-investment, and an easy way to get steady and large profits.

Unlike other types of malware, like ransomware, where there is no guarantee the fraudsters will get paid, cryptojacking ensures they will make money without calling too much attention.

The Two Types of Cryptojacking

There are two main ways fraudster engage in cryptojacking:

Crypto mining malware : Hackers will trick you into downloading malware often through social engineering attacks. Once you click on the file or download, the hidden malware will launch and run quietly in the background. Since it’s often packaged in legitimate files, it’s very easy for this to go unnoticed.

: Hackers will trick you into downloading malware often through social engineering attacks. Once you click on the file or download, the hidden malware will launch and run quietly in the background. Since it’s often packaged in legitimate files, it’s very easy for this to go unnoticed. Browser-based attacks: This is a very clever attack style. In it, hackers put malicious code into a web page. This script is automatically run anytime somebody lands on the site. There’s nothing stored on your computer, but the mining will take place for as long as the browser/tab is open. Some even have pop-under windows that hide taskbars under you exit your browser.

How You Can Defend Against Cryptojacking

Crypto Hacking is a serious threat. Do you really want somebody stealing your computer’s resources, running up your electricity bill, and putting your cybersecurity at threat? Don’t forget that if they managed to get malware on your computer, there are other ways hackers can put you in danger.

Fortunately, awareness is the first step in beating cryptojackers at their game. Next, arm yourself with a VPN.

VPNs encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address. The result is you’re not only much safer but also more anonymous in the online world. That’s why VPNs are the best first line of defense against all kinds of digital threats.

Next, learn to watch out for social engineering scams. 92% of malware is distributed by email. If you know how to recognize what these attacks look like, then you’ll not only defend against cryptojacking but other cyber threats.

Finally, keep your computer and apps up to date and with the latest anti-malware software installed. This is an excellent way to keep all kinds of hackers out.

Don’t let cryptojacking take you down. Protect yourself with these highly effective cybersecurity tools now.

The new proposal could help ‘legitimize’ cryptocurrency for businesses and bring a host of benefits with it

Cryptocurrencies aren’t just the reserve of obsessed Hodlers, they have substantial advantages over traditional currencies. They are decentralized, private, and secure, and transactions can be a lot faster than those of traditional government-issued fiat currencies, available to use from anywhere at any time.

So far, however, regulation (or a lack of it) has stymied mainstream uptake. Not surprisingly, governments and players in the existing banking system are unwelcoming of payment networks that are “powered by users with no central authority or middlemen.” Many fear that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital controls, and can be used for money laundering or illegal purchases. Others are concerned over decentralized currencies’ potential to destabilize or undermine the authority or control of central banks.

READ NEXT Cryptocurrency exchanges act like banks, but not for the lawyers

Last week, the European Union announced a major step to regulating cryptocurrency assets within the bloc, which could break this deadlock and lay the groundwork for the wider uptake of the advantages of cryptocurrency by individuals and businesses, while protecting financial markets.

Considered one of the most comprehensive to be announced anywhere, the proposal from the European Commission includes aims to regulate supposed ‘stablecoins’, such as Facebook Inc.’s Libra.

“We should embrace the digital transformation proactively while mitigating any potential risks,” said executive vice president of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis.

“An innovative digital single market for finance will benefit Europeans and will be key to Europe’s economic recovery by offering better financial products for consumers and opening up new funding channels for companies.”

Under the newly proposed rules, trading platforms would need a physical presence in the EU and would become subject to capital requirements. The most important stablecoins would also be supervised by the European Banking Authority.

Following the reveal, the proposal is up for debate between the European Parliament and national governments before it becomes law. The commission has said it plans to have a framework for crypto assets in place by 2024.

Benefits for business

Many businesses are already utilizing crypto to raise funds, make transactions, and make investments. The most recent announcement by the EU will in effect contribute to ‘legitimizing’ cryptocurrency for businesses, which could stir up renewed interest. Thanks to outdated systems, bureaucracy, cross-border monetary restrictions, and little financial impetus to change the status quo, authorities and financial institutions are known to move notoriously slow when it comes to technical innovations.

Before institutions can actively embrace and promote a product, they need to understand the financial landscape in which a new asset class operates, as well as the risk factors associated with it.

A common concern for banks is if they were to sell Bitcoin to a client and it’s then traced back to an exchange hack or terrorism, it could open itself up to criminal investigations or class-action lawsuits that could ultimately cause the bank to fail. Following the aftermath of the banking crisis in 2008, meanwhile, financial institutions have traditionally been averse to taking any unnecessary risk or stepping into any kind of gray area.

Raising funds

A key benefit for businesses is the ability to raise funds by releasing their own coins to generate money from the blockchain network. A small business could issue a coin to fund an upcoming product, with early access to that product being the value behind a coin. The same approach could also be used to fund a small business without having to sacrifice ownership of the business.

Accurate valuations

Steady value has made cryptocurrency ideal for transactions. Despite market uncertainty, cryptocurrencies have held their value well and have little to no transaction fees. Bitcoin remains the most popular on the market, which is then followed by Ethereum (ETH) and XRP.

A regulated marketplace will help put an accurate valuation on a cryptocurrency’s worth. This will create a more level playing field for investors by putting real identities that can be tied to illicit behavior by authorities. This will also create a bigger investor pool and provide stability by providing liquidity, which in turn will have a knock-on effect of reducing volatility in favor of reliable long-term price predictability. This allows for more organic growth, with investors able to determine the underlying value of virtual assets more accurately.

Encourages investment

A regulated cryptocurrency could mean an expected influx of financial institutions into the entire industry. Financial institutions will hope to bring some of the most-skilled professionals in the world in the fields of banking, FinTech, and digital security, as well as mature, tested enterprise-ready solutions and infrastructure.

For small businesses, this opens new doors to diversify their investments. The yield offered by cryptocurrency is still relatively high when compared to other investment instruments. A relatively young coin like Chainlink can gain more than 2% in value, while Bitcoin fluctuates at a rate of 2-3% per day.

Due to there being hundreds of coins to choose from, there are plenty of opportunities to bank profits with certain cryptocurrency investments.

Digital marketing

A regulated market ultimately opens new doors for other industries, and in the realm of digital marketing, this might not be truer. Branded coins are not just attracting potential investors but generate plenty of hype within the community.

The crypto community is nowadays one of the largest communities you can find online and has become a lucrative audience segment for many digital marketing campaigns.

The future of cryptocurrency still hangs in the balance, however, to achieve mass adoption while protecting financial markets, regulation is essential.

Financial institutions and mainstream investors seek order in a controlled environment in which to conduct business.

That means traders can keep an eye on exchange wallets to gauge whether investors and crypto miners are getting their bitcoin into position for a possible sale – or taking balances down from the exchanges in anticipation of holding for the longer term.

The latter might be what’s happening now, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported Monday. Total balances of bitcoin on major exchanges has hit its lowest levels since November 2018. It could be an indication of bullishness among bitcoin traders.

“There’s no reason to sell now,” Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, told Shen in a phone interview. “Why would you be selling when you’re at the beginning of a wave of potential corporate treasuries and institutional investors coming in?”

Another interpretation, according to Arcane Research, is that traders are taking their bitcoin off exchanges to deploy them in the decentralized finance sector, known as DeFi. Juicy returns can be obtained from tokenizing crypto assets and depositing them as collateral in semi-automated, blockchain-based trading and lending platforms.

As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, tokenized bitcoin has become one of the largest assets on DeFi. Currently, there are more than 108,000 BTC worth some $1.1 billion minted from seven issuers, according to Dune Analytics.

That might be another bullish sign.

“Bitcoin maximalists would decry the use of bitcoin on Ethereum, arguing that it isn’t ‘real’ bitcoin,” David Derhy, an analyst for the cryptocurrency trading platform eToro, wrote Monday in an email. “I view this development as positive for the sector, as it highlights an evolution within the industry.”

Bitcoin’s upward momentum is again running out of steam near the psychological resistance of $11,000.

The cryptocurrency clocked highs near $10,950 early Monday and is currently trading near $10,850.

The cryptocurrency’s weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, has dipped below zero for the first time since March, indicating a bearish shift in the broader trend.

Similarly, the 5- and 10-week averages have produced a bearish crossover. As such, bitcoin could face chart-driven selling pressure.

On the higher side, $11,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.

A chart released by Coinmetrics highlights how Ethereum fees went on a steep ascent in the latter part of the year, coinciding quite closely with the release of Compound’s token incentive. Cumulative 2020 fees on Ethereum equalized with Bitcoin’s on Aug. 12, continuing a break-neck ascent since.

This marks a distinct change from trends in transaction fees from past years, where Bitcoin generally dominated over any other network by a wide margin. In 2019, Bitcoin came out with a five-to-one advantage in the same comparison.

Cointelegraph previously reported that Ethereum first began posting higher daily fee revenue in June. As activity increased and the average transaction fee with it, total revenue began skyrocketing. Between August and September, Ethereum began breaking previous records and quickly became unusable for some participants.

The culprit is most likely the boom of decentralized finance and yield farming, though stablecoin transfers and some alleged Ponzi schemes also make up a significant portion of block space usage on Ethereum.

The current state of affairs is likely to wind down somewhat as DeFi euphoria settles, similarly to what happened in the crypto market at large in 2018.

It’s interesting to note that Ethereum fee revenue briefly exceeded the block rewards for a few particularly high-activity days in the past few months. Overall, fees have crept up to steadily over more than 10% of total issuance since May — a threshold achieved only a few times in the coin’s history.

This may be particularly valuable for ETH holders in light of the EIP-1559 proposal, which seeks to introduce a fee burn mechanism. While the specifics of the implementation imply that in periods of high activity there may still be bidding wars that directly benefit miners, high activity could lower the effective issuance rate to a significant extent.

For Bitcoin, raising transaction fees to cover existing issuance is crucial for its long-term future, since block rewards will eventually expire. However, the cryptocurrency space in the past two years has begun trending away from Bitcoin-centric use cases to stablecoins and DeFi. While Bitcoin usage remains high, losing dominance to other blockchains may prove catastrophic for its long-term prospects.",,https://www.coindesk.com/ey-enterprise-procurement-ethereum-blockchain,"Disclosure

Diversification has always been an integral part of smart risk management. Allocating between risk-on and risk-off assets to hedge against undue volatility is one of the oldest tricks in trading. However, not even the lauded 60/40 rule can protect a portfolio against systematic risk.

For decades, hedge funds have sought an asset that can protect against such undiversifiable hazards—an asset unperturbed by volatility in the wider market. For many, cryptocurrency is the answer.

Regular Diversification Won't Save You

As coronavirus-ushered financial friction continues to filter through the markets, systematic risk, or undiversifiable risk, as it's sometimes known, is precisely what investors are facing. Systematic risk essentially acts as a domino effect, rippling through markets and taking them down one by one. Between global quantitative easing and a potential stock market bubble, the chances of market-wide breakdown are reaching a fever pitch. On top of this, most traditional assets, including stocks and bonds, remain correlated—meaning that even the highly extolled 60/40 rule can't shield investors in the event of system-wide failure.

Hedge funds have touted the 60/40 rule for decades. The concept advises investors to allot a respective 60/40 percent split between higher-risk investments such as stocks, which historically yields a better return and lowers risk assets, including government bonds, which are traditionally safer but typically provide a smaller yield. The theory goes that a combination of high and low-risk assets will smoothen out volatility and produce a more significant profit. But amid the current economic fallout and a highly correlated market—there is little refuge should the worst occur.

The 60/40 rule originated from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a paradigm stipulating that investors should allocate capital among multiple assets—regardless of their risk-return profile—to maximize return and minimize risk. MPT is based on the premise that markets are more efficient than their investors and leans on diversification to spread uncertainty. In other words, the theory advises against putting all your eggs in one basket.

But, as noted, some hazards remain uncontrollable, particularly within traditional asset classes. But what about the not-so-traditional asset market?

Putting crypto in its place

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, together with a new trend known as decentralized finance, has helped to turn digital currencies into this year’s best-performing asset by far. The entire crypto market cites a 71% advance year-to-date (YTD). The impetus behind the market's move up comes primarily from the unconventional global posture toward monetary and fiscal policy.

In the U.S., this stance is particularly noticeable. U.S. national debt has ramped up to $26.7 trillion as of August—a $6.7 trillion increase since January. Moreover, the U.S. fed is sticking to its dovish attitude, opting to keep interest rates flat for the next few years. As such, more investors have been eyeing the crypto market as a hedge against potential inflation.

In February, speaking on CNBC, Virgin Galactic chairman and veteran investor Chamath Palihapitiya argued that everyone should hold 1% of their assets in bitcoin, as it stands as a hedge against monetary devaluation.

By May, Wall Street luminary Paul Tudor Jones was singing the same tune. Within a letter penned to his investors, Jones advocated for exposure to bitcoin amid an ""unprecedented expansion of money.""

More recently, Microstrategy, the world's largest publicly-traded business intelligence company, upped the ante on both Palihapitiya and Jones, swapping out the Greenback for a sum total of $425 million in bitcoin. Much like the others, the Microstrategy's CEO, Micheal Saylor, argued that while quantitative easing and other macroeconomic factors have a depreciating effect on fiat, bitcoin remained unscathed.

Indeed, while fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar can be arbitrarily inflated on the whims of a few, bitcoin, much like gold, has a finite supply and remains uninfluenced by the same kind of macro risks plaguing the broader financial markets.

But the desire for crypto exposure didn't pop up overnight. Analysts, hedge funds, and investors have been advocating an allocation in crypto for years. There is a myriad of research on the effectiveness of the asset class within a broader portfolio.

In 2018, a study undertaken by crypto fund manager Bitwise Asset Management found that a portfolio consisting of 5% bitcoin, 38% bonds, and 57% stocks increased returns twofold compared to the traditional 60/40 split over 4 years.

Another related study from the National Bureau of Economic Research delved into the role of bitcoin within portfolio diversification, assessing its risk-return and comparing it to traditional assets. Researchers submitted that regardless of an investor's risk appetite, a minimum allocation of 1% in an overall portfolio was prudent.

Moreover, the study observed that a higher allocation resulted in better overall returns, ultimately concluding that based on bitcoin's Sharpe —a measure of risk-adjusted return—the ideal bitcoin allocation stands at around 6%.

Not bitcoin alone

While many tend to lean toward bitcoin when it comes to crypto exposure, a maximalist mindset may be just as detrimental as sticking solely to traditional assets.

Despite approval from some of the biggest companies, hedge funds, and investment gurus, bitcoin has actually underperformed compared to some altcoins. For example, while BTC is up an admirable 46% this year, Chainlink—a token powering a decentralized price oracle network—is currently up around 350% YTD. And Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also beating bitcoin with a 140% YTD rise.

The problem remains that while bitcoin enjoys relative legitimacy, having established itself over the course of a decade, countless altcoins remain relatively unproven. There are leagues of cryptocurrencies, each touting disruptive use cases and generally promising a great deal. But evaluating this can prove extremely tricky.

In order to do so, one needs to practice careful due diligence with what they place money in. Evaluating a cryptocurrency based on its price history, liquidity, and use case are an essential part of the picture when looking for exposure to the market. Beyond the technical indicators, one should also consider the fundamental factors such as the problem a given cryptoasset is solving as well as the team behind it. Get it wrong, and the risk can be immense. Get it right, however, and the rewards will speak for themselves.

The Cryptocurrency Risk & Compliance Survey, produced in conjunction by the British think tank RUSI and the industry body ACAMS, showed staggeringly different attitudes to digital assets depending on whether the respondent was involved in the industry or not. It found:

23% of government respondents see the likes of Bitcoin as an opportunity, compared with 80% of crypto industry

89% of governments are concerned about crypto being used on the dark web, while just 50% of crypto industry respondents felt the same

88% of financial institutions are worried about cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering purposes, against 57% of those who specialize in digital currencies

9% of financial institutions say exchanges are prepared to deal with cybercrime, but 48% of respondents from the crypto industry say they are

20% of financial institutions agree that crypto transactions offer greater levels of transparency, while 83% of digital asset specialists believe this to be the case

These statistics suggest one of two things, neither of which are particularly palatable. Either the crypto industry is overly complacent about the risk of digital assets being used illegally, or governments and financial institutions are ill informed about how the sector works.

It’s highly likely that the truth falls somewhere in between. Although the Sept. 29 report notes that criminals represent 1% of all cryptocurrency transactions—indicating that the threat isn’t as sizeable as some may think—it’s still true that digital assets have appeal among terrorist organizations and money launderers, with the likes of Monero growing particularly popular among the seedy merchants found in darknet markets. The crypto sector’s confidence in its own abilities also doesn’t bode well given how it has faced repeated hacks, with KuCoin losing digital assets worth $150 million in an audacious hack mere days ago.

“The crypto industry appears to have a great amount of confidence in their own abilities to counter and detect risk, whereas government doesn’t have nearly as much faith,” said Kayla Izenman, a RUSI research analyst who co-authored the report. “Bridging this gap is essential, as all sectors agree that the use of cryptocurrency is on the rise, but we know there’s no clear consensus on domestic regulatory action. This risks opening the door to illicit activities.”

Where this leaves crypto

This survey suggests there are substantial levels of distrust among governments and financial institutions, which means it’s all the more important to understand how they make decisions relating to crypto regulation. Across all of the groups polled, 56% said they seek precedent based on what other governments have done in the past—indicating that early adopters have a big opportunity to shape best practices in the future. This was one of the few questions where government and crypto industry respondents appeared to be in agreement.

However, the gloomy figures don’t suggest that cryptocurrencies should be written off altogether.

As the report notes: “Overall, respondents are more likely to agree than disagree that in five years, cryptocurrency will be an effective tool for financial inclusion… The respondents still believe that the main use of cryptocurrency in five years will be investment and speculation, but day-to-day payments ranks second, with illicit purposes moved to third. The cryptocurrency industry specifically said that day-to-day payments will become the main use of cryptocurrency.”

The findings could give a boost to the governments that have been early trailblazers in cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. As reported by Modern Consensus, China recently said that its digital yuan is now ready for deployment, while the European Commission is pressing ahead with plans to regulate cryptocurrencies and provide “legal clarity” to the sector.

How the survey worked

The study, performed in conjunction with the well-respected British polling company YouGov, received responses from 566 individuals in June and July of this year. There was little difference in attitudes based on geography, but the report’s authors said attitudes did vary depending on what the participant did for a living. Almost half of the respondents worked for financial institutions, 24% worked in government, 10% in crypto, and the rest in private sector roles—such as at law firms or insurance companies.

Although 96% of all those surveyed said they were familiar with Bitcoin, awareness dramatically dropped when it came to Ethereum (66%,) Litecoin and XRP (44%,) and Monero (32%.)

It is worth noting that this report did not include stablecoins such as Tether and Libra in its definition of a cryptocurrency—and overall, stablecoins were regarded as far less risky than the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.",2020-09-29 22:36:25+00:00,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/84270/banks-governments-and-crypto-industry-divided-on-cryptocurrency-risk,"Source: Acams

Divided opinion on the perceived risk of cryptocurrency including the links between cryptocurrency and illicit purposes were among the key findings of a global survey -- the second commissioned by RUSI and ACAMS in partnership with YouGov – and based on 566 unique responses from across the global financial and cryptocurrency industries, including cryptocurrency exchanges, financial regulators and financial intelligence units.

While the survey reflects doubts about the abilities of government, the cryptocurrency industry is ‘much more confident in their own tools and preparedness than other audiences,’ to mitigate potential risks in the sector.



Criminal activity remains top of mind for both governments and crypto industry professionals, with 70% of total respondents highlighting this as a concern. When asked to select any areas of concern, respondents overall indicated they are worried about the use of cryptocurrency for money-laundering (84%), on the dark web (84%), for procurement of illicit goods (83%) by sanctioned actors (82%), by terrorist organizations (79%), to fund human trafficking (76%), and in fraudulent initial coin offering (75%).



However, the survey demonstrates a disconnect between governments and the industry on the nature of risks posed by cryptocurrency and ongoing concerns over the use of cryptocurrency for criminal activity. The cryptocurrency industry was notably less worried about each of the listed risks, considering only sanctions evasion as a high priority.



The survey finds respondents split over whether they consider cryptocurrency a risk or an opportunity - with significant gaps between government and financial industry perceptions and those directly involved in the crypto industry. The cryptocurrency industry largely believes that cryptocurrency transactions offer more transparency than traditional financial transactions, and that transactions are compatible with sanctions screening and compliance, while financial institutions and government disagreed.



While cryptocurrency professionals are aware of the risks in their industry, other actors such as the media, politicians and the general public are less aware of the risks. Overall, there is a far higher likelihood (78%) that institutions will seek guidance from non-governmental organisations such as FATF, trade bodies, and blockchain associations, than from governments. Respondents of the survey are also of the view that governments are more likely to defer to international bodies (45%) over their own regulatory systems (35%).



Kayla Izenman, research analyst with the Centre for Financial Crime and Security at RUSI and co-author of the survey said, “ The crypto industry appears to have a great amount of confidence in their own abilities to counter and detect risk, whereas government doesn’t have nearly as much faith. Bridging this gap is essential, as all sectors agree that the use of cryptocurrency is on the rise, but we know there’s no clear consensus on domestic regulatory action. This risks opening the door to illicit activities.”



Rick Mcdonell, executive director, ACAMS and former executive secretary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and co-author of the survey said, “The results of this survey give a unique global insight into how respondents from governments, financial institutions and the crypto industry itself think about cryptocurrency: its potential and its risks. Their views are well worth noting as policy making and regulatory enforcement continue to take shape around the world.”",2020-09-29 15:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies/financial-firms-and-governments-deeply-sceptical-of-cryptocurrencies-survey-idINKBN26K2IF,"LONDON (Reuters) - Financial firms and governments overwhelmingly see cryptocurrencies as risky, a major survey found on Tuesday, with the potential for bitcoin and other digital tokens for use in money laundering and sanctions busting among the chief worries.

Around 60% of respondents from financial firms, government and the private sector alike to the survey by the Royal United Services Institute think-tank and the Association of Anti-Money Laundering Specialists said cryptocurrencies were a risk rather than an opportunity. Illicit usage was the major concern.

The findings, one of the most detailed efforts yet to map out mainstream global views towards cryptocurrencies, lay bare the depth of scepticism towards the emerging tech.

They suggest an uphill struggle for the crypto industry to achieve wider acceptance, even as countries across the world grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. The European Union will introduce new rules for some cryptocurrencies by 2024, documents showed last week.

The perception of criminal use of cryptocurrencies is deep-rooted, the survey found. Nearly 90% of respondents from financial firms said they were worried about crypto being used to launder money. Over 80% were worried about sanctioned actors using digital coins to circumvent the formal financial system.

“All respondents accept that cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to criminals,” the survey’s authors said.

The extent to which crypto is used for crime is unclear, with past research by major blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis this year putting the rate as low as 1% of all transactions.

Still, digital currencies are popular with cyber-criminals, as the July hack of major Twitter users to reap bitcoin shows.

Cryptocurrencies have also been used for the funding of militant groups. The U.S. Justice Department said last month it had targeted efforts by the military wing of Hamas, al Qaeda and Islamic State to raise funds via cryptocurrencies.

Only a fifth of respondents from financial and other private firms said they viewed digital coins as an opportunity, the research found. Among the potential benefits cited was the possibility crypto could extend access to financial services.

Kevin Zhou, co-founder of San Francisco-based Galois Capital, told CoinDesk his firm is now bullish on bitcoin and expects the upward altcoin trend of the last few months to revert into several months of downward price action.

During months of sustained excitement over new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and various altcoins, bitcoin became “under owned,” according to Kyle Davies, a prominent DeFi investor and co-founder of Three Arrows Capital.

Bitcoin is down so far in September, dropping more than 10%. But with a subsiding of the DeFi craze and yields “collapsing,” Davies said he expects investor interest to pivot from altcoins toward bitcoin.

Two futures indices recently launched by FTX reflect the recent cooling off in the altcoin market. After consistent double-digit percentage gains since April, the exchange’s Decentralized Finance and S**tcoin indexes have both dropped by double digits this month.

In 2020, altcoins with lower market capitalizations significantly outperformed BTC and ether ETH thanks in part to global financial markets recovering and stabilizing “a bit,” said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari.

Also aided by the DeFi and yield farming frenzies, most of the significant altcoin returns started in the second half of the year as tokens like COMP and YFI came onto the market.

As Q4 approaches and returns for altcoins have started to cool off, some professional cryptocurrency traders are betting on significant upside for bitcoin amid continued downside for altcoins.

First, up to 40% of customers that pay with crypto are new to the merchant. Second, purchase amounts are twice that of credit card purchases. Third, crypto is less expensive than card cards, and lastly, there are no fraud-related chargebacks. The study, commissioned by BitPay, examines the cost savings and business benefits enabled by accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using BitPay.

Forrester’s research reveals that interviewed merchants who integrate BitPay saw an average return on investment of 327%, which was no surprise to BitPay CEO and Co-Founder Stephen Pair. “We believe the Forrester study confirms what we’ve known for some time now,” Pair said. “Accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through BitPay saves merchants considerably on fees, and unlocks a whole new customer base.”

According to the study, “While adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is still emerging,” the merchants interviewed “have captured significant benefits at relatively low risk and cost.”

Specifically, the study determined four ways in which merchants benefit from the addition of accepting cryptocurrency through BitPay. “Generating new sales by attracting first-time buyers who prefer paying with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies” lead Forrester’s list. This is followed by “increasing the size of transactions because buyers who pay with cryptocurrency tend to spend more than other customers.” Third, merchants paid lower transaction costs, the study continued, “since BitPay transaction fees are lower than those for other payment types.” Finally, the addition of BitPay as a payment option reduced risk “by greatly lessening or eliminating issues related to fraud or mistakes.”

Further, citing a reported increase in online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic and a recent survey, 11% of consumer respondents said they used a digital payment method for the first time. Forrester notes “BitPay allowed merchants to serve and support cryptocurrency adopters better and to provide all customers added options while shopping.” BitPay and Forrester Consulting are hosting a webinar October 15 to share details from the report.

Forrester is a leading global research and advisory firm in both influence and reach. Their proprietary research and unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 690,000 consumers and business leaders worldwide.

As a pioneer and leader in global blockchain payments, BitPay works with merchants and businesses to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The ability to accept cryptocurrency expands opportunities into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical. By adding cryptocurrency to payment options, businesses reduce high fees from traditional payment methods and increase payment transparency and efficiency. Using BitPay, a business can receive settlement the next business day directly to its bank account in its local fiat currency like the U.S. Dollars or Euros. There is no cryptocurrency price volatility or risk to the business. As a push transaction, the customer sends the exact amount of cryptocurrency needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards. Unlike the high cost of credit cards, BitPay charges 1% to approve the cryptocurrency transaction and manage settlement. BitPay enables transactions from any computer or mobile device making it convenient for customers.

The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) of New Zealand has requested that crypto companies in the country hand over their customers’ personal details, cryptocurrency asset values as well as the type of asset held.

According to a September 28 report by Radio New Zealand, the tax agency says it wants to improve its understanding of the digital asset industry “so we can work out how best to help taxpayers meet their income tax obligations.”

New Zealand firms might not have legal grounds to refuse the request, says the report. In the island nation, virtual currencies are treated as a form of property, just like in the U.S. Tax is paid with every sale, trade, exchange, or lending activity. Crypto mining and staking are also taxed.

The IRD’s latest move drew criticism from industry participants. Janine Grainger, chief executive officer of New-Zealand-based Easy Crypto, told Radio New Zealand that the requirement to share customer details was “heartbreaking”.

She noted how the tax authority’s move was an attempt to shore up its coffers from a rapidly growing local crypto industry, but emphasized that “privacy is really important to us”. Grainger opined:

While many people might think ‘I have nothing to hide therefore, what do I care?’ the point of privacy isn’t to aid people who have something to hide, it’s to ensure we have a fair, open and free society.

Regulators throughout the world are moving to tighten their control on the cryptocurrency industry. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been sending warning letters to crypto investors seeking clarity about whether they had reported their transactions correctly.

Understandably, enthusiasts in the industry are anxious to see this technology live up to its promise of empowering consumers, accelerating cross-border payments and bridging the financial inclusion gap for the under- and unbanked.

The reality is that today, its scope is limited. From what little data we have available about cryptocurrency adoption, we see that the pool of active users is relatively small in size and scope — largely millennial and largely male.

Related: Crypto could save millennials from the economy that failed them

Some countries have proven to be trendsetters; for example, one survey showed that 32% of respondents in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, said they’ve used or owned cryptocurrency. To put that into perspective, only 7% said the same in the United States and 8% in China.

In part, this limited adoption can be attributed to the fact that today’s products are designed for users who know what they’re doing. It’s designed for people who know or are willing to learn the hoops they need to jump through to take their financial assets from fiat into crypto and back again and the benefits of doing so.

Crypto utility — that allows people to use it in their daily routine — will come from putting in the time to develop the right foundational infrastructure. This infrastructure will enable some of the most powerful crypto use cases, such as hedging inflation in volatile economies, enabling remittance and cross-border solutions, paying bills, and charging for goods and services as a merchant.

Stablecoins — tokens backed by fiat currencies — are essential to that infrastructure; they create a bridge between the digital and physical worlds, between virtual and physical value. They make digital currency useful so that they can be quickly and efficiently traded, exchanged, saved and spent — no matter where you are in the world. They represent the promise of blockchain technology.

But stablecoins won’t be useful on their own. They need a simple platform that makes it easy for consumers to use digital assets. Many of today’s platforms are designed for traders, sophisticated investors and experienced crypto adopters, not your average retail users. Driving greater blockchain adoption will rely on creating platforms that are accessible and familiar to consumers so they can trust in connecting their digital and physical assets. With mainstream consumers in mind, platforms that obfuscate the blockchain back-end should be designed in a way that is intuitive and integrates customers’ current digital habits.

Blockchain for business

That last component is essential for building the right infrastructure for greater blockchain adoption. However, it nevertheless requires a business-to-customer focus, as well as business-to-business. Blockchain infrastructure should be readily available and easy to integrate for businesses.

In its most recent analysis of the blockchain landscape, Big Four audit firm Deloitte argues that the appeal and sustainability of this technology hinge on “its use of digital assets and the roles those assets will play in the future of commerce.” To get there, it requires making crypto and crypto wallets business-friendly.

With digital payments on the rise, both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar — or, more generally, online and offline — businesses already have to adapt quickly to new payment methods. To incentivize them to see blockchain and innovations like stablecoins as a compelling addition (or alternative), there needs to be the right infrastructure, such as one-stop API endpoints so shops and businesses can offer crypto payment methods without bearing a significant operational burden.

Building infrastructure with B2B in mind and creating the ecosystem to support it ultimately drive greater consumer adoption because it means blockchain technology is available where consumers use it, delivering portable, universal money that can be used across business platforms.

The momentum is here to move blockchain technology into the mainstream. In the same Deloitte survey, 89% of respondents said that they believe digital assets will be very or somewhat important to their industries in the next three years. Now it’s up to us to build this technology to get the infrastructure right and prove that blockchain can live up to its promise.

Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Thanks to the lower processing fees, thanks to the fact that bitcoins are not connected to banks and other financial institutions, brought about the popularity of cryptocurrencies. That’s only a reason plus to choose cryptocurrencies over conventional payment methods. The early years of bitcoins have seen a bigger focus on the financial side of bitcoins, while today’s world is more concerned about the technological side of it that offers way too many features to take into consideration.

Bitcoins have many advantages for sure, and there is a reason why cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity, especially among the newer generations. Since the interest in cryptocurrencies is growing, it comes as natural that investors and bitcoin users need online platforms to learn about cryptocurrencies and the latest news from the cryptocurrencies world.

Recent Development and the Future of Cryptocurrencies

The future of bitcoins depends heavily on the developments in the financial world. Technology also plays a big role in the future development of cryptocurrencies because cryptocurrencies are, after all, digital currencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zcash, are some of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies worldwide. Since blogging is a very powerful weapon to make information accessible to people across the world, it doesn’t come as a surprise that there are blogs sharing news from the cryptocurrency world.

Blogs are effective tools to communicate with people and share recent news.

This week the research and analysis team Coin Metrics published a report on how decentralized finance (defi) is “fueling Ethereum’s growth.” Meanwhile, the researchers also highlighted that Ethereum’s cumulative transaction fees in 2020 are now over $350 million and more than double the aggregated total of Bitcoin’s network fees.

Coin Metrics researchers and Nate Maddrey published a new report that discusses Ethereum’s defi evolution and the growth the blockchain has seen this year. However, with the new demand Coin Metrics highlights that ETH fees have “changed dramatically” and the authors note “high gas prices are becoming the new norm.”

A few defi project launches contributed to the dramatic rise in network fees including UNI, SUSHI, YAM, and YFI. The trading of the new tokens has been more prevalent on decentralized exchange (dex) platforms and because swaps are onchain this created a fee market. “This can lead to escalating transaction fees as users compete to be first in line for a trade,” the report emphasizes.

“ETH median transaction fee hit a new all-time high of $8.25 on September 2nd following the launch of SUSHI,” the study’s author adds.

On Twitter, the Coin Metric’s team published a chart that shows Ethereum network fees this year are double the size of BTC’s 2020 fees. “Ethereum Total Transaction Fees during 2020 are now over $350m and more than twice Bitcoin’s,” the team’s Twitter account wrote. “By comparison, this time last year, cumulative Bitcoin Transaction Fees were $135M and Ethereum Transaction Fees were $27M,” the researchers added.

The report says that distributed ledger network fees are a “double-edged sword.” Essentially users are paying higher fees but miners are gathering all the revenue and in turn, the hashrate has increased exponentially. “As a result, Ethereum’s hash rate is climbing towards all-time highs— This is a good sign for Ethereum, as network security is critical for the long-term health and success of the blockchain.”

Although, the researchers underline that higher gas fees can make the ETH chain “prohibitively expensive” for a certain fraction of users. This can tip the scales for Ethereum whales who can swap large sums of tokens while smaller players could face a barrier to entry. “Ethereum’s median transfer value has increased to hundreds of dollars since the rise of defi, signalling that the network is shifting towards larger players,” the report points out.

CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group , which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups",2020-09-30 11:40:54+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kucoin-hack-unpacked-more-crypto-possibly-stolen-than-first-feared,"Cybercriminals have continued to come up with new, innovative attack vectors that a lot of prominent crypto platforms are still falling prey to. For example, Johnny Lyu, the CEO of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, stated on Sept. 26 that the exchange had been on the receiving end of a major hack that resulted in the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 hot wallets being affected. Commenting on the hack, Charlie Cai, the media manager at KuCoin, told Cointelegraph:

“Following the incident, KuCoin is acting quickly and transparently to deal with it. We are trying our best to mitigate the impact of the incident by working with many blockchain projects, security firms and crypto exchanges.”

In all, it’s estimated that KuCoin lost upward of $200 million in customer funds. However, despite the security breach, the price of most premier cryptos, as well as DeFi tokens, barely showcased any negative action despite the fact that major hacks, such as this one, have traditionally resulted in market-wide sell-offs.

On a more technical front, Cai highlighted that a total of 130 million of the stolen digital tokens had already been secured or in the process of being recovered by the KuCoin security team. In this regard, Cai further stated that Tether (USDT) had successfully frozen a total of 22 million USDT stablecoins that were compromised while Velo Labs, too, announced that it will redeploy and replace each of the VELO tokens that were transferred as part of the heist. He added: “The 122 million VELO tokens (about $75.7 million) that were affected will be invalidated.”

Similarly, some of the other tokens that the company claims to have secured since the matter came to public notice include Silent Notary (SNTR), Covesting (COV), Orion Protocol (ORN), KardiaChain (KAI), NOIA Network (NOIA) and Opacity (OPQ).

Red flags addressed by KuCoin

Earlier this year in March, KuCoin was in the midst of a number of controversies. The crypto exchange was facing the possibility of a class-action lawsuit that claimed KuCoin provided its customers with “false and/or misleading statements.” Similarly, as part of another suit — Chase Williams v. KuCoin — it was alleged that the exchange was dealing unlicensed securities, which is illegal.

Furthermore, around the same time period, the KuCoin team announced to the world that it would be undergoing a massive corporate restructuring that saw the firm change its trademark from one Seychelles-registered entity to another. Not only that, but the firm also appointed a new director who previously had no major role at the exchange. It’s still unclear, meanwhile, as to where exactly KuCoin’s actual headquarters are located.

Based on the aforementioned findings, people have started to question the legitimacy of KuCoin’s operations, with some even going as far as saying that the platform might be one big exit scam. Addressing these concerns, Cai stated: “KuCoin a genuine platform backed by famous VCs. As early as 2018, we got an investment of $20 million from IDG and Matrix Partners. IDG is very ‘picky’ when investing in crypto exchanges.”

Cai then proceeded to highlight KuCoin’s cash flow streams, claiming that in August 2020 alone, $13.35 billion was traded via the company’s spot trading platform, while $13.51 billion was traded on KuCoin’s futures platform.

Security experts weigh in on the matter

To gain a more holistic view of the entire situation, Cointelegraph reached out to John Jefferies, the chief financial analyst at CipherTrace — a crypto-focused security firm. He pointed out that most of the cryptocurrencies stolen from KuCoin were ERC-20 tokens that can be easily laundered through DeFi protocols.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that following the KuCoin hack, the miscreant proceeded to transfer thousands of dollars worth of Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX) to Uniswap — the largest decentralized exchange by total value locked. It’s estimated that the hackers transferred at least $1.2 million in SNX tokens through four separate transactions. On the subject, Jefferies stated:

“This was the first high profile case of a DEX, Uniswap, being used as a money mixer. Unlike centralized exchanges, a DEX can’t freeze funds — only specific projects can. Another significant impact here is that the theft of the tokens directly impacted the firms of these stolen tokens, such as Crypterium and Tether because the hack included CRPT tokens and Tether on both EOS and Ethereum blockchains.”

Madeleine Kennedy, senior director of communications at Chainalysis — a global cryptocurrency analytics company — pointed out that her firm has found that more than $275 million in crypto funds have most likely been compromised, which makes this one of the largest hacks of a cryptocurrency exchange in recorded history. Additionally, Chainalysis announced that it was expanding its presence across the APAC region in the aftermath of the hack.

Providing her take on how exactly the hackers were able to successfully facilitate this operation, Kennedy pointed out that they attempted to swap as many ERC-20 tokens as possible at decentralized exchanges before the funds were frozen by the smart contracts or forked to reverse the transactions:

“Some funds were deposited to exchanges, some to coin swapping services, and more to DEXs, but much of the funds remain unspent. Relevant addresses are labeled in Chainalysis Reactor, KYT and Kryptos, and we are continuing to monitor their movements.”

A laid-back attitude?

Despite the major strides that have been made by crypto security researchers over the past couple of years, platforms like KuCoin’s still fall victim to such attacks. However, this latest hack raises a concern as some may question if the crypto industry is doing enough to protect itself.

Jefferies pointed out that, as things stand, only the largest exchanges in the world have the security maturity of traditional financial institutions, which are typically subject to security rules and audits. In this regard, he firmly believes that until smaller virtual asset service providers are able to display the same level of rigor as their financial service counterparts, it would not be uncommon to see such types of incidents taking place. Elucidating his thoughts on the matter:

“Trusted VASPs such as Bitgo, Coinbase, and Bitgo have undergone the grueling System and Organization Control, SOC2, audit which includes security, confidentiality, processing integrity, privacy and availability.”

It’s worth mentioning that over the course of the last few years, the security industry has developed several security standards to enable customers to decide who to trust with their assets. Auditing procedures such as SOC2 and ISO 27001 provide rigorous external validation of technologies and processes. Binance and Crypto.com, for example, claim to adopt ISO 27001.

On the subject, Dyma Budorin, a co-founder and the CEO of Hacken — a crypto-oriented cybersecurity firm — told Cointelegraph that a majority of exchanges today are like black boxes, i.e., no one knows how their private keys are managed: “Only a few crypto exchanges like Kraken, Gemini and Binance are investing a lot of money to prove proper internal controls over their personal private keys management protocols.”

A similar opinion is shared by Tom Albright, the CEO of Bittrex Global — a cryptocurrency exchange — who believes that too many exchanges these days treat security as an inconvenience, adding:

“As more and more mainstream investors get involved in crypto, there will be more vulnerable participants in the ecosystem, and exchanges have to do even more to protect these customers and help them protect themselves.”",,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/30/2101449/0/en/Crypto-Millions-Lotto-named-Official-Online-Lottery-Partner-of-Serie-A-Club-Atalanta-B-C.html,"LONDON, Sept. 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via CryptoCurrencyWire -- Crypto Millions Lotto, the world’s biggest digital lottery, has been named as the Official Online Lottery Partner of Italian Serie A club Atalanta B.C.



It’s the first-ever partnership between an online lottery and a Serie A club. A coming together of two organisations, rising stars in different industries, that share the same bold approach.

Both organisations are known for punching above their weight. Crypto Millions Lotto disrupts traditional lotteries by offering jackpots many times larger than their more established national competitors. Atalanta B.C. have established themselves as a top performer, finishing third in Serie A last season, ahead of some the world’s best-known clubs.

To demonstrate the pioneering approach of this partnership, one of the major steps it will take is to bring the world’s most widely used alternative currency, Bitcoin, into the mainstream.

Commenting on the partnership, Crypto Millions Lotto CEO Sulim Malook said, “We are delighted to have found a partner that has the same disruptive approach as us. With their outstanding performances in Serie A, and having established themselves on the world stage, Atalanta B.C. were an obvious choice of partner for us. This is going to be an exciting year for us both. We are planning to add a number of new lotteries to our site plus the ability to play using credit cards, whilst Atalanta B.C. will be mixing it with Europe’s elite clubs as they challenge for the Champions League again. We’re big football fans and we’ll be supporting them all the way.”

Romano Zanforlin, Commercial Director of Atalanta B.C., said, “We’re excited to partner with Crypto Millions Lotto, an ambitious company that is keen to increase its exposure with the help of Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio’s brand and global reach. We look forward to developing our relationship, which will also see our brand reach new audiences in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.”

But that raises a tricky question: The likes of Amazon and Google, whose processing largely takes place within directly owned and controlled data centers, are able to contract clean energy with relative ease and precision. But who do you ask for if you want to make Bitcoin greener?

Announced Wednesday, Energy Web, a non-profit focused on decentralized approaches to decarbonizing the grid, wants to show how a large blockchain platform can switch to a zero-carbon footprint. To start with, the organization is teaming up with San Francisco-based Ripple and the XRP Ledger Foundation.

Ripple’s support of this venture is intended to open the door to other blockchains with more energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin, said Jesse Morris, Energy Web’s chief commercial officer.

To make all this possible, the non-profit has released an open-source app called EW Zero that makes it easy for individuals, businesses or even entire blockchain ecosystems to make the transition. This initial deployment uses energy attribute certificates (EACs) from renewable energy sources to decarbonize electricity, the companies said.

“Blockchains are a massive energy hog and a lot of that electricity is not coming from wind, solar, hydro or other sustainable facilities,” said Morris. “So we have been thinking for a while now about how we could help the crypto industry decarbonize blockchains, given the distributed nature of the technology.”

First, Ripple

In the case of Ripple, a 500-person fintech company focused on crypto-powered banking, there is an obvious starting point when it comes to reducing the firm’s carbon footprint. Moreover, Ripple uses a consensus system quite unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining, an algorithm that by definition must burn through a ton of electricity. (At last count, the top five PoW blockchains currently use up to 170 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year – more than the state of New York.)

As such, bitcoin isn’t really comparable to something like pre-mined XRP running on Ripple, which many would argue comprises much more of a centralized system.

Presented with these observations, Ken Weber, Ripple’s head of social impact, said in this case it would be beneficial to put technology-based tribal differences aside and adopt more of an “all in this together” approach.

“It’s early days for all these currencies, which right now have a tiny share of global finance, but further down the line [green energy adoption] is gonna be much more difficult to reverse engineer,” said Weber. “We wanted to help make it easy to adopt these practices. This is not a proprietary wish on Ripple’s part; it’s a whole system wish. As with other social change movements, the idea is not to make anybody feel bad or shamed, but to give them a means to do this that is reasonable, beneficial and participatory.”

Crypto ESG

Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, which identifies trends in cryptocurrencies, said carbon offsetting is happening at the level of crypto exchanges looking to do business with traditional financial institutions that follow environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) mandates.

“Ripple is leveraging the fact that people associate heavy energy consumption with blockchains, but that’s only really proof-of-work,” said de Vries. “With Bitcoin, you’re talking about an extreme carbon footprint of 300 kilograms per transaction. I haven’t done the math on Ripple, but it’s gonna be closer to a Visa transaction, which is 0.4 grams per transaction.”

Nonetheless, this is a step in the right direction for a relatively young industry that could become one of the first to be carbon-neutral, said Energy Web’s Morris. In the same way that large corporates use certificates to decarbonize complex supply chains, blockchain users can purchase certificates from different places around the world (EW Zero also uses a blockchain system to track and account for these certificates).

“Imagine in the future having a wallet interacting with some blockchain, and as a part of that wallet you can actually increase your transaction fee just a bit and you’ve just contributed to decarbonizing the blockchain by purchasing a certificate somewhere,” said Morris. “Or if you are a bitcoin miner in a mining pool, you’re also able to use this application to directly purchase certificates in a specific part of the world.”

The impetus to give this is a go is two-fold, said Energy Web CEO Walter Kok.

“Firstly, on the supply side, it will be useful to hook up existing green energy producers already servicing Bitcoin, which might have an overcapacity of green energy,” Kok said, adding:",2020-09-30 13:00:05+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/us-regulators-hit-trademining-operator-with-crypto-fraud-charges/,"The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) is following through on its promise to crack down on cryptocurrency fraud. Today, the TSSB ordered Devon Tyler Shigaki and his company TradeMining Inc to cease operations immediately, alleging the Washington resident operates a fraudulent investment tied to cryptocurrency trading software.

In addition to the false representations, the commission contends that Devon personally claimed he has experience of many years in actual trading when in fact he was nothing but a criminal.

Shigaki has been heavily promoting TradeMining as the developer of the best and safest automated cryptocurrency trading app that can help people earn from 0.5 percent up to 2.73 percent a day. He was running the scam from a dedicated site, ‘TradeMining.io’, touting a proprietary crypto trading software called Infinity Trade Engine.

Additionally, Shigaki is accused of concealing his criminal past from potential clients. The probes brought to light financial obligations and criminal pleadings not shared with investors.

Over the past twelve years, he pleaded guilty twice to felony burglary in 2008 and 2009 and was sentenced to serve four months in prison. The Texas order further states that Shigaki was also sued for sabotaging a medicinal cannabis business by hacking into social media accounts. To resolve this case, Shigaki and his co-defendants were hit with a $3 million fine. Also, in 2015, Shigaki was sued by a former business partner and found liable for failing to meet his commitments to a company involved in the resale of gift cards.

Two years later, the serial criminal was charged in another fraud case and served a two-year probated sentence in December 2017.

Washington Regulators Were Involved in the Probes

The complaint alleges that Shigaki solicited customers to open discretionary bitcoin accounts and offered to trade those accounts through ‘Trade Engine’ – a fully automated software system that uses API and employs complex metrics to trade cryptocurrencies.

The long list of Shigaki’s bogus claims included that he works with a ‘partner’ who maintains the Trade Engine in the Netherlands and that their operations are done through a licensed investment advisor and fiduciary.

Furthermore, the board alleges Trade Engine was perpetuating a multilevel marketing scheme using agents in the United States to sell fraudulent investments to Texans. They hired multilevel marketers to promote its fraudulent investment opportunities by promising them lucrative commissions based on how well they recruit new investors.

The drop coincided with the announcement crypto derivatives venue BitMEX was formally being charged by U.S. regulators for unregistered trading, among other transgressions.

“The news of BitMEX being served with a lawsuit by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] was met with broad-based selling pressure,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto brokerage Bequant.

“This is big,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, on the CFTC’s announcement. However, Shah noted the declining influence of BitMEX on the market since March, when over $700 million in liquidations helped cause the price of bitcoin to dump as low as $3,854 on spot exchanges.

“BitMEX has slowly and consistently bled open interest since March,” Shah said. “This news may accelerate that narrative, but I do not see it being a systemic risk at this point if there is an orderly resolution.”

A number of new derivatives venues, most of which do not provide access to anyone in the United States, is one of the reasons for BitMEX’s decline in the market, said Bequant’s Vinokourov. “BitMEX’s overall importance to the broader ecosystem is not as critical as was the case a few years ago,” Vinokourov added. “Not only have many other exchanges been catching up with BitMEX liquidity and order book depth, but also a widely publicized tech issue earlier this year put a big dent into venue’s reputation amongst the larger crypto trading desks.”

Nonetheless, liquidations on BitMEX helped push bitcoin’s price down Thursday, as $15 million in sell liquidations in the past 24 hours wiped out long-oriented traders on the derivatives platform, similar to a margin call in traditional markets.

Outside of BitMEX, macro economic events could lead to selling pressure as October opens, according to Andrew Tu, an executive at crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier.

“Bitcoin has been stuck in the $10,000-$11,000 range since the drop in the beginning of September,” noted Tu. “The elephant in the room at this point is pretty much the macro climate, with [U.S.] elections coming up and the inability to compromise on a fiscal stimulus between the House [of Representatives] and Senate,” he added.

Ethereum miners reap record revenue from fees

Bequant’s Vinokourov was more bullish on the crypto market’s future, particularly with progress in Ethereum’s long and winding upgrade. “The underlying fundamentals are positive, especially for ETH given the very recent launch of ‘Spadina’ – the final testnet ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s upgraded mainnet release,” added Vinokourov.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Thursday trading around $353 and slipping 0.83% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

As increasing numbers of users adopt decentralized finance, or DeFI, on Ethereum, miners are reaping more revenue from the network than ever. Miner revenue from fees charged to use Ethereum averaged 38% in August, which was then a record high. It was surpassed in September, when miner revenue from fees hit another record, at 48.5%.

Tellurian Capital’s Jean-Marc Bonnefous, who has been investing in the crypto ecosystem since 2014, said some of the outrageous returns within DeFi are enticing users despite high transactional fees the miners are pocketing.

“Even with high gas costs on Ethereum, some of the net returns available on DeFi are still quite attractive compared to alternatives,” said Bonnefous. ”The basic problem, though, is that these returns are not sustainable in the long run, whatever the Ethereum costs and issues are.”

BitMEX Faces Grave Charges

BitMEX is a highly-popular crypto exchange that introduced perpetual swap contracts for Bitcoin which have now become the industry standard.

The exchange is a favorite among Bitcoin traders due to its ease of access. Prior to this year, the exchange required no KYC or AML verification. As of August, the exchange reported that they would implement mandatory KYC regulations.

The CFTC has charged BitMEX for violating multiple CFTC regulations, including operating an unregulated trading platform. CFTC Chairman noted in the press release:

“We can’t allow bad actors that break the law to gain an advantage over exchanges that are doing the right thing by complying with our rules.”

The owners of the exchange Arthur Hayes, Ben Dilo, Gregory Dwyer, and Samuel Reed are looking at the following repercussions:

“Disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution for the benefit of customers, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).”

Moreover, the Feds have simultaneously charged BitMEX with violating Bank Secrecy Laws which pertain to money-laundering and anti-terrorist activities. Preston Byrne, a lawyer at Anderson Kill Law, tweeted:

They may be wrong, and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said that bitcoin has “no value,” but the tone is strikingly different from the skepticism that many Wall Street analysts now express toward the lofty valuations in stock and bond markets.

Denis Vinokourov, Bequant: The market is testing the upper bounds of its recent range and, with the absence of fresh macro news flow that could dampen the risk on sentiment, bitcoin may just find enough momentum to break through the $11,000 price level and, more importantly, stay there. Open options interest continues to show signs of recovery.

Charlie Morris, ByteTree: The vast majority of bitcoin’s past gains coincided with periods of a flat or weak dollar. The implication is that bitcoin is likely to be a powerful hedge against U.S. dollar weakness. How likely is that? Quite likely given it is Fed policy.

IntoTheBlock: There are two areas of strong resistance for bitcoin based on on-chain data. The first one is the current resistance it is facing around the $11,000 mark, where 626K BTC has been bought by 1.17 million addresses. This creates resistance from many of these addresses looking to close their positions to break-even. After that, there is another similar resistance level between $11,400 and $11,700 as shown in the graph above. The good news is that past these resistance levels, there is likely to be less selling pressure past $12,000.

Matt Blom, Diginex: Despite the propensity to buy, hold and not move bitcoin, the network remains buoyed by growth. The only thing going sideways in bitcoin is the price.

Jason Lau, OKCoin: Bitcoin’s price momentum is still positive, with its pullbacks leaving higher highs. This is signaling a possible further continuation of this upwards move. Bitcoin perpetual swaps funding rates have started turning positive. This indicates that investors are more willing to go long at current price levels.

George McDonaugh, Keld van Schreven, Kr1 Plc: We are currently seeing some correlation [involving] bitcoin, other digital assets and movements in the equity and gold markets. We expect the trend of strengthening balance sheets and diversification into bitcoin to continue as the world’s monetary policies shift evermore towards unbridled money printing and higher inflation.

QCP Capital: The key support from the early month lows of $10,000 on BTC and $310 on ETH both saw substantial buying demand. This prevented any cascading short gamma selling into quarter-end, which had been our fear if those levels broke.

Constantin Kogan, BitBull Capital: We’re seeing a spike in activity by new participants coming into BTC not yet reflected in price. It doesn’t happen often. This is what traders call a divergence. In this case the trend looks more bullish.

Patrick Tan, Novum Alpha: While it may be tempting to subscribe to the notion that bitcoin will represent a safe haven in times of instability, there’s little evidence to support that view – especially since gold, tech stocks and bitcoin have all tracked each other closely this year. A further round of stimulus, or a smoother than expected political transition, could pave the way for bitcoin to move higher as politicians get past electing and get back to spending.

Bitcoin is trading in the narrow range of $10,600 to $11,000 for the seventh straight day.

The long-term sentiment remains bullish, as evidenced by a continued decline in the number of coins held on cryptocurrency exchanges – a sign of investors shifting to holding strategies.

In the short run, the cryptocurrency could continue to take cues from the U.S. dollar and stock markets.

“We can’t ignore the greenback’s breakout from its recent consolidation and expect a continued rally in the dollar to weigh over BTC,” said Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds.

The cryptocurrency fell by over 7% in September, confirming its biggest monthly decline since March as the oversold dollar index rose nearly 1.8%. Bitcoin, gold and S&P 500 have moved largely in the opposite direction to the dollar index since March.

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Tweet of the Day",2020-10-01 13:18:52+00:00,https://coingeek.com/how-to-scale-ethereum-today/,"This post originally appeared on Medium, and we republished with permission from its author, Xiaohui Liu.

Ethereum blockchain has been plagued by its notorious scalability issue, which is causing high fees and hindering its adoption. With Ethereum 2.0 still at least 18 months away, we propose a practical solution that works today. It is based on our previous approach to store large state inside Bitcoin efficiently.

Ethereum as a state transition system

From a technical standpoint, the ledger of a cryptocurrency such as Ethereum can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a “state” consisting of the status of all accounts and a “state transition function” that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result.

Store Ethereum global state inside Bitcoin

We can develop a Bitcoin stateful smart contract, in which the state is the global state of the Ethereum blockchain. Leveraging our novel Merkle tree technique, only the Merkle root of the state has to be stored in the contract, instead of the entire Ethereum state. And only Merkle paths of a sender and a receiver are needed in each transaction. As of this writing, Ethereum has ~82 million accounts, translating to a Merkle tree of depth 27. Each Ethereum transaction can be mapped to an equivalent state mutating transaction on Bitcoin, of size in the vicinity of 10KB. With the current miner fee rate (0.5 satoshi/byte) and exchange rate ($170), this translates to a fee of less than $0.01 per transaction, which is more than 100x cheaper than Ethereum mainnet currently. As Bitcoin continues to scale, the cost of such transactions will continue dropping.

Summary

We propose a pragmatic way to solve Ethereum’s well-known scalability issue, by storing its global state in a single contract on Bitcoin. In contract with the alternative proposal of ETH 2.0, it enjoys the following salient advantages:

It is validated by Bitcoin miners using Proof of Work and thus more secure than ETH 2.0’s Layer-2 approach. It is two or more orders of magnitudes cheaper. It is unboundedly scalable. It works today.

Based on these facts, we recommend Ethereum to consider migrating to Bitcoin as a strong scaling candidate.

Cryptocurrency exchange operator Diginex has announced the start of its listing and trading on Nasdaq.

Digital assets financial services company Diginex Limited announced on Thursday that it has completed a business transaction with 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company, which allows it to list and trade on Nasdaq. The company details:

Diginex Limited will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ‘EQOS’ where it will offer investors the opportunity to participate in the growth of digital assets.

The announcement adds that the company’s warrants will trade under the ticker symbol EQOSW.

“This is a watershed moment for both Diginex and the cryptocurrency industry with the listing of the first-ever company with a crypto exchange on Nasdaq,” Diginex CEO Richard Byworth commented. “This also presents the first opportunity for anyone trading in the US capital markets to buy directly into the equity of a digital asset ecosystem and opens the door for financial institutions to participate in the enormous opportunity that digital assets present.”

The Diginex group includes cryptocurrency exchange Equos.io, digital asset trading technology platform Diginex Access, digital asset custody provider Digivault, and the investment management business Bletchley Park Asset Management.

The Equos.io exchange claims to be “regulatory-focused” with features such as segregation of duties, portfolio margining, and cross-collateralization. The exchange was launched in July, ahead of the transaction with 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

According to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, prosecutors accused BitMEX of facilitating unregistered trading and other violations, including “conducting significant aspects of its business from the U.S. and accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers,” as reported by CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De.

The news dominated cryptocurrency news headlines and sent traders and analysts scrambling to assess the damage and implications. Some 23,000 bitcoin were apparently withdrawn from BitMEX addresses in a single hour, the cryptocurrency-markets data firm Glassnode tweeted early Friday, citing blockchain data.

BitMEX, led by CEO Arthur Hayes, said it intends to defend against the allegations “vigorously” adding that the trading platform was operating normally and that all funds were safe.

Cryptocurrency traders are conditioned to expect volatility whenever there’s major news involving one of the biggest industry exchanges, but despite the quick drop, prices quickly stabilized, as reported by CoinDesk’s Zack Voell.

BitMEX is a well-known player in the constellation of global cryptocurrency exchanges, partly because it was a pioneer, in 2016, of a new product called the “perpetual bitcoin leveraged swap.” At the time, few traders in nascent digital-asset markets could have anticipated what a major impact the obscure roll-out would have on the industry.

But the instrument, which made it easy for customers to trade the equivalent of $100 of bitcoin for every $1 down, proved hugely popular and successful among risk-hungry traders, vaulting BitMEX into the top ranks of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Even so, the perpetual swaps were infamous for exacerbating price swings: It’s a well-known trope among bitcoin traders that every time the market tilts one way or another, BitMEX customers’ thinly capitalized positions get liquidated in a series of rapid margin calls, exacerbating price swings that reverberated to other exchanges.

Such episodes are so notorious that crypto traders even have a slang verb for the phenomenon: to get “rekt,” with websites and even Twitter accounts devoted to tracking their magnitude and frequency.

If BitMEX’s role in the markets were to diminish, that might mean fewer volatility-inducing liquidations.

“Long term, it’s so much better for the spot market,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, an online cryptocurrency trading platform, told First Mover.

Industry executives were quick to point out that some traders had apparently been shifting their allegiances recently to rival exchanges that had copied BitMEX’s “100x” bitcoin derivatives contracts.

“Two years ago, this would have been catastrophic, because BitMEX was such a huge percentage of everybody who’s playing leveraged trading,” David Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes Inc., told CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen in a phone interview. “Now, there are quite a few alternatives to BitMEX and several of them have always been more stringent about trading or not allowing U.S. clients to trade on those platforms.”

BitMEX's market share of bitcoin futures open interest (blue ribbon in the middle) has been receding. Source: Skew.

CoinDesk’s William Foxley reported that the BitMEX news reverberated in the fast-growing blockchain-based sector of “decentralized finance,” or DeFi, where programmers are developing semi-automated platforms for lending and trading.

The systems are often cast as “uncensorable” since they mainly exist within strings of programming encoded atop the Ethereum blockchain network. The question is whether they still might be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions, since they are, ultimately the craft of “real, live humans.”

Centralized exchanges such as BitMEX as “opaque platforms that can easily facilitate money laundering,” Robert Leshner, founder of the DeFi lender Compound, told Foxley. “By contrast, DeFi done right is a breath of fresh air – complete transparency, accountability, tamper-resistance and self-custody.”

Ahem.

Cryptocurrency industry regulations are still evolving, and the rulemakers are always a few or myriad steps behind. But they do sometimes crack down, and it’s probably not a coincidence that often they take aim at the most threatening upstarts, those that attempt to change the rules of the game.

Bitcoin has come under pressure in the past 24 hours, seemingly due to the BitMEX controversy and risk-off moves in traditional markets.

On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal prosecutors announced they’re charging BitMEX for failing to implement anti-money-laundering procedures and operating an unregistered trading platform.

Further, President Trump announced early Friday he and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus and were going into self-quarantine, ratcheting up pre-election uncertainty and sending global equities lower.

Bitcoin has declined from $10,900 to $10,400 in the past 24 hours. The daily chart now shows the cryptocurrency is stuck in a narrowing price range.

A triangle breakdown would signal a continuation of the sell-off from August’s high above $12,400 and expose the 200-day average support at $9,400.

Alternatively, a breakout could invite stronger chart-driven buying pressure.

More than 32,000 bitcoin, currently worth about $335 million, has been withdrawn from BitMEX in less than 24 hours after the U.S. government filed charges against the crypto derivatives exchange’s owners.

More than 32,000 bitcoin, currently worth about $335 million, has been withdrawn from BitMEX in less than 24 hours after the U.S. government filed charges against the crypto derivatives exchange's owners.

The withdrawal figure was revealed by Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, on Friday at around 430 AM EST. Gradwell said BitMEX withdrawals are already adding about 25% more liquidity to the bitcoin market.

Some of the withdrawn bitcoins are going to Gemini and other known exchanges, while some to exchanges with personal wallets, said Gradwell, who thinks more withdrawals may follow in subsequent blocks.

Crypto data and analytics firm CoinMetrics said more than 37,000 bitcoin, currently worth about $387 million, has been withdrawn from BitMEX. The difference between the two figures — by Chainalysis and CoinMetrics — is common since different platforms have different data sources.







The large withdrawals come soon after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed charges against the owner-operators of BitMEX, including co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes, for allegedly operating an illegal exchange and violating rules. The DOJ also arrested BitMEX CTO Samuel Reed in Massachusetts.

BitMEX operator plans to fight the charges, a spokesperson for HDR Global Trading Limited, the exchange's parent company, told The Block yesterday. ""We strongly disagree with the U.S. government's heavy-handed decision to bring these charges, and intend to defend the allegations vigorously,"" said the spokesperson.

BitMEX currently still holds between 135,000 and 170,000 bitcoin, meaning many of its customers are still staying put — at least for now. The exchange's open interest (OI), or the value of outstanding derivative contracts that are yet to be settled, has also not declined that much yet, according to The Block Research.



The OI of BitMEX's bitcoin perpetual contracts has reduced by about 16% or $119 million, to stand at about $627 million at the time of writing. The OI of the exchange's Ehereum perpetual contracts, on the other hand, has declined by 37% or $60 million, to about $103 million.",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/trump-contracts-covid-bitmex-founders-indicted-a-chaotic-day-for-bitcoin/,"After a fairly uneventful news week, Friday has brought a few developments that are rather, shall we say, unexpected.

Beyond the crypto world, United States President Donald Trump announced on Twitter this morning that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19, a plot twist that has sent shudders down into the global economy.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

The news was originally broken by none other than the President himself, who tweeted “Tonight, @FLOTUS [Melania Trump] and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”

Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020

Within the cryptosphere, the New York Times reported on Thursday that American authorities brought criminal charges against the owners of one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency trading exchanges, BitMEX, accusing them of allowing the Hong Kong-based company to launder money and engage in other illegal transactions.

These four co-founders include BitMEX CEO, Arthur Hayes, and three co-owners: Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed and Gregory Dwyer. Samuel Reed. Hayes was arrested in Massachusetts on Thursday; the other three men are still ‘at large’.

In separate ways, both of these stories could have big implications for crypto markets, particularly, for Bitcoin.

Further Crypto Price Drops Could Be on the Horizon

While both the BitMEX indictment and Trump’s COVID case made it into the New York Times today, one of these just might be more significant than the other.

Indeed, while the BitMEX case is more specific to the crypto world, Trump’s COVID contraction seems to be having a more powerful effect on crypto markets. The BitMEX news caused a 3.7% fall in the price of BTC; prices rebounded slightly before Trump’s COVID Tweet sent them back down again.

Together, these two stories acted as a 1-2-punch that sank prices, which were down across the board at press time: BTC had dropped 3.4% in 24 hours, ETH was down 5.9%, XRP -3.61%, BCH -4.76%, and BNB -7.86%.

What is next? If traditional financial markets are any indication of what is coming for BTC and other cryptocurrencies (and, historically speaking, they have been), further price drops could be on the horizon.

Markets outside of the cryptosphere are reacting to Trump’s COVID announcement similarly to the way that they reacted to the widespread lockdowns in March: for example, gold is up, continuing the rebound that began ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate.

However, stock markets are another story.

The BBC reported that “stock market futures showed that all three of America’s main indexes – the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – are set to drop by at least 1.5% each when trading begins on Friday.”

Additionally, CoinDesk reported shortly after Trump announced his COVID case on Twitter, “the Australia ASX All Ordinaries is down 1.35%. In the U.S. markets, S&P 500 futures fell about 2%.”

”US Equities Plunge Following News That Trump Is COVID-Positive. Crypto Shitcoins Are Plunging Too.”

A number of analysts are predicting that BTC will go the way of the stock market, just as it did when the COVID financial crisis began in March of this year.

Nouriel Roubini, renowned American economist and chairman of Roubini Macro Associates LLC, wrote on Twitter that “the myth that crypto is a hedge in risk-off episodes totally failed when Bitcoin & other Shitcoins plunged 50% or more when equities plunged 35% in Feb-Mar.

“Same is happening now as US equities plunge following news that Trump is COVID-positive. Crypto Shitcoins are plunging too.”

”Pretty Bullish to Me.”

However, analysts who have been less critical of BTC and other cryptocurrencies in the past seem to believe that BTC will not be too drastically affected by today’s chaotic news cycle. After all, it has not been affected, at least, not yet.

“BitMEX charge and Trump contracting COVID-19 couldn’t take Bitcoin far below the $10k level even briefly,” wrote Joseph Young, crypto market analyst and Forbes contributor, on Twitter. “The resilience of Bitcoin during this cycle is quite impressive.”

Similarly, Marcel Burger, founder of crypto investment consultancy boutique Burger Crypto, wrote on Twitter that “Trump testing positive on COVID and the entire market tanks again. Bitcoin also dealing with bad news around Bitmex (founders arrested), but actually manages to control the damage. Pretty bullish to me.”

Renowned crypto market analyst, Willy Woo even believes that the BitMEX story could be a good thing for BTC in the medium to long-term.

“Oh, the irony,” he wrote. “The BitMEX news caused a pullback that’s WAY LESS than a proper liquidation event on BitMEX. It didn’t even break support. The BitMEX news is good for Bitcoin’s adoption also bullish for medium-term and long-term price.

“I was thinking the same thing,” wrote Twitter user @Grenouille212 in reply. “~3% correction for a major exchange going down? In the ‘old’ days… add a zero!”

The Election Cycle Will Continue to Have a Big Effect on Crypto Prices

It is true BTC’s <5% immediate reaction to either (or indeed, both) of these events could almost be considered a non-reaction in the history of an asset that is known for its volatility.

Still, the real reaction to these two events, and to their related affairs, could still be on the horizon.

For example, Trump’s COVID case will likely have a significant effect on the US Presidential election cycle, which in turn, could have a big effect on the price of Bitcoin.

Indeed, even before Trump tested positive for COVID, the American election cycles were having an increasingly powerful effect on cryptocurrency prices; and it is not all sunshine and roses.

eToro analyst, Josh Gilbert commented to Finance Magnates that “when looking at the technicals for Bitcoin, it’s appearing very bearish. It’s below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. However, as volatility in the markets increases over the next few weeks, it’s likely we will see the move of investors back towards Bitcoin as we did in August.

“In August, Bitcoin was trading about 12,000 and gold was also bullish above 2,000. VIX futures are also expected to increase throughout the end of October and the beginning of November, before dropping off at the start of December, clearly showing that the elections will cause significant market volatility.”

What Could a Trump Victory Mean for BTC?

In particular, markets seem to have been reacting to news that places one candidate in the lead over the other: JP Thieriot, CEO of Uphold told Finance Magnates that “to the extent that Bitcoin is a shorting of the status quo, you’d expect crypto to ‘moon’ if Trump wins.”

In other words, the civil and economic unrest that might follow a Trump re-election could be a further boon to Bitcoin, which has benefited heavily from this year’s coronavirus-related economic turmoil.

eToro’s analyst, Josh Gilbert also commented to Finance Magnates that “it appears that many investors on the stock market favour Trump, especially since he’s cut taxes over the years for the super-rich, which has been bullish for the stock market.

“Taking all of this into account, we are expecting to see uncertainty with the US elections. This is likely to see investors pile into safe-haven assets at times of uncertainty, with Bitcoin being one of those assets. Bitcoin has outperformed most assets so far this year, and a weakened dollar caused by the US elections is likely to be a strong driver.”

Could a Biden Victory Be a “Return to Normalcy”?

Uphold’s JP Thierot also said that “by contrast, Biden would represent a turn back towards normalcy, which might take the edge off the short. Then again, democrats tend to regulate more heavily, so there’s a big unknown.”

On the other hand, though, Shayne Coplan, chief executive and founder of Polymarket, told Finance Magnates that “many speculate that, given [Biden’s] proposed economic policies, Biden’s presidency could correlate with a further decrease in treasury yields.

“In that case, a Biden-Harris victory could trigger an influx of demand for alternative yield opportunities, and thus accelerate traditional finance’s adoption of DeFi,” Mr. Coplan said.

What Is Good for Bitcoin May Not Be Good for the World

Regardless of the outcome, though, what may be good for crypto may not necessarily be good for the world.

Alex Mashinsky, CEO of Celsius Network, told Finance Magnates that “a Trump presidency would mean more tax cuts and bigger deficits, while Biden will bring more healthcare and social spending and bigger deficits.

“Combine either with the Fed continuing to do whatever it takes to keep the safety net under the US economy and you can see how a mountain of debt, greater than all the debt anyone had in history, will come bearing down on the US dollar,” he continued.

“We may be able to hold back the debt for a while, but each passing day we deplete the trust the entire world has in the dollar and soon enough we will be left holding the bag with all these worthless dollars. While this may be good for Bitcoin and crypto, it is not good for democracy and for the world order as we know it.”",2020-10-02 10:31:27+00:00,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitmex-crypto-executives-charged-with-breaking-bank-secrecy-act-cftc-2020-10,"OZAN KOSE/Getty

Top executives of major cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX have been charged with violating US anti-money laundering rules, a statement issued by the federal regulatory agency showed on Thursday.

Co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed and head of business development Gregory Dwyer were each charged with one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act and one count of conspiracy to violate the act.

Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, the US Department of Justice said.

The act requires financial institutions in the US to maintain reports on currency transactions and customer relationships in order to prevent money laundering.

BitMEX ""failed to implement the most basic compliance procedures"" such as not having regulatory approval to run its trading facility, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in its own lawsuit.

William Sweeney, FBI assistant director, said the four defendants ""willfully violated"" the act by evading its requirements. ""One defendant went as far as to brag the company incorporated in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. because bribing regulators in that jurisdiction cost just 'a coconut.'""

BitMEX's platform received over $11 billion in Bitcoin deposits and earned over $1 billion in fees while accepting orders and funds from customers in the US, the CFTC said.

While Reed was arrested in Massachusetts on Thursday morning, the other three defendants remain at large, according to the Justice Department.

Legal counsel for Dwyer plan to contest the charges, saying that he ""always worked in good faith to comply with all applicable regulations."" Attorneys Sean Hecker and Jenna Dabbs said their client ""helped BitMEX establish an international business that operated with the highest integrity.""

BitMEX is the second-largest cryptocurrency derivates exchange based on trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap, after Binance. It holds around 193,000 BTC, worth about $2 billion at current prices.

The total crypto-market capitalization lost around $13 billion in the hours following news that BitMEX was charged with US regulation violations. Bitcoin fell by more than 4% to $10,455, while Ethereum fell more than 8%, and Ripple fell 5.7% on Friday.

The enforcement actions against BitMEX are ""a watershed moment in crypto enforcement,"" noted Kayvan Sadeghi, a partner at law firm Schiff Hardin. ""The Wild West era of ignoring financial regulations is over.""

Jon Barry Thompson, 49, admitted in Manhattan federal district court that his crypto companies – Volantis Market Making LCC and Volantis Escrow Platform LLC – never followed through with a promised $3.25 million bitcoin buy for one unnamed customer in the summer of 2018.

Thompson admitted to misrepresenting his companies' bitcoin custody, control, purchasing practices and risk exposure in order to secure the customer's funds.

He then wired the cash to a third party without first receiving the bitcoin, as he had promised the customer he would.

But the bitcoin never materialized and the customer's funds were never returned.

Thompson could face a maximum 10-year prison term. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 7, 2021.

Thompson also settled charges brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday. A newly filed consent order requires him to pay $7.4 million in restitution to two victims, permanently bars him from bitcoin trading, and compels him to cooperate with the CFTC in any future investigations.

Decentralized finance (defi) is allegedly coming to Venezuela after a recent decree from Venezuelan President, Nicolás Maduro and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. The government recently introduced a defi platform called BDVE that purportedly provides Venezuelan citizens with the means to swap ERC20 tokens in a noncustodial manner.

For quite some time now Venezuela has had to deal with strict economic sanctions. President Nicolás Maduro spoke about these sanctions in a new mandate called the “Anti-blockade Law for National Development and the Guarantee of Human Rights.”

On October 1, news.Bitcoin.com reported on how Maduro’s mandate described how cryptocurrencies would be leveraged in both domestic and global trade, in order to bypass the financial rules enforced by the U.S. government.

Shortly after Maduro’s mandate speech, the Venezuelan government released a new ‘defi exchange’ called BDVE. The exchange is ostensibly built using the Ethereum network and registered users will be able to purchase ERC20s and tokenized traditional assets as well.

The new exchange application is available now via the Google Play app store for Android devices. The BDVE.io web portal welcomes visitors to the “Decentralized Stock Exchange of Venezuela.” It also claims to be the “easiest place to buy and sell financial assets in Venezuela.”

A loosely translated description of BDVE says:

BDVE is an exchange connected to the decentralized system of encrypted markets. Its power lies in the ability to negotiate financial assets in a distributed way, saving intermediation and custody costs.

Now not just anyone can download the Venezuelan government’s defi app and think they can start swapping coins. The BDVE registration process involves the use of a SIDEME-related digital identification service, and you have to be a Venezuelan citizen. The BDVE defi exchange says there are zero commissions for buying and selling in fiat. Although there’s a 0.1% commission for alternative digital asset purchases.

In order to consider the BDVE application ‘decentralized’ the app promises “access from anywhere in the world, without restrictions.” Moreover, BDVE users can “keep custody of their assets,” allegedly in a noncustodial fashion.

It’s hard to say if BDVE is really noncustodial and operates in a permissionless manner, as it’s entirely state-controlled. However, the creators of the BDVE app and website do advertise the phrases “defi” and “decentralized” many times throughout the web portal’s pages. BDVE’s operations manual not only explains the SIDEME registration process, but it also notes users allegedly hold their own private keys.

Maduro’s “Anti-blockade Law for National Development and the Guarantee of Human Rights” mandate definitely highlights the use of various crypto assets, and the BDVE cushions the idea.

The state-run defi exchange was also discussed on social media and crypto-related forums after the BDVE app was launched. A few crypto enthusiasts thought the launch was a “big deal,” while others believe that a state-controlled defi exchange is a joke.

“This is a big deal – with a decentralized exchange there will be trust, and hence volume, for [the] trading of equities and digital tokens representing other assets,” one crypto proponent said on Twitter. “Could be a game-changer for a distressed economy like Venezuela,” he added.

Meanwhile, others made fun of the BDVE’s use of the word decentralized. “Venezuela launches [a] ‘decentralized’ exchange…. come on man,” another individual sarcastically tweeted about the state-run defi exchange launch. “The exchange, the petro and the mining, it’s all controlled by the government… it does NOT get more centralized than that.”

“The crypto custody market is poised to grow significantly following the OCC regulatory clarification,” said Ankur Kacker, senior vice president and specie specialist on Marsh’s DART team. “Our combined insurance storage solution can provide financial institutions seeking to enter the market a secure place to safeguard their clients’ assets and peace of mind knowing their exposures are covered.”

“Together, HUB and Marsh are empowering banks and other financial institutions to offer services for storing their clients’ digital assets by ensuring they are digitally secure and protected,” said Eyal Moshe, co-founder and CEO of HUB Security.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pwc-s-global-crypto-tax-report-reveals-the-need-for-further-regulatory-guidance,"One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, once said: “But in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” While this phrase was realized in 1789, the same still holds true today. The only difference is that taxes are slowly but surely catching up with crypto assets.

Therefore, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has just released its first annual Crypto Tax Index as part of the “Global Crypto Tax Report.” The detailed report contains the latest global crypto tax developments, along with crypto tax information for over 30 jurisdictions. Interestingly, 61% of jurisdictions surveyed have issued guidance on the calculation of crypto capital gains and losses for individuals and businesses.

The survey’s Crypto Tax Index ranks jurisdictions based on the comprehensive structure of their tax guidance. The report shows that the tiny yet innovative European country of Liechtenstein tops this year’s rankings, closely followed by Malta and Australia.

Crypto assets are finally taken seriously

Peter Brewin, a tax partner at PwC Hong Kong and a report contributor, told Cointelegraph that the industry is finally starting to see more activity by some of the supranational policy setters like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a result, tax authorities have been showing an increasing interest in crypto assets, but these guidelines are dated:

“What our research shows is that the guidance issued by many tax authorities is already getting dated. Yes, it is important that people know how to account for tax on the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but that is really crypto tax 101.”

Although basic guidelines have been established on how to tax common crypto assets, Brewin points out that loopholes remain. “What we really need, and which is lacking in nearly all jurisdictions, is principles-based guidance that is fit for the new decentralized economy,” he said.

That being said, one key takeaway from the report is that no jurisdiction has issued guidance yet on topics that are shaping the future of an economy built around digital assets. For instance, there are no taxation guidelines when it comes to crypto borrowing and lending, decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, tokenized assets and staking income.

This is alarming, considering the recent rise of DeFi and billions of dollars are being locked in DeFi contracts, as criminals may exploit the hype. While impressive, the PwC report highlights that without guidance, innovative companies and startups will be faced with significant tax uncertainty, especially in regards to cross-border activities.

The document provides some recommendations; for example, when it comes to the taxation of DeFi, it’s mentioned that this should include how income from the DeFi platform is taxed at the recipient level and whether jurisdictions may seek to tax payments at the source. This is similar to how withholding taxes are commonly applied to interest payments in traditional finance.

The report also takes into account the crypto industry’s ever-changing ecosystem, therefore, noting that future guidance should be principles-based and not overly prescriptive.

Crypto still primarily viewed as property

Another important finding in the report is that most jurisdictions view cryptocurrencies as a form of property from a tax perspective. In fact, very few consider digital assets as currency for taxation purposes. The report notes that this is because the disposal of property is considered similar to a barter transaction; therefore, results in a gain or loss could be subject to tax.

Yet this isn’t the case in all jurisdictions. For instance, countries such as Israel are starting to propose that Bitcoin should be taxed as a currency. If this proposal becomes a law, digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) could be taxed at a lower rate in Israel than those currently in place.

Although, having cryptocurrencies taxed as a currency could also result in challenges. The report points out that a tax change could potentially be triggered each time an individual spends a digital asset. This is problematic because many consumers are not able to calculate their gains or losses from each of their daily transactions. This is generally not the case with fiat but could be if cryptocurrencies were to be used, resulting in another barrier to mass adoption.

Tax uncertainty will create challenges

Overall, PwC’s crypto tax report shows that while significant work has been done to provide guidance for the taxation of digital assets, the industry is not up-to-date with recent developments. In turn, businesses will continue to be faced with tax uncertainty, creating further challenges for adoption and innovation.

While this may be, authorities are aware of the fact that new crypto taxation guidelines are needed. Mazhar Wani, fintech leader at PwC U.S., told Cointelegraph that while it’s tough to estimate when official guidance will be issued in regards to topics like DeFi and staking, these points are being discussed by global tax authorities. “The OECD is also looking at many of these points since it falls within their broader initiatives, so we hope to see something soon,” he said. However, Brewin points out that when it comes to DeFi, taxation clarity could take much longer:

“Particularly when you have a fully decentralized platform, it’s not clear to me that approach will work, given that you are dealing with a completely different animal. We’ve not really seen a parallel for this when it comes to tax.”

Although this may be, Brewin suggests that today’s challenges can be overcome if the industry continues to work with policymakers to ensure that they understand the complexity and ever-changing nature of the crypto industry.",,https://www.coindesk.com/venezuela-rolls-out-ethereum-based-stock-exchange-to-help-skirt-us-sanctions,"Disclosure

Crypto is one of the most innovative and groundbreaking technological developments to have occurred in recent history. The question is: is crypto still innovative, and are new cryptoasset platforms being increasingly expected to provide significant technical improvements over their predecessors?

According to experts speaking to Cryptonews.com, some people are always on the lookout for the next ‘big thing’ in crypto, with many of these people motivated more by financial speculation than any specific desire for technological evolution.

However, an arguably bigger group of people within crypto appreciate the relative stability of platforms such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). By updating themselves in a more gradual and secure manner, such platforms provide the solid foundation on which innovations can grow.

Cryptoassets: the new smartphones?

Some people view cryptoassets as a new kind of consumer tech product, one that has to be constantly updated, upgraded and superseded. This kind of thinking is typified by a tweet this April from Huobi:

Innovation inspires, let’s show it! — Huobi (@HuobiGlobal)

Looking at Twitter, or searching the web for the “most innovative cryptocurrencies,” you’ll find no shortage of people championing any given new cryptoasset as the greatest token ever developed. You’ll also find something very similar for new platforms and services built on top of various blockchains, particularly those related to decentralized finance (DeFi).

Our team is always happy to support innovative DeFI projects. From now on @UniswapProtocol’s $UNI # will be availab… https://t.co/a5lLEYtIBe — Changelly (@Changelly_team)

However, while there does seem to be a noticeable tendency in crypto for some people to talk in terms of which project is more ‘innovative’ than the other, industry figures don’t believe it’s a dominant tendency. What’s more, CoinRecoil, an India-based crypto exchange, Founder Kunal Barchha told Cryptonews.com that a desire for ‘innovation’ is often simply driven by a desire for a new coin to pump.

“I would say a very few percentage of people view cryptos as consumer tech products. Most of the people are interested in riding the wave and making profits,” he said.

Barchha acknowledged that those most dedicated to and personally invested in a project may be focused more on its technological aspects than anything else.

However, he argued that many people “are mostly waiting for the ‘next big thing’ to make decent profits. We have seen that during the [initial coin offering] boom, then [initial exchange offerings], and now DeFi.”

Tim Rainey, Chief Financial Officer at New York-based mining co-location provider Greenidge Generation, also suggested that the crypto community is generally split between two basic mindsets:

One sees cryptoassets as a speculative hedge against the current financial system,

The other wants to get in on the next big thing at the ground floor.

“The former value things like stability, network effects and branding, and generally gravitate towards BTC due to these qualities. They view its stability as a feature not a bug as evidenced by Michael Saylor’s explanation for putting MicroStrategy’s reserve cash in BTC,” he said.

As for the latter group, it’s “motivated by the possibility of being among the first to invest [in a new crypto] before it can potentially reach the popularity and price appreciation equal to those of Bitcoin or other well-known cryptocurrencies.”

Technological foundations and standards need stability

Central to this split are two key factors which make stability a good rather than bad thing in crypto.

Firstly, in the case of Bitcoin, its growing status as a store of value arguably means that it doesn’t really need to constantly innovate.

“Bitcoin is a world-class brand like Coca-Cola or Disney now. It's known and trusted,” said Guardian Circle, a community emergency response network that uses the GUARD token, Founder Mark Jeffrey, who argued that Bitcoin’s cautious approach to change is one of its strengths.

“Yes, it's slow. But as a store of value, it's more than good enough,” he told Cryptonews.com. “Bitcoin's purpose in life is to replace gold. It doesn't NEED any more features. And for brand and trust purposes: older is better. I don't think anything can or will supplant Bitcoin now as the primary digital store of value. That race is done.”

Secondly, many blockchains essentially serve as infrastructure for the varied third-party projects built on top of them. According to Bitcoin SV (BSV) developer Brendan Lee, this means it would be unwise to frequently update and change them.

“The whole idea is to create a system that can be used as a foundation layer for future technology. This means that it must be simple enough to build anything, but also that it must have a locked protocol,” he said.

Lee argued that few people would accept a system for storing value that might get an 'upgrade' which renders their money unspendable or their financial application unusable. “It is not the protocol that must change to add new use cases, but the protocol which must be flexible enough to accomodate all use cases.”

Future innovation

Still, for cryptoassets that don’t aim at becoming infrastructure or a store of value, some degree of regular innovation is necessary.

“Blockchains whose main aim is not to be a store of value would be expected by their users to continue evolving to better meet their original vision. If such a blockchain stops innovating, other blockchains that aim to solve the same problems may take its place,” said Igor Runets, Founder and CEO of BitRiver, a Russia-based mining services provider.

In light of this, we can continue to expect a regular flux of new projects, particularly when it comes to projects built on top of blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. But as the above has shown, there’s no innovation without some degree of underlying stability.

Jon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a cryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market Making LCC.

The 49-year-old Thompson was arrested in July 2019 at his West Burke Street home on College Hill and charged with two counts each of commodities fraud and wire fraud. He has been free on $500,000 bond in the case.

On Thursday, Thompson pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud in federal court in Manhattan, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release.

Thompson is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 7; the charge carries a possible maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Prosecutors previously said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-peer digital currency Bitcoin -- $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second.

Thompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no risk of default, prosecutors allege.

In June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send his company Volantis more than $3 million for a Bitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and that money could not be lost.

Thompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, prosecutors said.

Thompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company’s money but in reality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first receiving any of the Bitcoin in hand.

In July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for Bitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party without first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege.

Thompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney previously said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized companies didn’t understand, and he “allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency.”

Forbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading cryptocurrencies, gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf.

Symphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned.

In that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, reportedly reached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the first settlement payment, Forbes reported.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed separate civil charges against Thompson.

Over the next four years, the European Union will introduce new rules that will allow the introduction of blockchain technologies and crypto assets into the traditional financial sector.

For now, however, the need to obtain regulatory approval for financial activities remains the main obstacle to entering the market, which is also associated with a large waste of time and money for startups — although this is not always the case. Additionally, each business model requires a specific type of license.

Crypto regulators and types of authorization

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, regulates banks, crypto and fintech projects. There are five types of authorization for financial activities in the country — licensing, recognition, authorization, approval and registration. Commonly, though, only two of these are being used by fintechs — recognition and authorization.

Types of authorization include: permitted activities; client onboarding options; the jurisdictions in which you can attract users; documents accepted for user identification; ways of storing customer information; most of the Anti-Money Laundering procedures; transaction limits; capital requirements; regularity and methodology of audits, among others.

When you choose and apply for the right type of authorization for your business, keep in mind that this will determine your business opportunities and degree of responsibility for many years ahead. At the beginning of the journey, it all might seem so overwhelming and hard to understand that you will feel like leaving everything up to your lawyers.

In practice, however, delving into this and starting to closely interact with specialists will help you create the most effective legal model and forge the best strategy for its development without requiring huge initial legal cost investments while speeding up the launch of the product on the market.

Step one: Sandbox

You can start a crypto service in the so-called FINMA sandbox. Depending on the project’s infrastructure, the startup can entirely develop a product, accept customer money, sell financial services, issue bank cards, and can carry out many other activities even before obtaining authorization.

Fintechs that meet the following requirements qualify to get into the sandbox:

The total amount of assets received from clients does not exceed 1 million Swiss francs, or $1.1 million.

The received funds are not invested, and interest is not paid (in this case, you can use your own company assets, earn on them and, if your model provides this, pay interest to clients).

Depositors must be informed in advance that FINMA does not supervise fintechs, and the safety of funds deposited is not guaranteed by the insurance (this rule applies to all types of authorization, except for banking activities, where supervision by FINMA and deposit insurance is mandatory).

If a startup meets these requirements, the company can temporarily do without authorization from the regulator. It is imperative to prepare a legal memorandum about this, which professional lawyers will help with.

However, when the company outgrows the sandbox restrictions, the issue of obtaining authorization from FINMA will become the cornerstone for further development of the fintech and is one of the decisive factors for accelerating the commercial launch of the product.

Step two: Self-regulatory organizations

Most startups do not have the millions of Swiss francs required to obtain a full banking license from FINMA, including meeting the minimum capital requirement. In this case, you can join one of the 11 self-regulatory organizations, or SROs, operating in Switzerland and receive the status of a financial intermediary.

A financial intermediary requires regulatory approval for each individual type of activity instead of all of them at once, as would be the case with a bank. Only the services as part of the declared product structure that have passed the authorization can be performed. If the product structure changes, you need to get approval from FINMA or the relevant SRO again.

SRO members can conduct more than 10 types of activities. These include asset management, foreign exchange transactions, money transfers, along with insurance and new payment methods, including cryptocurrency operations and others. Companies can provide services to clients located in Switzerland and abroad, and to both enterprises and individuals.

To join an SRO costs several thousands of Swiss francs, which includes a number of annual payments, audit fees, etc. For example, in our case, with 60,000 users, the total cost of an SRO is about 100,000 Swiss francs, or approximately $110,000, per year. This is still much less than a banking license would cost.

If you decide to join an SRO, be prepared to pay large legal support costs, which can range from 150,000 to 400,000 Swiss francs, or $165,000 to $435,000. This will pay your lawyers to correctly describe the model of your product and compile dozens of mandatory applications and forms, proving to the SRO that this form of regulation is suitable for your crypto service.

It takes three months from the date of application to join an SRO. If you need to speed up the process, you can use the fast-track processing option that takes just two weeks for 1,500 Swiss francs, or $1,600.

Using “exceptions”

Another aid in reducing the regulatory burden may be the “exceptions” that may apply depending on the model of the fintech product.

Exception # 1: A company is not considered to be banking if it meets the requirements that apply to participants in the regulatory sandbox (in accordance with the new edition of “Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks (Bank Ordinance, BO)” article 6, paragraph 2, letter (a)).

Exception # 2: A license for savings is not required for assets that arise in payment systems and neobanks and are recognized as “non-deposits” if the following conditions are met:

Peer-to-peer operations are prohibited — i.e., transfers from card to card. The maximum balance per client does not exceed 3,000 Swiss francs ($3,299). No interest is paid on funds.

The exception applies in accordance with article 5, paragraph 3, letter (e) of the “Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Ordinance, BO)” and subject to clarification No. 18 FINMA-Circular 2008/3.

Exception # 3: Settlement accounts, which are opened for some non-bank companies participating in SROs (dealers, asset managers and other financial intermediaries) are also not deposits if:

Companies hold a deposit to execute a client’s transaction. No interest is credited to the account. The duration of the transaction is limited.

The exception applies in accordance with article 3, paragraph 3, letter (c) of the “Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Ordinance, BO).”

A wide variety of fintechs can take advantage of the regulatory sandbox, get a membership in self-regulatory organizations, and participate in legal exemptions. However, there are also a few points that concern only crypto services.

Choose the right architecture

Since crypto projects occupy a special place between the world of traditional finance and the world of digital assets, there are additional requirements for crypto companies in many countries, and Switzerland is no exception.

When registering our crypto service with the self-regulatory organization VFQ, we thoroughly studied the regulations that govern the Swiss Federal Council and FINMA. If we sum up all the important points from the “Legal framework for distributed ledger technology and blockchain in Switzerland” and the “FINMA-Fact Sheet / Virtual Currencies” documents and requirements, crypto services can accept fiat money without obtaining a banking license when the following conditions are met:

Settlements for the purchase or sale of cryptocurrency and temporarily arising obligations to fulfill them fall under one of the exceptions given above. The fact of ownership of cryptocurrency by each client is reflected in the blockchain directly and separately from the company’s funds. Each cryptocurrency deposit can be attributed to a specific client at any given time.

All this should be taken into account by crypto startups during the product development stage. Moreover, the correct design of the cryptocurrency storage architecture is another reason that will help to avoid the need to obtain a banking license while remaining legal.

According to the Swiss regulator’s general approach, a deposit is defined as a service in which a client transfers funds and/or digital assets to an organization and can then dispose of them only by interacting with its representatives. If the functionality of the service allows you to remove intermediaries from the decision-making chain for the disposal of the client’s funds, this option is not considered a deposit.

In practice, this means that the storage should be designed so that the user, at all times, owns the private key, and the crypto service receives this key only “on lease.” Simply put, it is necessary to exclude the e-wallet provider from the process of managing the client’s funds. However, such a solution can only be used for cryptocurrency due to its technological features. For fiat deposits and accounts which we do not yet have, it will not work.

The flexible approach of the Swiss regulator to licensing fintechs once again proves that the path of startups is not at all about copying what has already been done before. For each business model, you need to look for your own optimal authorization method that will allow you to bring the product to market faster and at lower costs. Legal companies will certainly help with this, but the result will largely depend on how well the founder understands the issue.

What Is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is the use of a public record in an electronic or virtual format. This type of currency isn’t regulated by any government and isn’t backed by anything tangible. As a result, many governments have been hesitant to endorse it. The currency has been around since 2020 and has rapidly gained in popularity worldwide due to its low transaction cost and liquidity.

A cryptocurrency is basically a virtual asset designed to function as a virtual medium of trade wherein virtual coin ownership records are maintained in a ledger located in a computerized database with strong encryption key protection to ensure its privacy. One of the advantages of cryptocurrency is that it has the ability to function across national boundaries.

A cryptocurrency is created by a public record, which is a public database in an online database. The asset can be stored in an individual’s PC or on a server through an Internet connection. The software that runs the software allows for users to make transactions of the cryptocurrency. These transactions occur between the user and a third party or an online exchange. The only way for the information to be stored securely is by using encryption, an encryption key, or multiple security levels. A third party is an entity that trades with the cryptocurrency and makes payments of the coin to the owner.

On the other hand, if you consider investing in cryptocurrency anytime soon, below are the tips to remember from the get-go:

Identify The Source Of Fund – First of all, you need to determine the source of fund for your investment. You need to choose which cryptocurrency you’ll use in order to determine the basis of your trading.

What Is Blockchain Technology

If you think about the past few years, you’ll realize that a lot of new businesses are going to be focusing on developing the most reliable technology available. This technology is known as the Blockchain technology. This technology is creating applications in a variety of non-traditional financial and commercial services. The potential applications of this revolutionary technology have been endless.

The ability to track financial transactions is accomplished by storing the public and private keys. There are many ways to implement the Blockchain technology into your investment efforts. One example of this application is the ability to provide an audit trail for all financial transactions that a user is making. This will enable investors to see exactly where the money is going. In addition to this, the Blockchain also helps a user to increase its overall security, which, in turn, increases the security of the data and assets.

To better understand how it works and the uses of Blockchain technology, it will be necessary for you to get familiar with the basics of this technology. The basic premise behind the use of the Blockchain is to create a database where all of the information regarding financial transactions can be stored. A public and private key pair is, then, placed at the bottom of the database.

The public key is the actual physical key that can be accessed by any user, while the private key is the encryption key only the owner can access. This technology has been used for some time in other sectors, but it’s only recently that the general public has become interested in this technology when using digital currencies for investment purposes.

Conclusion

With the information mentioned above, people are starting to recognize the value of both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, and this means that there’s plenty of money that can be made. However, it does also mean that the value of these things isn’t going to grow overnight. It’s going to take some time for people to gain a better understanding of these technologies and how they work.

And, once people are able to understand the value of these two different kinds of technology, they’re going to become more interested in taking advantage of them, as well as have a very positive impact on the way that the financial markets operate.",2020-10-03 16:07:32+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-coinbase-hands-over-customer-data-to-uk-tax-authority/,"Crypto Exchange Coinbase Hands Over Customer Data to UK Tax Authority

Coinbase is handing over customer data to the British tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The measure affects customers with a U.K. address who received more than £5,000 ($6,450) worth of cryptocurrency during the 2019/20 tax year.

On Oct. 2, Coinbase sent an email to its U.K. users advising them that it will share their account information with the HMRC. The exchange said the tax agency originally asked for records relating to all UK customers dating back to 2017, but it later worked out a plan that resulted in “a revised notice with reduced scope”.

The revised plan requires the disclosure of user data with a British address who received over $6,450 into their Coinbase account during the 2019/20 tax period, either by way of purchases or deposit of digital assets.

Coinbase says the HMRC request will affect under 3% of its U.K. customers, reports The Block. A spokesperson for the exchange explained:

These requests are commonplace for financial services companies. Through a series of constructive conversations with HMRC, we agreed upon on a more limited and focused disclosure…

A spokesperson for the HMRC noted that the authority regularly gathers information from various sources in order to “improve the integrity of the tax system and to identify those that have failed to declare their gains.”

Requests for customer information were also reportedly sent to crypto platforms such as Etoro and Cex.io, says the report.

In New Zealand, the country’s tax agency, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), is requesting that crypto companies turn over their customers’ personal details, cryptocurrency asset values as well as the type of asset held.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also been sending warning letters to crypto investors seeking clarity about whether they had reported their transactions correctly.

Although this might not be true given the relatively high Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction fees and relatively slow transfer speeds, Lo claims that digital assets may offer alternative payment options. But he points out that when customers want to sell their cryptocurrency and withdraw cash (fiat money) from their accounts, the banking system can make the process take several business or working days.

To address these issues, Coinbase is now offering instant withdrawals in around 40 different countries including the US, UK, and several other European jurisdictions. Customers based in the US, UK, and Europe now have the option to withdraw their funds by using a linked Visa debit card. Customers in the US may withdraw funds with their Mastercard.

(Note: for more details on how to make withdrawals, check here.)

Terry Angelos, SVP and global head of Fintech, Visa, stated:

“By enabling real-time card withdrawals through the Visa Direct capability, Coinbase is delivering a faster, simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier to convert crypto balances into fiat, which can be spent at the more than 60M merchant locations where Visa is accepted.”

Sherri Haymond, EVP, Digital Partnerships at Mastercard, noted that today’s consumers are more “digitally driven” because they’re eager to use real-time payment methods that serve their individual needs or requirements.

Haymond added that by using Mastercard Send, it’s possible to seamlessly convert cryptocurrency into fiat. This option should give Coinbase customers the option to “securely and seamlessly withdraw and use their funds wherever Mastercard debit is accepted — giving them greater flexibility and convenience to manage their financial lives.”

Coinbase continues to list new tokens so that its users have more trading options. The exchange recently listed Balancer (BAL) and Ren (REN) tokens for Coinbase Pro users.",2020-10-16 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/43803/sec-chairman-open-to-crypto-based-exchange-traded-fund,"In brief SEC Chair Jay Clayton is open to a tokenized ETF.

This would be a tokenized stock that represents an index.

But recent clampdowns on crypto companies suggests that current offerings don't cut it.

Though the US Securities and Exchange Commission has struggled to keep up with the pace of innovation in the decentralized finance space, its chairman, Jay Clayton, is open to its potential.

In a webinar with the Chamber of Digital Commerce yesterday, Clayton said, “It may very well be the case that [...stocks] all become tokenized.” Tokenized stocks form one of a slew of financial products that fall under the DeFi umbrella; others include non-custodial loans and decentralized stablecoins.

Clayton’s even open to a tokenized exchange-traded fund, or ETF—essentially, a stock whose price tracks an index. “We're willing to try that; our door is wide open. If you want to show how to tokenize the ETF product in a way that adds efficiency, we want to meet with you, we want to facilitate that,” he said.

Recent SEC actions suggest that this day has not yet come.

In July, the SEC, along with another US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, took Abra, a company offering tokenized stocks to the cleaners. The SEC alleged that its tokenized stocks constituted “security-based swaps subject to US securities laws.” The California-based startup had to pay a $300,000 fine and stop offering such products.

And the SEC has rejected several attempts for Bitcoin ETFs—regular (non-tokenized) ETFs that track the price of Bitcoin—on the grounds that Bitcoin's price is prone to manipulation.

Without referencing Abra or the proposals for Bitcoin ETFs, Clayton said, ”we got off on the wrong foot in this innovation. There was the theory that because it was so efficient, because it could have had so much promise, we could toss aside some of those principles of responsibility and transparency.”

The SEC Chairman added, “you have to stay true to the principles, which is people who are distributing stock. People who are insiders of the companies for which the stock has been issued—they have responsibilities.”

His main advice: Don’t try and pull the wool over his eyes. The SEC has chased after many cryptocurrency companies that ran ICOs, claiming that they were exempt from securities regulations because they were setting up payment systems, not offering speculative investments.

“What we don't like is when someone says, ‘you know, the function is payments,’” he said. “Don't pretend that it's a payment system when it's actually a financing vehicle.”",2020-10-03 13:59:08,https://www.coindesk.com/lana-swartz-new-money-book-crypto-communities,"A bunch of my friends from high school back in Kansas were getting together for a birthday at a hometown bar a little while back and I, now a New Yorker, couldn’t be there. So I told one of my buddies to buy everyone a round and Venmo me for whatever it cost.

His response: “What’s Venmo?”

It was one of about a billion times life has told me that you can’t go home again, but this story would come as no surprise to Lana Swartz, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia. She’s the author of the book “New Money: How Payment Became Social Media,” which goes into detail explaining how payment apps are more than tools.

In short: Payment signals affiliation. Swartz calls payment groupings “transactional communities,” and every credit card or national currency represents one. As Swartz writes in her book, “Venmo is not a wallet, it’s a conversation.”

I’ve joined it. My old friends are still splitting the tab by hand. So it goes.

What about crypto?

“New Money” is a read that will force members of any crypto tribe to ask themselves: Who am I? What does using ETH or BTC or XLM or ATOM say about me and those with whom I affiliate?

Swartz’s book is all about the complex story of how payments work, and what your chosen currency says about you.

Acknowledging this, Swartz describes blockchain in a particularly grand way, writing:

""A money that remembers better is, for many people, the 'dream' promised by blockchain, a perfect transactional memory, a truly distributed ledger of all money's distributed agency, eternal and transcendent of human incapacity, remembering everything and beholden to no one.""

As Swartz put it when we spoke, there was a camp of early Bitcoiners, those who counted themselves among the cypherpunks or an adjacent group, who knew that “getting the money right will either be a matter of having the internet be just another overlay on the existing kind of tyranny, existing power, or it could really be an opportunity for changing society for the better.”

But, since Bitcoin, more than a thousand cryptocurrencies have sprung up, and 25 of those (as of this writing) have market capitalizations greater than $1 billion. Nothing gets to that kind of value without some number of people buying into its message.

But blockchain tribes tell garbled stories about themselves; each credit card company knows exactly how it wants its customers to see themselves.

Peasants into Frenchmen

It should be noted that “New Money” is about payment, not crypto, but it gives crypto a respectful spot in the overall story, which is a useful one for this industry.

Adopting a given kind of money has long helped instill a shared identity. In our conversation, Swartz and I revisited her book’s discussion of Eugen Weber, the UCLA historian who wrote in 1976 of how the French franc was a key tool in turning “peasants into Frenchmen” because using it gave them a transactional community, one where the fruits of their labor could be redeemed far from home.

Since nations demonstrated the efficacy of creating transactional communities to bind their people, the private sector has just gone on building more and more transactional communities on top of fiat. Swartz describes how traveler’s checks were a way for wealthy people to show that their money was good all over the world. Charge cards were a way for businessmen to show they were elite.

And bitcoin came along and showed that some people bought into this complicated idea of self-sovereignty, the idea that two people should be able to exchange value without anything bigger (be it a state or a giant company) standing between them. But how well are the converted telling their conversion story?

But hold on: I suspect some readers think I am, on Swartz’s behalf, overselling this notion that payment method has meaning. If so, consider one compelling data point: this 2015 post she cites on the website Budgets Are Sexy, unpacking what a date’s method of payment indicates about him.

It will be a brand new thing for single guys to be neurotic about. You’re welcome.

What are we talking about?

So who are the people transacting in crypto?

I tried and failed to get Swartz to make broad generalizations about crypto communities because she’s been watching them since at least 2013. She demurred, no clue why.

That said, she was willing to say how strange it is that so much energy is going into payments, a sector that has typically been viewed as quite dull.

“If you had told anybody 10 or 20 years ago that there would be a subculture of young, kind of cool people trying to come together to build an alternative financial system,” she said, “that’s kind of historically unprecedented.”

But what crypto natives might not have really wrapped their heads around just yet, and they need to in order to advance, is that using these things isn’t just about disrupting rent-seekers or establishing self-sovereignty, it also means choosing between either inducting people into a transactional community or accepting that these cultures will get diluted if they manage to grow.

I am not especially convinced crypto’s evangelists are thinking about either. “Ethereum developers in Berlin look really different than venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, but they both look really different than people at home just trying to buy the latest asset,” Swartz said. She’s not so sure anyone’s accounting for those differences.

Meanwhile, the mainstream payment rails aren’t just winning out over crypto, they are winning out over nation-states, too.

As Swartz put it, payment rails are already eroding the state. “In practical and really mundane ways I think of myself traveling as a citizen of American Express as much as I do the United States.”

Isn’t this just the fight Bitcoin was supposed to win?

Swartz took this a step further: Travelers in another era might have called their consulate when they found themselves in trouble abroad; she feels sure her first call would be to her credit card company and most likely many others like her would say the same.

Plastic diplomacy

This all feels much like the sort of vending-machine citizenship that Davidson and Rees-Mogg predicted in 1999’s “The Sovereign Individual” (part of crypto’s lingua franca), but Swartz doesn’t think it will actually play out quite so neatly or quite so pleasantly, with everyone just freely picking and choosing their citizenry.

“I can easily imagine, in the withering of the state – not these really exciting networks of alterity – just corporate-states replacing nation-states,” she said. In other words: everything we dislike about government and big companies, together at last.

But if Venmo succeeded by becoming a conversation, can crypto do the same?

Writes Swartz:

""State-issued currency created a 'common economic language' for citizens of the nation-state, social media money offers a private, cohesively branded experience of economic communication.""

So if using crypto is also a conversation, then what are we talking about when we transact in it? And who else would want to join in such a discussion if they knew it was taking place?

Consider this: For my buddies in Kansas, the Venmo conversation was not one that interested them – even if it meant free beers.

Right now, PayPal, Mastercard and their allies in Washington and Frankfurt are winning the game of expanding their transactional communities. They have a larger conversation going, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for other ways to operate in parallel.",2020-10-03 12:00:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-need-for-a-dialogue-between-crypto-businesses-and-regulators,"This year has been a strong one for digital asset markets, highlighted by growing institutional inflows and a propitious shift in the regulatory environment. Witness the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s September letter that says crypto exchanges that comply with SEC Rule 15c3-3 (the Customer Protection Rule) are free to trade digital asset securities.

With more than 50 million people around the world investing and trading in crypto in meaningful volumes, Goldman Sachs has recently appointed a new global head of digital assets, as did JPMorgan in February. Goldman’s move was a noted reversal following a May earnings call in which one of its analysts questioned the legitimacy of Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset class.

The timbre of digital asset markets is changing from primarily speculative in nature, driven by high-frequency individual traders riding waves of volatility, to longer-term buy-and-hold activity. For instance, Yale and Harvard have both made waves in recent months with SEC filings revealing multi-million-dollar investments in crypto funds as the asset class continues to gain momentum.

Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have made recent announcements that they, too, are embracing the digital asset markets, with Visa recently writing on its blog:

“Digital currencies have the potential to extend the value of digital payments to a greater number of people and places.”

Indeed, a growing number of organizations and governments around the globe are embracing digital assets for trading, investing and non-intermediated payments. As proof of this momentum, the World Economic Forum established a consortium to govern digital currencies this year, including government-issued stablecoins, which central bankers have increasingly embraced.

As of mid-July 2020, according to the Bank for International Settlements report, at least 36 central banks have published retail or wholesale central bank digital currency work. At least nine countries have undertaken CBDC pilots; 18 central banks have published research on retail CBDCs; and another 13 have announced research or development work on a wholesale central bank digital currency.

Regulatory clarity has been slow to materialize as a major impediment to adoption by traditional investors and service providers, however, change is undeniably underway.

In addition to the recent SEC move, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently announced that national banks can provide crypto services, including holding private keys for customers and other custody solutions. And crypto businesses enthuse at the prospect of a harmonized patchwork of state and federal money transmitter rules. Such developments are making markets more palatable for participants entering this space.

According to a new report by Fidelity Digital Assets head of research Ria Bhutoria:

“The OCC’s July 2020 interpretive letter represents a major step forward in increasing the comfort of traditional institutions with digital assets. To the extent that institutions regulated by the OCC actually provide digital asset custody services, a greater number of investors and users may also be more comfortable trading, holding and engaging with digital assets via intermediaries held to the strict regulatory standards of a federal agency in charge of administering the banking system in the United States.”

That being said, it’s a chicken-and-egg quandary: Progress with the regulatory and infrastructure development required to support digital asset markets has not kept pace with activity in these markets.

Does regulatory uncertainty remain?

As rules and regulations continue to be introduced and refined, a host of questions remain:

Will banks store customers’ digital asset keys and facilitate transacting on crypto platforms, and, if so, how; or will they require customers to engage another provider to de-risk that function? Particularly given the increase in crypto block trading, what prime service offerings can reduce or eliminate the potential for broken trades and theft of assets? How can crypto businesses manage the fragmentation of instrument pricing and reporting? How can crypto businesses navigate the rapidly changing and complex regulatory landscape?

The extent to which banks will custody private keys and act as fiduciaries or lay off the risks to other qualified providers is unclear. A growing number of crypto prime service providers have emerged to provide essential trading, lending, clearing and settlement functions, and the battle to compete in this underserved segment has ramped up significantly in recent months. The emergence of credible and capable prime service providers in the crypto world is critical.

As the market for digital assets grows, the number of trade breaks and security breaches may rise if the infrastructure doesn’t mature, making security and compliance existential priorities for trading venues. For instance, there was also a massive Bitcoin selloff on the BitMEX exchange in March: Nearly $200 million was chaotically liquidated with overleveraged traders unable to move money between networks in time to unwind their positions. And according to the Fidelity Digital Assets report, there were 11 exchange hacks in 2019 resulting in $283 million in digital assets stolen. While the total amount stolen has declined year over year, which indicates security improvements, the number of hacks has increased.

In the eyes of U.S. regulators, crypto businesses are virtual asset service providers that will soon be required to collect the names of transaction senders and receivers. They also must have AML policies and procedures in place. Indeed, crypto businesses have their work cut out to reconcile the morass of changing state, federal and cross-border rules. As market oversight remains fragmented and in flux, counterparties can be left holding the bag if a transaction goes awry.

Other industry-wide issues remain sticking points for institutions on the sidelines.

For one thing, digital asset identifiers aren’t consistent across platforms and exchanges, and there are often different tickers for the same instrument. In the absence of a central crypto market-data repository, trying to process transactions in downstream systems for valuations, pricing, accounting and reporting can create a host of problems. Indeed today, it is virtually impossible for investors and other stakeholders to consistently and reliably calculate true realized crypto gains and losses.

What are the industry needs now?

As this market segment grows and bigger blocks need to move between buyers and sellers, market participants need, more than ever, accurate market data and quality prime services such as lending, custody, margin, clearing and settlement to ensure customers have a safe environment in which to do business. More financial institutions will become active in this space once such concerns about regulatory uncertainty, market transparency, execution quality and capital efficiency are addressed. Fortunately, we are seeing evolutionary forces in crypto data management, rulemaking and reporting.

A host of new providers are creating systems so consumers of decentralized crypto data, such as banks and other institutions, can more easily and accurately reconcile accounting and reporting. Additionally, watchdogs are beginning to apply traditional market protections to the digital asset ecosystem. For its part, the recent OCC guidance is a blueprint that other agencies can follow to usher standards and safeguards that will enable these burgeoning markets to thrive in the months and years ahead.

Crypto businesses can navigate the rapidly changing business and regulatory landscapes by joining a number of highly active trade associations that are now shaping policy and industry change.

It behooves market participants to become as active as they can in these associations as policymakers define digital assets and how they should be regulated. There’s strength in numbers, so engaging with other crypto businesses in dialogue with regulators affords the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on this rapidly evolving segment before a policy is set in stone.

Keeping tabs on the nuance of change underway not only makes markets safer for all but can help financial services firms roll out potentially lucrative lines of business competitors may be pursuing, such as stablecoins for cross-border payments and crypto trading services. Eventually, today’s steep curve of market structure evolution will flatten, and digital assets will be commonly embraced. When that happens, those of us working diligently together now will be gratified to look back as agents of change.

In a new tweet, the crypto analyst tells his 68,000 followers that Ripple’s native token has the potential to massively increase one’s net worth in the coming years.

“Keep it real.

XRP price IS NOT ‘pre-determined.’

XRP IS NOT ‘backed by gold.’

XRP WILL NOT reach the prices BTC has ($10,000+).

XRP will NOT replace the dollar.

But it doesn’t need to do ANY of these things to make you and me life-changing money over the next 3 years.”

When asked to provide his price prediction for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, Credible explains why he believes XRP can skyrocket between $20 – $30 before the current bull market expires.

“…it’s gone 1000x+ in the last run, this would just be 100x. Regarding sell pressure, weak hands have long sold their XRP for other projects. The ones holding now won’t sell soon.”

“Don’t place your faith in XRP.”

Meanwhile, Credible is also looking at the short-term performance of Bitcoin. He says the presence of Bitcoin bulls at immediate support of $10,400 may likely send BTC close to $12,000.

BTC”",2020-10-04 00:00:00,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Does-Cryptocurrency-Really-Run-On-Clean-Energy.html,"In the past, cryptocurrency mining operations, especially that of Bitcoin, have gotten a lot of flack for consuming jaw-dropping amounts of energy. Bitcoin alone consumes more energy each year than the entire country of Switzerland.

To help illustrate the extremity of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, the University of Cambridge created an online tool that allows users to view Bitcoin’s energy consumption side by side with that of other entities. When this platform debuted, the tool showed that “Bitcoin is using around seven gigawatts of electricity, equal to 0.21% of the world's supply,” according to a BBC report, a figure that translates to “as much power as would be generated by seven Dungeness nuclear power plants at once.”

However, critics of these damning reports have argued that the energy consumption of Bitcoin and of cryptocurrencies, in general, are overly harsh and not entirely representative of the whole story. Yes, cryptocurrency consumes a huge amount of energy, the argument goes, but the majority of that energy comes from renewable resources.

Many of the arguments along these lines are based on the findings of a study from last year, which found that more than 74 percent of bitcoins are mined using renewable energy. Now, however, this study by cryptocurrency investment products and research firm CoinShares has come under scrutiny, and it seems that their estimate may have been overblown.

A new study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) took a closer look at the issue and came away with more nuanced, and in some cases, vastly different findings. The CCAF did find that there is considerable use of renewable resources in cryptocurrency mining operations. “76 percent of ‘hashers’ use renewable energy to power their activities, with hydropower the number one source at 62 percent. Wind and solar energy meanwhile are used by 17 percent and 15 percent respectively,” Finextra summed up the CCAF’s findings. (‘Hashers’ is the term preferred by CCAF over the more common term ‘miners’, as it is more accurate “to actors that are running mining equipment to generate hashes for finding a valid proof-of-work”).

But this is where the two studies diverge: “The CCAF’s report specifies that the 76% figure refers to the share of hashers who use renewable energy at any point. It estimates that only 39% of hashing’s total energy consumption comes from renewables.”

Related: The Start Of A New Oil Market Supercycle

Much of the divergence in this data comes from the Asia Pacific region, where a large portion of cryptocurrency mining operations are centered, and where cheap, coal-fired energy is extremely prevalent. The prominence of hydropower in the cryptocurrency energy mix also leads to periods of flux, as it can be highly dependent on external factors like the rainy season. When the rainy season ends, and hydropower becomes less affordable, these regions turn back to coal to power the grid, and thereby to power cryptocurrency mining.

In the meantime, many cryptocurrency operations are working to find a way to bring down their energy consumption and thereby their overall ecological footprint. “Mining is specifically a function of ‘proof of work’ cryptocurrencies, where participants in the network are rewarded with coins for adding new blocks to the chain,” explains Finextra. “To swerve this energy-intensive process, ‘proof of stake’ cryptos are now common, where users hold funds in the cryptocurrency in order to support the blockchain network’s operation. Ethereum, for example, is rebooting as Ethereum 2.0, following a staking model.”

As always, the picture for cryptocurrency’s relationship with energy is much more complicated than just one study can explain. It is easy to forget that data is subjective, and quantitative findings are highly contingent on the extremely human endeavors of research design, data collection, data representation, and interpretation. This is not to say that cryptocurrency investment products and research firms like CoinShares couldn’t put together an excellent study with useful data findings, but it does show the importance of questioning and examining the source of a study. The same goes for the CCAF, whose research will also almost certainly be improved and expanded upon going forward.

More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",,https://www.city-journal.org/technological-developments-new-systems-of-governance,"Throughout history, world powers—Spain, the Netherlands, France, Britain—have found themselves routinely replaced by more dynamic rivals. Today, many speculate about whether the United States will cede place to China as the global superpower. What if this is the wrong way to look at the question, though—and what if we’re living through a more radical transition? What if all contemporary states are in the process of being replaced by a new kind of “state,” as different from existing governments as they themselves differed from ancient empires or primitive tribes?

Technological development creates new sources of power, and it’s possible to discern a logic to that growth. First, information: Google knows more about you than your government ever will. Second, community: Facebook brings more people together on a single collective platform than any society, including China or India, can match. Third, currency: Bitcoin is a new kind of money, decentralized and free from political control. Fourth, law: smart contracts are computer programs working without human intervention. All that remains is to combine these elements, and a new form of governance will be born. What might it look like?

In an essay published in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg offers a philosophy of history to explain the rise of Facebook. The arc of that history moves from tribes to cities to nations—and now to something beyond. “Today we are close to taking our next step,” he writes. The truly remarkable thing is not that Zuckerberg thinks that humanity is becoming a global community—implausible as that claim is—but that he thinks his company, which he obviously does not regard as merely a company, can help make it happen: “Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community,” he says. “In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.”

When Zuckerberg calls Facebook the “social infrastructure” for community, the term is the very one that you would use to define the state. The state makes human communities possible; it builds them, organizes them, and keeps their members together. Or, as Zuckerberg puts it, it supports us, keeps us safe, informs us, and includes and engages us. Of course, Facebook, with no territory and no claims to territory, is dedicated to building a global community not in physical but in virtual space. By freeing itself from geographical constraints, this new community would be open to every person on the planet.

The story of the political travails affecting Facebook over the last few years—and to which Zuckerberg’s 2017 essay was an early response—shows that the aspiration to create a new kind of “state” was far tougher to realize than Zuckerberg envisioned. The problem is that Facebook lives a kind of double life. On the one hand, it says that it wants to enable a virtual community of global citizens. On the other, it is a company incorporated under the national law of already-existing nation-states. In this second aspect, it is subject both to the rules of market competition and to public regulations. Neither is compatible with the global political role to which Facebook aspires.

Cryptocurrencies—and crypto platforms more generally—offer an answer to this difficulty. Already, with Bitcoin, we have seen the advent of a new global infrastructure, where data and transactions can be endlessly recorded in a trusted blockchain ledger, without any of the usual intermediaries: no large multinational corporation captures the data, no banks are involved, and no state authority can tamper with the record. Disputes within the community are automatically settled by the existing ledger, which takes on the role of paramount authority.

As the media theorist Steven Johnson argues, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the Internet failed to understand that what was being built was a community, and not just a machine. Or perhaps the error was to think that identity had already been defined in the real world and that the online community would merely replicate those external standards. Offline, we rely on public authorities to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. Marital status, property, age, taxes, health and school records, contact information—state authorities zealously keep all these records, and, normally, a society will work better if citizens can trust those authorities to fulfill that task. But online, the scale of information explodes. The vast volume of data collected online now bears no comparison with the primitive records available in the physical world. Thus, identity changes online. Human beings are transformed into streams of data, which can be recorded, analyzed, and assessed in real time. Technology firms collect thousands of data points about each of us; the profiles they create are like virtual avatars, doubles of our real selves.

Since no Internet protocols were put into place for individual identity, and since those available in the physical world were of limited use, the private sector swooped in to fill the vacuum, settling on a number of proprietary standards for establishing who you are and whom you know, with Facebook increasingly occupying center place. I think it’s fair to say that things did not turn out well in this area. The new global community that Zuckerberg wanted to build was being powered by something as pedestrian as targeted advertising: the springs of community life now had to serve the purpose of maximizing profits for Facebook and its advertisers. “Surveillance capitalism,” as author Shoshana Zuboff calls it, carries the threat of vastly expanded private mechanisms of social control, based on rendering human behavior fully predictable. At the same time, the extraordinary power that the new technology platforms were amassing awakened the interest of government regulators, raising the likelihood that the dream of a new global community, independent of traditional state structures, would not survive its first trial.

That is why, for example, Facebook’s digital currency, Libra, seems destined to fail. No sooner was it announced than congressional hearings started, and the chairwoman of the Committee on Financial Services called on Facebook to halt its development. Unlike Bitcoin, Libra is centrally controlled by a particular firm, and thus an easy regulatory target.

An alternative is conceivable: each individual would own his digital identity, which different services could use according to their current interests and choices, instead of that identity being recorded and updated by large Internet platforms and then sold to advertisers without consulting the people to whom these online selves ultimately belong. With a distributed database of the kind first introduced by Bitcoin, something truly remarkable became possible for the first time: a community coming together with no other authority than the database that records its members’ collective lives. The ultimate promise of crypto lies less with digital currencies than with the replacement of other state structures. When programmer Vitalik Buterin started to think about the next stage of technological evolution after Bitcoin, his main intuition was that the blockchain could be used to record every social process, with money transactions being just one example.

Bitcoin’s main challenge was to create a simulacrum of time. To construct a database that would contain every transaction, present openness had to be brought together with past inviolability—it had to be possible, that is, to add new transactions to the ledger, while making every past act final or inviolable. The way that challenge has so far been addressed is with proof of work as a mechanism through which the nodes—the computers or servers that record the transactions—gain the right to participate in the system. The purpose is to make block creation—the process by which new transactions are successively added to the ledger—computationally difficult. In Bitcoin, this consists of solving a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function through trial and error.

“Bitcoin was a response to the excesses of financial markets and the unlimited power of the state.”

It’s the process of adding new transactions to the blockchain while getting rewarded for it with new bitcoins that we call “mining.” The metaphor is suggested by the computational difficulty, and thus the net cost of the process. As Bitcoin’s creator, the presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote: “The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.” Once the order of transactions has been secured in this way, and since the underlying cryptography protects the rest of the system, there is no way for a malicious attacker to appropriate funds that belong to someone else. Each person uses his or her own private key, and no amount of violence can solve a math problem.

As the record grows longer, any attempt to redo the earlier work becomes harder, to the point of impossibility, as it would also require redoing all the blocks chained after it. Besides, as Nakamoto cleverly pointed out—he is politically very subtle—if an attacker is somehow able to assemble more computational power than all the honest nodes in the chain, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new bitcoins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, which would favor him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. The blockchain backed by the largest quantity of proof of work—thus, the longest blockchain—is taken to be the definitive truth.

Nakamoto left a message in the first Bitcoin block ever mined, noting a headline in the Times of London announcing a second massive bailout for banks. The date: January 3, 2009, the height of the global financial crisis. Bitcoin was intended as a response to the distempers of a global financial system that somehow manages to give private companies free rein to enrich themselves, while keeping public authorities ultimately in charge. It was a response, in other words, both to the excesses of financial markets and to the unlimited power of the state. Nakamoto made a fundamental claim: the financial system as it exists today relies on trusted third parties, predominantly banks and other financial institutions, in order to function. This need for mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size, and thus cutting off the possibility for small, casual transactions. Further, nothing in the current system makes the record of assets and transactions inviolable. Fiat money remains under the ultimate control of governments. Financial crises show that this is not an idle consideration, but even under more routine circumstances, every government is prone to use monetary and fiscal tools to tamper with the historical record—the very record that Bitcoin enthusiasts regard as irreversible. People also want to do many things with money that politicians, bureaucrats, and political activists want to prevent them from doing. Cryptocurrencies come out of the efforts of “cypherpunks” to build a libertarian utopia in cyberspace using real computer science instead of fantasy physics. The goal, to a very great extent, is to strip money of dependence on, or even vulnerability to, governments.

Once a system of decentralized information and governance has been developed, money is only one area where public control may change hands. The universal record of transactions—the “sequence of events witnessed,” as Nakamoto calls it, or the “state transition system,” according to Buterin—could be used not just to move wealth around but also to take over certain roles of courts and, more generally, the laws. In short, anything that can currently be represented by a computer is admissible to the decentralized recording process. At this point, the logic behind the new technology becomes much clearer, even to the uninitiated.

Whether Nakamoto had these possibilities in mind when he created Bitcoin is open to debate. His paper is limited to the special case of an electronic currency, but that in itself is unsurprising. One would always have to start with money because all the people building, maintaining, and improving any radically decentralized system need to be rewarded for their efforts. Nakamoto devotes considerable attention to the classic problem of “incentives.”

Buterin proposed dropping the specialized approach of Bitcoin and building the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a programming language, allowing all people to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own rules for ownership, transaction formats, and state transition functions. He called the system “Ethereum.” Significantly, money becomes no longer just an output but also an input. All programmable computation in Ethereum is subject to fees. The fee schedule is specified in units of gas, and these can be bought using Ether, the system currency.

Smart contracts automatically process social and economic exchanges according to a predetermined algorithm. For example—as Buterin argued—one might have a contract of the form “A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together can withdraw anything, and A can block B from withdrawing.” Or think of a vending machine. Without a shop clerk or another trusted intermediary, it enforces the contract of selling a beverage at an advertised price to the customer, who inserts sufficient money into the till. The logical conclusion of this concept is decentralized autonomous organizations, smart contracts, or sets of contracts that contain the assets and encode the rules of an entire company or organization.

Just as a computer with no Internet connection has limited capabilities, so, too, do smart contract platforms that cannot connect to outside functions. As crypto takes on an increasing number of functions, however, one approaches a singularity: the moment when it no longer consists of an artificial system, separate from reality, but instead becomes the control room steering or governing events in the real world. From that point on, it would acquire at least some of the nature of a state.

Many issues related to the interface between Ethereum and the real world have been actively discussed and researched. In some cases, ingenious solutions have been advanced. Most deal with the ways in which the system may be made receptive to real-world inputs. Making it capable of producing outputs effective beyond the blockchain is a more demanding challenge.

Let’s start with the inputs and leave the outputs for a concluding—and more speculative—section. Ethereum promises its users a generalized system where they can do much more than just trade an internal currency. They can, for example, develop hybrid protocols connecting crypto-assets to conventional financial instruments. Stablecoins are crypto-assets backed by collateral linked to gold or the dollar. Synthetix, another Ethereum project, allows the creation of “synthetic assets,” whose prices can track currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. All these options require access to the market price of the asset being tracked. Insurance smart contracts will need data feeds related to the insurable event in question. For example, did the flight you had insurance for arrive on time? Trade-finance smart contracts would need data about shipments, supply chains, and customs for the goods being shipped, so as to confirm fulfillment of contractual obligations. The sources of information from the world outside the system are known as “oracles.”

The question immediately arises of how to design an oracle that does not falsify the logic of the system. Suddenly, the need to rely on a central authority to feed valuable data into the blockchain seems inescapable, but then we’re no longer operating a decentralized and unforgeable universal database; we’re back where we started. In 2019, for example, a Synthetix oracle transmitted false data to the platform, which a trading bot then exploited. Though no users were affected, Synthetix had to pay a significant sum to the bot owners to fix the unintentional hack.

Another illuminating example is a betting market, an application always presented as perfectly suited for the Ethereum blockchain. I could place a bet about, say, the name of the next American president as a smart contract that would automatically execute a money transfer once the election takes place. The advantages of a smart contract are obvious: I have no need to trust my counterpart or an intermediary, and there is no way to cancel or change the bet. The problem, of course, is how to feed the correct information of the election result to the smart contract. Many different solutions have been tried. One option: to create a decentralized oracle network, asking multiple nodes to fulfill the same request for data—that is, who won the election—and then reducing their reports to a median value before returning that answer to the smart contract. As Sergey Nazarov has argued, just as a smart contract needs to be extremely reliable to be useful, so the external data fed into the smart contract needs to be extremely reliable. What makes no sense is to have a centralized oracle feed data into a decentralized network.

According to the founder of Chainlink—one of the hottest companies in the crypto space right now—blockchains and oracles can both produce “definitive truth.” That is, the Bitcoin blockchain establishes definitive truth about Bitcoin ownership. Chainlink delivers definitive truth about the external world using the same basic method: multiple independent nodes confirm data from different, independent oracles. Similarly, in Augur, a decentralized betting platform, the consensus established by a body of “reporters” is considered the “truth” for the purpose of determining the prediction outcome.

Scraping web content for data might seem like a promising idea, but smart contracts can operate only in the blockchain they reside in. To communicate online, they need intermediaries, which is to say, oracles. A software oracle will draw important information needed for a smart contract to complete its task from various web sources. Conversely, a hardware oracle could be something like a sensor installed, say, to collect temperature data and deliver it to a smart contract for insurance.

We have now reached the crux of the matter. Because individual assets in such a system are protected by cryptographic keys, and the system itself is protected by a fully decentralized protocol, existing nation-states are increasingly finding it difficult to track or control the economic activities and transactions happening on the blockchain. If the state and the banking system cannot see the transactions in the new crypto economy, the ability to tax disappears. Tax rates for the rest of the economy will have to go up to compensate for the revenue loss, but the tax hike will likely drive more people to the crypto economy. And so on. It’s not surprising that crypto transactions first became part of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service tax-return form for 2019. Those pulling up the 2020 form will now see it almost immediately. Beneath the initial section for basic personal details is the fresh query: “At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

At first glance, this does not seem to be a sustainable dynamic for crypto. The nation-state still enjoys a monopoly of violence, after all. In fact, the blockchain has no access to violence. As Buterin once told me, if by control over physical violence, we mean the act of preventing it, there is indeed a growing toolbox of techniques, involving obfuscated smart-contract wallets, that make it tough for an attacker to use force to acquire crypto-assets. But if by control, one means the act of triggering violence, things get far more complicated. There is no obvious way by which a crypto system could acquire control over the use of violence in this sense, the defining trait of a modern state.

“If the state and banking system can’t see the transactions in the new crypto economy, the ability to tax disappears.”

But here are my provisional suggestions on how things could go. The critical issue is, of course, taxation. It is here that crypto issues the more determinate challenge to the core powers of the modern nation-state. Some in the crypto space believe that the slow erosion of the state’s tax powers will eventually determine its final collapse, at least as we know it today. Others have told me that they expect all nation-states to disappear over the coming decades, with the notable exception of China, which alone, they maintain, has the political and social resources to penetrate or disable fundamental choke points in the crypto system. China is responsible for something between half and two-thirds of global Bitcoin mining, but local authorities have made it clear that they regard the crypto space with enormous suspicion. In 2017, China banned fund-raising through initial coin offerings, and all digital-currency exchanges were shut down. If Beijing decides to cut off the Bitcoin network in China, it could make it hard for mining pools to sync their data on blockchain with the rest of the world.

The Chinese case does offer a possible template for the ongoing power rivalry between crypto and nation-states. In this scenario, crypto systems would double down on their technological superiority, while states would necessarily appeal to their secret weapon: the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force. But a second scenario seems much more plausible, at least outside China. Public authorities and crypto systems could reach a grand bargain or agreement, whereby the state would be able to tax crypto-assets in exchange for security guarantees for crypto. Legacy institutions and structures in the political world aren’t going away anytime soon, so it’s critical for blockchain projects to be able to interface with them. I believe that legacy systems can also benefit from this. The Swiss canton of Zug has taken initial steps in this direction: recently, it announced that beginning in 2021, taxes can be paid using Bitcoin and Ether.

One could even develop a form of smart contract—or chain of smart contracts—by which this agreement might be automated. A payment message routed to a centralized infrastructure processing tax revenue would be made dependent on the regular functioning of crypto exchanges and mining nodes. If the latter were closed, the output would be suspended or frozen. The solution would be akin to a “slashing” algorithm, where a node is penalized if it acts in a malicious or detrimental way toward the network or if it undermines protocol guarantees. Slashing events usually involve a combination of the partial or total burning of locked funds or their temporary or permanent removal from the network.

What if slashing meant state slashing? Some would conclude that the coercive apparatus of the nation-state had been effectively absorbed by the system—the successor state.",2020-10-13 09:03:09-04:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-ada-xmr-atom-vet,"Investors are concerned about the stability of the cryptocurrency market after it was faced with a flurry of adverse news in the past few days.

Fortunately, the markets have matured to the extent that negative news no longer provokes wild price swings like they once did in crypto’s early days.

The current stability shows that institutional investors do not consider the recent KuCoin hack, CFTC and DOJ charges against BitMEX, or even President Donald Trump being diagnosed with coronavirus as serious enough events to crash the crypto markets.

Therefore, there was no panic liquidation in Bitcoin (BTC) futures after the news broke and the open interest remained stable.

In a bullish trend, traders use price weakness caused by knee-jerk reactions to add to their positions. If Bitcoin continues to sustain above the psychologically critical level at $10,000, more investors may consider adding to their portfolios.

Despite Bitcoin’s sideways price action, a few altcoins have maintained their uptrend and others are showing signs of a possible bullish trend reversal.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to see which critical levels may signal the start of a trending move.

BTC/USD

The long-term trend in Bitcoin is bullish as the 200-day simple moving average ($9,448) is sloping up. However, in the short-term, the flat 20-day exponential moving average ($10,682) and the relative strength index close to the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The BTC/USD pair is currently stuck between $9,835 and $11,178 for the past few days. A break above or below this range could start a trending move.

Between May and July, the pair had remained stuck in a tight range for almost 80 days and the current consolidation has completed about 30 days.

If history were to repeat itself, then the price may remain range-bound for a few more days. Hence, traders should be patient until the price breaks above or below the range.

A breakout of $11,178 could start a rally with the first target objective at $12,460, while a break below $9,835 and the 200-day SMA may intensify selling as traders rush to the exit to dump their positions.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle. A breakout between half to three-fourths of the distance from the base of the triangle to the apex is considered as reliable.

Therefore, the bulls and the bears might attempt a breakout of the triangle within the next few days. However, if that does not happen and the price reaches the apex of the triangle, then the pattern will be invalidated.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) closed (UTC time) below the 200-day SMA ($0.0837) on Sep. 23 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels, and the altcoin climbed back above the long-term moving average on Sep. 24.

ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

This suggests that the bulls are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA. The price action of the past few days is showing a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern formation that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the neckline.

The pattern target of this setup is $0.1331. This bullish view will come into play only after the price breaks out of the neckline.

Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the current level or the neckline and drops below the 200-day SMA, it will invalidate the pattern. This could attract aggressive selling with the next support at $0.050.

ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are struggling to push the price above the $0.1040440 overhead resistance. This shows that the bears are selling on relief rallies to this resistance.

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in negative territory suggest that bears have a slight advantage in the short-term. If the price dips below $0.0898, the bears will try to sink the price to the critical support at $0.074.

Conversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the moving averages, a move to $0.1040440 and then to the neckline is possible.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) broke above the $97.70 overhead resistance on Sep. 29 and the retest of the breakout level was successful on Oct. 2. This shows that the level that was previously acting as a stiff resistance is now acting as a strong support.

XMR/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The rising 20-day EMA ($97.15) and the RSI in the positive territory suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The first target is $113.211 and above it $121.427.

Momentum is likely to pick up if the bulls can push the price above this level and the next target is at $140.

This positive view will be invalidated if the XMR/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $93. Such a move could pull down the price to the 200-day SMA at $71.79.

XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has largely been trading inside a channel for the past few days. Although the price broke above the channel, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels and the pair dropped to the support line of the channel.

However, the rebound from the support line has been strong and the bulls are once again trying to push the price above the channel. If they succeed, the momentum could pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to breakout of the channel, then a gradual up-move is likely. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the channel.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) is showing signs of a possible reversal as it has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the neckline.

ATOM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

This setup has a target objective of $7.4 and if this level is crossed, the up-move can retest the highs at $8.877.

However, the 20-day EMA ($5) is currently flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. Therefore, traders may wait for the price to break above the neckline before turning positive.

If the ATOM/USD pair turns down from the neckline, a drop to $4.50 and below it to the 200-day SMA ($3.675) is possible.

ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls purchased the dip to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from $3.78–$5.596. The buyers will now try to push the price back above $5.596.

If they achieve the breakout and sustain it, the inverse head and shoulders pattern will complete.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance and drops below the 61.8% retracement level of $4.474. Such a move could drag the price down to $3.78.

VET/USD

The bulls have been defending the $0.01094 support for the past few days but they have failed to sustain the higher levels, which suggests that bears are selling on rallies. Hence, VeChain (VET) has again dropped back to the $0.01094 support.

VET/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bears sink the VET/USD pair below $0.01094 support and the 200-day SMA ($0.0104), the selling is likely to intensify and a drop to $0.008 and below it to $0.0066 is possible.

The 20-day EMA ($0.0128) is sloping down and the RSI has not been able to sustain above 50, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.

This negative view will be invalidated if the pair again rebounds off the support and rises above $0.0160. Such a move will suggest accumulation by the bulls at lower levels.

VET/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $0.010940. This setup has a target objective of $0.00328.

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand in the short-term.

This view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off $0.010940 and rises above the downtrend line of the triangle.

In brief Reddit is trialing crypto-based community points for a popular Fortnite subreddit.

You can convert those points for cash.

The road is long and hard.

Regulars of the 1-million-strong Fortnite subreddit can trade their crypto-based community points—earned from contributions such as memes, high-quality comments, and fan-made art—for cash.

Reddit has trialed cryptocurrency rewards on the community-run subreddit for Fortnite, r/FortNiteBR, as well as on r/CryptoCurrency, since May.

The subreddit’s cryptocurrency, “Bricks”, runs on a test version of Ethereum known as “Rinkeby.” Testnet coins aren’t supposed to have value; indeed, you can request the Rinkeby version of Ethereum tokens for free.

Still, it’s possible to sell the Bricks on a new decentralized exchange, Honeyswap. There, the coins have real value. Granted, not much: a single brick is worth $0.03, and a single transaction costs $8.89.

The thing is, it’s really complicated to sell these coins and those transaction fees may not make it worth your while. It’s also slightly easier, though still very complicated, to sell the MOON cryptocurrency earned on r/CryptoCurrency because people have written software that makes the whole thing less of a minefield.

The Fortnite experiment is more popular. According to DappRadar, 36,770 Brick holders have made 65,291 transfers. On r/CryptoCurrency, there are 7,973 holders of MOONs and 16.748 transfers.

How to sell your BRICKs

Selling Bricks is far from simple, but here’s the nuts and bolts of it, per a guide on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit:

First, send Bricks to your MetaMask wallet. MetaMask is a popular browser-based crypto wallet. You’ll have to add BRICK as a custom token in your wallet, using the following address: “0xe0d8d7b8273de14e628d2f2a4a10f719f898450a”.

Second, you’ll need to get some cryptocurrency to pay the gas fees. You pay gas fees to the network to process your transaction.

For this, you’ll need some Rinkeby ETH—remember, you can get that for free—and some xDAI. xDAI is a version of DAI, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin. This is a cryptocurrency whose value is equal, more or less, to the US dollar. You can swap DAI for xDAI. xDAI is the same as DAI, only it’s based on an Ethereum sidechain.

Third, you’ll have to convert your Bricks to tokens supported by the xDAI sidechain. That means you’ll have to convert them to xBricks. To do this, enter the Rinkeby address for Bricks (above) in MyEtherWallet, and paste this in the ABI/JSON interface:

Instead of “spender”, put this: “0xD925002f88279776dEB4907bA7F8dC173e2EA7a7”. Instead of “value”, enter the number of BRICK tokens you want to convert in wei. Wei is a unit of Ethereum gas. One BRICK = 1000000000000000000 wei. Then click write and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.

Then put the above contract address in address and then paste the following in the ABI/JSON Interface:

Continue, select an item, pick relayTokens, put your address in ""receiver"", in ""_value"" enter the ""a7"" address mentioned above, then write and convert on MetaMask. Then switch to xDai and add xBRICK using x2f9ceBf5De3bc25E0643D0E66134E5bf5c48e191 as the contract address.

Then, you can sell it on Honeyswap, and then from there cash out. To cash out, convert these tokens back into regular tokens (xDAI to DAI), and from there sent to an exchange and withdraw to fiat.

530 reads

@ SenorDunnCrypto Laurie Dunn All things Crypto/Blockchain have become a passion for me.

As Kucoin, international law enforcement, and crypto security companies continue to size up the extent of last Saturday’s hack, several crypto projects, victims of the attack, have each implemented measures in order to minimise their losses and address the situation.

As each project takes stock of their losses in the upwards of $200 million in stolen assets, they have taken varying courses of action in order to reduce the blow to themselves and to their investors. It can be said that the rapidity of the Kucoin hack announcement, and the professional way the affected projects reacted, has led to some quite reasonable damage limitation.

Tether flexes its muscles

One of the biggest dollar equivalents in tokens utilised by the hackers was in USDT, the most prevalent stable coin. Bitfinex froze 13M Tether on the EOS blockchain and Tether itself froze 20M as a precaution on a suspect Ethereum address.

In addition, Tether froze 1M USDT on Omni and a further 1M on the Tron blockchain. It’s not clear whether Tether plans to burn these tokens but it seems that centralisation does have its advantages given that Tether was able to freeze these tokens quickly and without greatly impacting their business.

Ocean Protocol initiates hard fork

Ocean Protocol and its token holders stood to lose more than 21 million OCEAN which approximates to around $8.6 million. However, a ‘pause function’ in the smart contract enabled the team to complete a hard fork.

A new version of the Ocean smart contract has been set up so that token balances stolen in the hack can be apportioned to an address held in trust in Singapore for those who lost OCEAN in the attack.

Even though third parties cannot be obliged to recognise the new contract address, it can be imagined that given the vast amount of sympathy and community support for projects who were targeted, it will only be a matter of time before this hard fork is fully recognised.

NOIA Network token swap

NOIA lost 81 million tokens and once this was realised by the team they swung into action to resolve the situation. Parsiq, are quoted by the team as helping to take a snapshot of the token balances in all wallets.

Following this, NOIA has reissued all tokens 1:1 by way of a new smart contract. All the new tokens have already been distributed by Kucoin, without holders having to do anything, and the old smart contract address, as well as previous tokens will now be disused. Other exchanges have been notified but holders are advised to check themselves that support for the new contract is up-and-running for each exchange.

VIDT Datalink — a new and evolved smart contract

The Team at VIDT Datalink have managed to roll with the hack and have decided to issue a new version smart contract. It was fortunate that the team had been working on this for a number of months already, so when the opportunity presented itself they were able to quickly roll out a new smart contract with brand new B2B and B2C NFT functionality and Binance Smart Chain compatibility.

The new smart contract is issued on October 2nd and all VIDT token holders will receive new VIDT 1:1 in their existing wallets.

The VIDT team have turned this drawback into an advantage by acting quickly and in the best interests of their holders. The 14M VIDT that was stolen will now be obsolete and the holders reimbursed with the new tokens. A further 400K VIDT will be burned which came from airdrops where applicants did not complete KYC or bounty assignments.

Implementation of the new smart contract will add very important functionality to the VIDT business given the B2B NFT’s, compatible with the Binance Smart Chain, and enabling completely new use cases for the VIDT technology.

The new Smart Contract will also reduce gas fees and more functionality will be added to streamline B2C applications.

Conclusion

Kucoin, a top tier exchange, is yet another victim of the copious amount of exchange hacks that have taken place over recent years in crypto. However, we have definitely moved on a long ways since the days of Mt Gox, so as long as important lessons have been learnt here, in the grand scheme of things, not too much harm has been done.

Another light at the end of the tunnel is how the crypto projects themselves are adapting to these hacks and how they are becoming more resilient to nullifying the greater part of their losses. The fact that DEXs cannot freeze assets meant that the projects had to react extremely quickly and do this themselves.

It was also good to see how the crypto community came together and exchanges and projects offered each-other support and first-hand help in order to minimise losses. I see a much stronger spirit of togetherness emerging in the space as it dawns on all that an attack on one exchange or crypto project is an attack on the crypto space as a whole.

The SEC accuses McAfee of being paid more than $23.1 million worth of cryptocurrency assets for promoting a number of ICO token sales without disclosing that he was being paid to do so. Furthermore the DOJ has levied a number of counts of tax evasion against McAfee, saying that he “willfully attempted to evade” payment of income taxes owed to the federal government.

In a brief announcing the arrest and unsealing of indictment documents, the DOJ also details that the charges are confined to McAfee the individual and that they did not find any connection with the “anti-virus company bearing his name.”

The DOJ’s charges against McAfee are a bit dry, but detail 10 counts against the entrepreneur. McAfee faced five counts of tax evasion, which each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, as well as five counts of “willful failure to file a tax return,” each carrying a maximum penalty of one year in prison.

The SEC filing is a much more interesting read, with 55 pages detailing a lengthy investigation into McAfee’s alleged fraudulent activity promoting a number of ICOs throughout 2017 and 2018. The report specifically notes that McAfee allegedly received more than $11.6 million worth of BTC and ETH tokens for promoting seven ICOs. Unfortunately, those offerings were not named in the suit. He additionally received $11.5 million worth of the promoted tokens, the suit alleges.

Out of that segment, Mexico has captured almost 11% of all retail crypto payments since July 2019.

El Economista cited research by Daniel Cartolin, a development representative from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which showed that the region has received $24 million in retail crypto transactions and sent $25 million to other continents over the past year.

The representative highlighted that remittances and trade are sectors with a major presence in retail crypto transactions within Latin America. The country's strong ties with both North America and Asia make the flow of these retail transactions possible, the study says. It also noted that most of these transactions are performed using Bitcoin (BTC).

Cartolin also said that crypto is often used for remittances through out Mexico:

""Remittances in the traditional world are substantial between the United States and Mexico, and we are beginning to see areas where cryptocurrency is beginning to be adopted for remittances, because there are fewer fees when it comes to exchanging cryptocurrencies and the person does not have to go to sites like Western Union or Moneygram to do the operation, it can be done from a phone.""

Though Mexico is leading the way when it comes to retail crypto transactions, Venezuela remains the leader in Latin America in terms of crypto adoption, according to a research published by the blockchain firm in September.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-for-congress-bitcoin/,"Crypto for Congress: Bitcoin Sent to All Congress Members' Campaigns

The Crypto for Congress initiative has launched. All members of Congress will be given bitcoin as campaign contributions to help them learn about cryptocurrency. The initiative is supported by Congressional Blockchain Caucus members, including pro-crypto Representatives Darren Soto and Tom Emmer.

Each Congress Member Receiving Bitcoin Contribution

The “Crypto for Congress” initiative has launched, the Chamber of Digital Commerce announced Monday. “Today, all members of the United States Congress will receive a campaign contribution in bitcoin” as part of this initiative, the announcement details. There are 535 members of Congress: 100 serve in the U.S. Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives.

The Chamber of Digital Commerce Political Action Committee will provide a $50 bitcoin contribution to all 535 members of Congress. The organization also provides online public educational training, a toolkit, and various resources to Congress members across all parties “to help them engage directly in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” the announcement explains. According to information on the initiative’s website:

Crypto for Congress is an educational initiative aimed at expanding the use and adoption of digital assets among Congressional candidates, elected leaders, and engaged citizens.

“Now is the moment for all members of Congress to learn about and embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and the best way to do that is to set up a digital wallet and get started on the blockchain journey,” said Perianne Boring, the organization’s founder and president. “Many other nations like China, Japan, Singapore and Switzerland have rapidly embraced blockchain technology and created robust national plans to be global leaders in this area. The United States is falling behind in technological innovation and this is not a risk we should be willing to take.”

The Crypto for Congress initiative is supported by members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, including pro-cryptocurrency Representatives Darren Soto and Tom Emmer. Sponsors of the newly launched initiative include Anchorage, Bitpay, Blockfi, CMT Digital, Circle, Civic, Etoro, Flipside Crypto, Medici Ventures, Messari, and Paxos.

“Crypto for Congress brings an opportunity for our entire Congressional community to join this generational shift in finance and technology,” Rep. Tom Emmer commented. “By embracing the digital asset movement, we have an opportunity to take a significant step forward to ensure America’s leadership position in the future of the global economy.”

BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.

BitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs price has been on a steady rise since Saturday, topping out at $10,775 Monday on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. Cindy Leow, portfolio manager for 256 Capital Partners, a multi-strategy trading firm, notes bitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs capacity to rebound from recent unpleasant news. Ã¢ÂÂBitcoin has quickly recovered from back-to-back news about the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and the Department of JusticeÃ¢ÂÂs indictment against BitMEX as well as news of [Pres. Donald] Trump contracting COVID, speaking to its short-term resilience.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ

Despite bitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs bounceback, Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund-of-funds BitBull Capital, is concerned as the derivatives market indicates many traders are still sitting out. Ã¢ÂÂBitcoin has been stuck in a $10,000-$11,000 channel for the last month,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂLending yields have fallen across the board as investors await the return of volatility and measure the potential impacts of BitMEXÃ¢ÂÂs stunning downfall.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ

A sign of distress can be seen by comparing bitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs funding rates with those of competitors. Funding rates are fees paid by one side of a futures contract to the other. When theyÃ¢ÂÂre positive, it usually reflects bullish sentiment, while negative rates are bearish.

But BitMEXÃ¢ÂÂs negative funding rate might be a sign that investors are leaving the venue, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.

BitMEXÃ¢ÂÂs funding rate is currently aroundÃÂ -0.0124%, while funding rates for major competitors have been at or close to zero for the past three days.ÃÂ ÃÂ

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a function of unwinds,Ã¢ÂÂ Shah said. Ã¢ÂÂLong positions are coming unwound to an extent, open interest has fallen materially, as expected.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThis makes BitMEX a relatively cheaper venue for BTC-denominated players to gain topside leverage,Ã¢ÂÂ Shah said. Ã¢ÂÂBut that discount isnÃ¢ÂÂt material; youÃ¢ÂÂd have to justify the risk for a 5-10% annualized gain given the regulatory overhang.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ

While many investors are justifiably losing interest in BitMEX due to its looming legal issues, bitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs dominance, its market share in relation to the total crypto capitalization, has been bouncing back from 2020 lows in September.

Dominance starting to trend upwards could affect price, especially if there is sell pressure on both bitcoin and altcoins, said 256 CapitalÃ¢ÂÂs Leow. Ã¢ÂÂWhile this may seem bullish for BTC, it is also a cautionary signal: When low-cap alts dump while BTC stays flat, BTC tends to follow suit in the short-term.Ã¢ÂÂ

Daily Ethereum fees drop

Fees on Ethereum totalled 5,560 ETH Saturday, the lowest amount spent on the network since August 8. Used to conduct transactions and interact with smart contracts that constitute decentralized finance or DeFi, Ethereum fees have been hitting all-time highs as of late. On Sept. 17, for example, a record 42,763 ETH in fees were paid to miners.

Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, an investment firm, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt expect Ethereum fees, also known as gas, to stay low. Ã¢ÂÂI suspect this is a temporary lull only as the structural issue of the gas costs has not gone away,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Traders could take advantage of the respite in fees to rebalance, Bonnefous noted. Ã¢ÂÂIt may be a good time to readjust portfolios at a cheaper cost.Ã¢ÂÂ

Charles Schwab has begun purchasing shares of Riot Blockchain, joining Fidelity and Vanguard – already investors in Riot, HIVE Blockchain Technologies, Hut 8 and BC Group – in allocating mutual fund holdings to a cryptocurrency company, according to financial filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The stock purchases also double down on the mutual fund managers’ equity investments and experiments in the space. Schwab this summer invested in Alchemy, an Ethereum application platform, while Vanguard has been piloting Symbiont’s blockchain for foreign exchange transactions, and Fidelity has a digital assets arm – set to launch a trading service and a bitcoin index fund – and has backed Coin Metrics, Fireblocks and Everledger.

Riot Blockchain, based in the U.S., and HIVE Blockchain Technologies, based in Canada, provide services for mining bitcoin, a process where new cryptocurrency is minted.

Outside the U.S., a third Fidelity fund – Fidelity International – first acquired this year 10,451,094 shares valued at $1.80 each of Hut 8, a Canadian bitcoin mining company, and 17 million shares priced at HK$6.50 (US$8.30) of BC Group, a Hong Kong-based digital asset platform, earlier filings indicate.

The Riot shares in the two Vanguard funds and a third Vanguard fund – the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund – are back up from the last three years, which ended with them holding a combined 269,610 shares for $7,912,000 in 2017, 187,049 shares for $282,000 in 2018 and 826,391 shares for $925,000 in 2019.

Holdings also ticked up again for the Fidelity fund invested in Riot – the Fidelity Concord Street Trust – which bought 188,277 shares for $1,185,607 ending in 2018 and 159,263 shares for $270,375 ending in 2019. They dipped for the Fidelity Securities Fund invested in HIVE, with 5,792,880 shares for $82,433,000 ending in 2017, 4,972,700 shares for $821,000 ending in 2018 and 2,784,259 shares for $367,980 ending in 2019.

The Blackstone Group’s Alternative Investment Funds were also holding Riot Blockchain stock last year, but stopped including it in their portfolios.",2020-10-05 19:00:59+00:00,https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banks-are-permitted-to-hold-crypto-assets-will-they,"Banks regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were given the go-ahead by regulators in July to hold customers’ digital assets. But so far, no OCC-regulated banks have done so. What’s holding them back?

One factor seems to be lack of clarity around exactly what banks are allowed to do and the risks therein.

The concept of custody isn’t so complicated when it comes to cash held at a bank. Account deposits are assets that are owned and controlled by the bank, while items in a safety deposit box more directly belong to the customer.

“The cash in my bank account isn’t exactly my money,” said Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “It’s a claim against the bank.”

Bills in a safety deposit box would be “your money, but physically stored at the bank,” Routledge said. “You get the old-fashioned vaults and the big thick doors, but it’s not an asset of the bank.”

The concept gets murkier when extended to banks assuming custody over cryptocurrency.

The OCC issued an interpretive letter in July confirming that bank custody services could include holding cryptographic keys and other crypto-related assets, in response to a query from an unnamed bank.

This clarification applies to federally chartered banks. Currently, companies that receive Wyoming’s special-purpose depository institution charter and trust companies in some states can offer digital asset custody services.

“The OCC is trying to get in front of cutting-edge issues by clarifying that national banks can offer services related to crypto where the states have already provided such clarification to state-chartered banks,” said Paul Clark, partner at Seward & Kissel LLP, which has offices in New York and Washington.

Customers are likely to be institutional rather than individual investors in cryptocurrency. Registered investment advisers, for example, may prefer holding crypto assets with a full-service bank, which can provide loans and other services, rather than with a trust company.

Banks might decide to offer crypto custody if it helps them keep institutional clients who are looking for it and they can use it as a marketing tactic to attract new clients. Collecting fees to store these assets could be another incentive.

There are a number of considerations as to when it makes sense for a bank to exercise this power. Although most banks are mum about their intentions, experts agree that they would need sufficient demand from customers to justify the time, resources and technology needed to safely hold these assets.

Many are also wary of the risks of cryptocurrency in general, according to recent research.

A global survey conducted by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists and the Royal United Services Institute found that 35% of respondents from financial institutions felt that the primary use of cryptocurrency was for illicit transactions, and 70% worry that holding cryptocurrency could expose their institution to criminal activity such as money laundering.

Several large banks declined to comment or did not respond when asked about their plans to hold these assets.

Roger Cabrera, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said in a statement: “Wells Fargo is committed to exploring emerging technologies, but as with all emerging technologies, understanding the regulatory environment and ensuring customer privacy and security are foundational elements of this exploration. While we do not accept crypto assets — in deposit, custodial, or other accounts — we will continue to evaluate the underlying technology for potential transactional, transparency, and settlement innovations it may hold.”

But the interest exists.

Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, a New York financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector, said: “On an international and domestic basis, we’ve seen senior level interest from large custodial, commercial and investment banks for many years with respect to cryptocurrency custody, trading and management. The custodial piece is viewed as the foundation with which other services can be built or added.”

The deciding factor for many financial institutions will be whether their clients are demanding the service. Banks would need to invest in technology to hold crypto assets and develop robust anti-money- laundering systems that would satisfy the OCC, said Clark, the Seward & Kissel partner.

“Suffice it to say that it will be limited to banks that believe there is a sufficiently large market to warrant the investment,” said Clark. “It’s not clear that that market yet exists.”

There is also a learning curve when it comes to securely offering custody of cryptocurrency assets, and it’s unlikely a bank that hasn’t already dabbled in cryptocurrency custody will enter the field in the short term.

“The main import of the letter is it will make internal conversations with management and compliance easier,” said Anthony Tu-Sekine, another partner at Seward & Kissel.

Chris Ferraro, president of Galaxy Digital, said that rather than buy or build infrastructure to hold cryptocurrency assets, most banks would opt to white label the service from an existing custodian. For instance, Coinbase and Gemini provide crypto custody.

“If a bank can put its brand, balance sheet and reputation as a wrapper around the track record and know-how of an existing [custodian], they may see that as the right way to go to market as opposed to building it all in house,” Ferraro said.

Ferraro said the OCC's letter could signal the intent eventually to launch a central bank digital currency. China is planning to launch a digital version of its currency, while the European Central Bank will soon start experimenting with a digital version of the euro.

Clarifying that federally regulated banks can custody crypto assets, Ferraro said, “is the first step in a very long cascade of events that would have to happen for the U.S. to eventually issue its own currency that is natively digital.”

Another is a software engineer with nowhere to go during the pandemic. There’s also an editor for a data site and a fund manager who invests in digital assets.

What these people have in common is an obscure side gig known as “yield farming,” a type of cryptocurrency trading and investing that didn’t really even exist until 2020. Yield farming is producing fixed-income-like returns that can, at least for brief stretches, provide annualized interest rates equivalent to percentages investors cannot find anywhere else.

Yield farming, simply put, is when cryptocurrency holders sock digital assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) or dollar-linked tokens like tether (USDT) and dai (DAI) into blockchain-based, semi-autonomous lending and trading platforms in exchange for additional tokens as rewards. In the fast-growing subsegment of the crypto industry known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, yield farming offers a quicker and more lucrative way of making money than, say, parking extra dollars in a JPMorgan Chase savings account at a paltry 0.01% interest rate.

The yield farming DeFi boom started in June when the DeFi projects Compound and Aave launched. They were soon followed by Kyber, Balancer and Yearn.Finance. More creative names like Spaghetti, Tendies and SushiSwap followed.

Partly because cryptocurrency traders realized they could make so much money simply from using the protocols, the growth has been staggering: Since June, these systems have mushroomed eightfold, with a total of $11 billion of crypto collateral locked into them according to DeFi Pulse. According to the site DeFi Rate, it is possible to net an annual percentage yield of more than 53% APY staking crypto on lender Fulcrum – and sometimes much more on new projects for those who get in early.

But who are these yield farmers? Why have they flocked to this arcane corner of the digital-asset industry and how did they learn how it all works? Is it a full-time or part-time endeavor? How insanely risky is all this?

CoinDesk talked to several yield farmers to get their stories.

The artist

André Allen Anjos, also known as RAC, is a music producer and recording artist with over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, winning a Grammy in 2015 for Best Remixed Recording. “I discovered Ethereum around late 2016,” he said.

In 2017, Anjos worked with the ConsenSys-backed Ujo Music to sell the first full-length album of music via Ethereum’s blockchain. Fans sent ether to a smart contract on the blockchain, and the album’s files were hosted on the decentralized interplanetary file system, or IPFS, a distributed storage system.

Just as Anjos was getting involved with the crypto-verse, by 2018 cryptocurrency prices came crashing down. Interest in the space waned, but Anjos stuck with it. He learned about a DeFi project called MakerDAO and was quickly captivated by the concept of collateral locked into the software protocol to create dollar-linked stablecoins called dai. “That was my entry to what we call DeFi,” Anjos says. “At the time there wasn’t really a name for it.”

The irregular schedule of a music-maker lends Anjos ample hours to explore yield farming. “I’m obviously a musician,” he said. “That’s what I do full time. Because of my job, my day-to-day is pretty loose. I can kind of do whatever I want.” That includes spending time on social media and reading up on new DeFi projects. “You pull up Twitter and everyone’s freaking about Yams,” Anjos said, referring to one DeFi yield-farming project that exploded in popularity in August before quickly flaming out once a bug was discovered in the unaudited software protocol.

Spend a few minutes chatting with Anjos and it gets deep into the weeds pretty fast. He’s fascinated by the stablecoin decentralized exchange Curve. “It’s a pool of stable tokens and it’s on a more efficient bonding curve.”

Yield farmers like Anjos are able to reap trading fees from the exchange in return for providing their tokens as liquidity. Other cryptocurrency users can then borrow them to deploy in trades, or even engage in another round of yield farming.

“Curve generates a fair amount of fees, which then go to the pool, which attracts more attention,” Anjos says. More recently, Anjos has become obsessed with a Curve copycat called Swerve; he recently Tweeted that while his traditional bank account reduced savings-account interest rates to zero, the project Swerve was offering 250% returns.

Anjos continues to think of ways to use DeFi in music. He recently sold 100 limited-edition tokenized cassettes called $TAPE of his newest album via Ethereum with help from a startup called Zora. “I think there’s a lot of opportunity to do something in music,” said Anos. “We’re sort of riddled with intermediaries. It’s kind of like the perfect use case.”

The daytripper

Arising early and firing up a MacBook Pro, a yield farmer who goes by “devops199fan” on Twitter checks his feed. He’s on the prowl for new ways to make money in DeFi.

Finding the opportunities means spending a lot of time on Twitter. Devops199fan follows about 144 people ranging from Robert Leshner, founder of the DeFi lender Compound, to pseudonymous actors like himself such as Hasu, a researcher with almost 30,000 followers. Then it is over to the website Yieldfarming.info, which has a terminal-like user interface providing a wealth of resources.

“At any given time, there are a bunch of different opportunities that are available,” devops199fan told CoinDesk via videoconference, speaking on condition that his real name not be used. “And then as time is going on, more and more opportunities are launching.”

It’s still a part-time gig. Devops199fan has a day job as a software engineer and he doesn’t intend to quit, despite the fact that his profits from yield farming are becoming a more significant part of his income. The coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns have meant work from home for devops199fan, and there are long hours in quarantine sequester for the pursuit, which he still considers a hobby.

Devops199fan particularly likes a DeFi platform called Yearn.Finance, which directs users toward profitable opportunities by aggregating various projects and taking a cut in return. “It’s one of the coolest things to happen in DeFi,” according to devops199fan.

The troopa

Cooper Turley was working as a writer and editor for the website DeFi Rate when the yield-farming craze hit. “I was just trying to figure out what the next trend in crypto is, sort of at the end of the bear market,” said Turley, also known Coopertroopa on Twitter. “The yield farming thing started coming to my attention with Synthetix when they were doing their liquidity trial,” he said, referring to a DeFi project that serves as an automated manufacturer of cryptocurrency derivatives.

Cooper said the amount of yield doesn’t matter when he’s plowing crypto into a project.

“It’s more about the legitimacy of the farm that’s presented – basically the people who are either behind it or sort of the amount of time that was put into curating whatever the product is,” he said.

Cooper usually spends a couple hours researching new projects to make sure they’re legit. Getting in at the beginning is key.

“That’s kind of the weird nature of these opportunities popping up is that those first 24 hours are by far the most lucrative,” Cooper said.

Most projects offer extra-juicy token rewards during the first few days. “So literally like getting in in that first hour or so can actually make a world of difference for what returns you’re getting on your capital,” he said.

The nominal interest rates often look high, sometimes 1,000% or upward, because they’re only available for short spurts. “The reason why SushiSwap was so hot is because there were 10-to-one rewards for the first week,” he said.

“I think just cycling into new farms as they pop up and sort of getting that first window has proven to be the most lucrative opportunity for the vast majority of these products,“ he added.

The fund manager

Even professional cryptocurrency investors are getting into yield farming. Jake Brukhman is managing partner of the five-year-old digital-asset investment firm CoinFund, which puts money directly into various crypto projects but also yield farms.

As of September, according to Brukhman, about 20% of CoinFund’s liquid portfolio was devoted to yield farming and liquidity mining.

“The liquidity profile of tokens is now significantly better than it was a few years ago,” said Brukhman, a Brooklyn, N.Y., resident who has been following and investing in crypto for well over half a decade. “A few years ago, it was very hard to get a token listed on a centralized exchange,” he added.

Now, liquidity is easy: Any Ethereum-based token can easily be listed on a number of decentralized exchanges. The trend has provided a foundation for the growth of yield farming.

Brukman defines yield farming as “optimizing yield across many yield opportunities, sometimes by stacking them on the same capital.”

In March 2018, CoinFund launched Grassfed Network for what it called “generalized mining strategies,” defined as “crypto economic games implemented by decentralized protocols that users can play to earn cryptocurrency-denominated compensation.” Essentially, it was an early iteration of yield farming. Even the most die-hard yield farmers will acknowledge that it all does feel like a big game, played with digital tokens but with real-money equivalents.

Brukhman is a fan of decentralized exchanges like Balancer because providing liquidity in return for fees charged on the exchange is the best yield farming play on the market today – also known as liquidity mining.

When Brukhman talks about yield farming, it’s with a casual, matter-of-fact stream of DeFi lingo that almost obscures the fact that none of this really even existed until recently. “Anyone can go on the supply side of these protocols and provide liquidity for some of these assets,” he said. “With Uniswap version 2 it’s only two assets per pool. With Balancer, you can provide up to eight assets per pool.”

It’s all part of the job.

The risk factor

While this may seem very ephemeral, yield farming could result in promising developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Nonetheless, each yield farmer told CoinDesk the same thing: This stuff is really, really risky.

“I’m sure there’s all kinds of risks that we don’t really know,” said the musician Anjos.

Perhaps the most foreboding warning came from Cooper Turley: “I see this as incredibly risky – f**king mad risky,” he said.

And while the early returns were perhaps great, the cryptocurrency market is entering an uncertain fourth quarter.

Farmer beware.

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

The University of Cambridge has published its 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study. The report analyzes data from the cryptocurrency exchange, payments, custody and mining sectors. Among its many findings, the report notes that the cryptocurrency industry “has entered a growth stage despite the notable headwinds” and cites improved regulatory clarity as having assisted in this growth. The report highlights regulatory compliance, IT security and insurance as areas that pose “hurdles” to continued growth.

Late last week, the Central Bank of The Bahamas announced that beginning on Oct. 20 it will “gradually release a digital version of the Bahamian dollar nationally … through authorised financial institutions.” According to a press release, the Bahamian central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be named the “sand dollar” and the first phase of its rollout will involve “low value personal wallets … with more restricted transaction limits … regular personal accounts in line with … existing banking and financial services” and “business or enterprise accounts, subject to further KYC rigour and with higher limits.”

This week, major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced “shielded Zcash (ZEC) withdrawals.” According to a blog post, the new service will allow “confidential, encrypted withdrawals” of ZEC that give users “control of your privacy.” The blog post notes that “with the right controls in place and the proper education, regulators can get comfortable with privacy-enabling cryptos.”

Ethereum Enterprise Solutions Announced, US Air Force Expands Blockchain Initiative

By: Jordan R. Silversmith

Earlier this week, a major Big Four professional services firm issued two press releases about new blockchain solutions under development. The first relates to a blockchain-based procurement solution on its proprietary platform that allows companies to run private, secure end-to-end procurement activities on the public Ethereum blockchain. The second announcement relates to the beta launch of a new “Explorer & Visualizer” that will allow users to track and analyze in-depth patterns and trends for data stored on a blockchain. According to the press release, the solution will make it possible for internal audit teams and forensic accountants to search for specific transactions, addresses and blocks to gather relevant information to support the management of legal, compliance and fraud risks, among others.

A recent report by Dutch academics discussing the use of blockchain technology to improve organic or fair trade food traceability under EU regulations found that organic food supply companies using blockchain to improve traceability face two key decisions: optimizing chain partner collaboration and choosing which data to capture in the blockchain. The authors noted that one practical implication of their findings is that blockchain is already being used successfully on a small scale to create whole-chain traceability of organic and fair trade food in Europe.

This week, a blockchain-based data management startup announced it had raised additional funding of $2.5 million from venture capital backers to further develop a distributed data management platform for the U.S. Air Force. The new capital pushes the company’s total seed funding to $6.5 million and also unlocks a $1.5 million defense contract pledged as matching funds through the Air Force’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. A spokesman for the company said that they will use the funds to hire more engineers to work on its verifiable credential and distributed identity infrastructures.

SEC Approves Digital Asset Settlement Process, Crypto Brokerage Registers in Canada

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

On Sept. 25, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regarding the role of alternative trading systems (ATS) in the settlement of digital asset security trades. The SEC letter was in response to questions from FINRA about the application of the SEC and FINRA’s previously published Joint Staff Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities. According to the letter, “since the issuance of the Joint Staff Statement, several broker-dealers seeking to operate an ATS that trades digital asset securities” have expressed a preference for a certain process for settling ATS trades – termed the “Three-Step Process” – that was not specifically addressed by the Joint Staff Statement. The SEC letter describes the Three-Step Process for ATS trade settlement and confirms that SEC staff will not recommend enforcement action if “a broker-dealer operating an ATS that trades digital asset securities uses the Three-Step Process.”

According to a press release this week, Netcoins, a Canadian “cryptocurrency brokerage,” announced that it has “applied for registration from the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) and the Canadian Securities Administrators’ (CSA) regulatory sandbox.” The press release notes that, if approved, Netcoins will become “the first regulated open-loop crypto asset trading platform in Canada.”

Court Rules in Favor of SEC in Kik Case, SEC Settles with Two More ICO Issuers

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

This week the Court in the closely watched case SEC v. Kik Interactive Inc. ruled in favor of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on cross motions for summary judgment related to the SEC’s enforcement action against Kik. The Court agreed with the SEC and found that Kik’s $100 million initial coin offering (ICO) was an unregistered public offering of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The decision creates significant precedent on the application of the Howey test, which interprets the term “investment contract” under Section 5 of the Securities Act, to fundraising events commonly known in the blockchain industry as ICOs.

The SEC has recently taken action against two more ICO issuers. In a cease-and-desist order and related settlement, the SEC settled charges of fraud and securities laws violation against SoluTech, alleging its 2018 ICO, which “raised approximately $2.4 million from more than 100 investors, including U.S. residents” was a public sale of unregistered securities. Among other things, as part of the settlement, SoluTech agreed to remove its token, SCRL, from trading on digital asset trading platforms; destroy all SCRL in its custody; and take certain steps to demonstrate its compliance with the settlement terms. The owner of SoluTech agreed to a civil penalty of $25,000 and to a ban on participating in future offerings of digital assets.

In a similar action, the SEC imposed a cease-and-desist order and entered into a related settlement with Salt Blockchain Inc. related to its 2017 ICO, which raised approximately $47 million. The SEC found that the Salt Tokens sold in the ICO were securities and the ICO was an unregistered securities offering in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. Among other things, Salt Blockchain Inc. agreed to register its Salt Tokens as securities; initiate a process for refunding Salt Token purchasers, including reporting to the SEC; and pay a civil penalty of $250,000.

Singapore Exchange Hacked, French Arrest 29 in Crypto Terrorist Financing Scheme

By: Joanna F. Wasick

Late last week, a major Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange reported large, unauthorized withdrawals of cryptocurrencies from certain exchange hot wallets to an unknown wallet beginning on Sept. 26. According to reports, the stolen funds, with an estimated value of more than $150 million, appear to be moving to decentralized exchanges. According to the exchange, the hack is being investigated by international law enforcement and the stolen money will be covered by an insurance fund.

Earlier this week, French police arrested 29 individuals for operating a cryptocurrency scheme to finance Islamist extremists in Syria. According to reports, the terrorist financing ring, reportedly active since 2019, would purchase cryptocurrency “coupons” in France and send those details by secure messaging to Syrian jihadists, who converted them into actual cryptocurrency, which was then sold for cash. Hundreds of thousands of euros are thought to have been supplied through the network, which reportedly benefited members of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.

A leading blockchain analytics and forensics company recently issued its 2020 risk report on the know-your-customer (KYC) protocols of more than 800 virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in more than 80 countries. The report finds that, despite existing, cryptocurrency-related AML government regulations, 56 percent of VASPs have “weak or porous” KYC processes, allowing those VASPs to be used to facilitate money laundering. According to the report, the U.S., Singapore and the U.K. host the highest number of VASPs with poor KYC protocols – although the report acknowledges that this is largely due to those countries having a higher number of VASPs in general. On average, by country, the report gives its lowest VASP KYC marks to Russia and a number of other countries in Europe.

The FCA said these products are “ill-suited” for retail consumers due to various reasons, including “extreme volatility” of cryptocurrencies. There is no legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products, said the regulator. Hacks, inadequate understanding, and cryptocurrencies’ “no reliable basis for valuation” are some other listed reasons for the ban.

“This ban reflects how seriously we view the potential harm to retail consumers in these products,"" said Sheldon Mills, interim executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""Consumer protection is paramount here.""

The ban will come into effect on January 6, 2021. The FCA estimates that retail consumers will save around £53 million (~$68 million) from the ban on these products.

The FCA's action will not only impact crypto derivative exchanges, but also crypto brokers, investment platforms, and financial advisers.

""If your firm carries out marketing, distribution or selling activities in, or from, the UK of the relevant products to retail clients, you are required to cease these activities by 6 January 2021,"" said the FCA in a separate policy statement. ""Retail consumers with existing holdings can remain invested following the prohibition, until they choose to disinvest. There is no time limit on this, and we do not require or expect firms to close out retail consumers’ positions unless consumers ask for this.""



'Extremely disappointed'

""We are extremely disappointed by the FCA's decision to include delta 1 exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in its ban on distribution of crypto derivatives to retail investors in the U.K.,"" Townsend Lansing, head of product at CoinShares, told The Block. ""We (and many other industry participants) put forward a number of reasons why such a ban would be ill-advised and would not benefit retail investors. Unfortunately, the FCA ignored those reasons (or dismissed them with little additional information).""

Lansing said the ban on these ETNs would not result in the proposed savings and benefits. ""Rather, it will simply drive U.K. retail investors to unregulated crypto exchanges, which, as the FCA itself admits, have far fewer protections than the regulated ETNs offered by CoinShares and other providers.""

According to Lansing, the timing of the ban is also ""unfortunate."" He said other jurisdictions are now opening up to the crypto sector, such as the European Commission recently proposed regulatory regime for digital assets. ""We find it difficult to see how the U.K. can be seen as welcoming of digital asset innovation when it is the only Western jurisdiction to ban them based on an erroneous belief that they have 'no intrinsic value,'"" said Lansing.

Danny Scott, co-founder and CEO of U.K.-based crypto exchange CoinCorner told The Block that the ban doesn't affect ""bitcoin exchanges like ourselves, but it will affect companies such as Revolut and eToro that offer a CFD [contract for differences] rather than the asset itself.""



A Revolut spokesperson told The Block that the ban does not impact the firm as it does not offer CFDs/derivatives or ETNs. ""Our customers own the crypto and we buy on their behalf,"" the spokesperson said.

(Kitco News) The price trajectory for bitcoin is up, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which sees the popular cryptocurrency adding another zero to its price tag and trading at $100,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin has had an impressive growth cycle in the last ten years, rising from $10 in 2011 to $1,000 in 2013 and to $10,000 in 2017. And even though Bloomberg Intelligence foresees a slightly slower growth path going forward, it does not rule out a $100,000 price tag in 2025.

At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $10,582, down 2.08% on the day.

""Bitcoin could continue doing what it has for most of its nascent existence, appreciating in price on the back of increasing adoption, but at a slower pace as we see it. The first-born crypto has had a tendency to add zeros to its price from around $10 in 2011. It took about four years to go from $1,000 to $10,000 in 2017, so doubling that time frame for maturation could get the price toward $100,000 in about five more years,"" wrote Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone.

The driver behind this rally will be wider adoption, McGlone added while pointing to historical price charts for an explanation.

""Bitcoin is unique in that supply cannot be influenced by price, leaving adoption as a primary valuation metric,"" he said in the October update. ""Since initially reaching $10,000 in 2017, the benchmark crypto corrected about 70% and remains in an extended period of consolidation around that level. When Bitcoin first traded at $1,000 in 2013, it corrected about 80% and consolidated. About four years after initially reaching $1,000, it added a zero … Bitcoin has a history of adding zeros.""

The demand fundamentals are looking positive for the cryptocurrency with expectations that new adoption measures will continue to boost prices higher. Also, bitcoin's growing market cap will act as a demand accelerator for adopting the cryptocurrency, creating a path for higher prices.

""The total value of gold is around $9 trillion vs. only about $190 billion for Bitcoin. For comparison, the benchmark crypto is about half the market cap of Tesla. A big difference is higher prices are increasing the supply of Tesla stock. Bitcoin supply is fixed and declining on an annual percentage basis,"" explained McGlone. ""At less than $200 billion, the Bitcoin market is too small for many large institutions, including central banks, to add the crypto as part of their holdings, but if the market cap of Bitcoin increases, it becomes increasingly like a digital version of gold.""

Investors could see bitcoin rise to $14,000 before the end of this year, added McGlone.

Bitcoin is 'becoming more like gold'

Bitcoin is becoming more like gold, and this year points to an interesting correlation, noted McGlone.

""Bitcoin, like gold, is in transition to being a beneficiary of increasing stock market volatility, in our view,"" he said. ""Our chart depicts the highest Bitcoin-to-gold 12-month correlation in our database since 2010. The crypto 12-month measure vs. the S&P 500 is elevated, but has been higher.""

Gold and bitcoin have been gaining alongside each other this year and are likely to continue to do so as the stock market slows down, the October update added.

""The dichotomy of an unchanged U.S. stock market in 2020 nearing the end of 3Q vs. the advancing prices of gold and Bitcoin is a shift toward relative value that we see gaining endurance,"" McGlone said. ""If the rapidly advancing stock market of the past decade has run its course … more quantitative easing and rising debt-to-GDP levels are likely, supporting the stores of value.""",2020-10-06 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/john-mcafee-arrested-23-million-crypto-pumping/,"John McAfee Arrested, Indicted for $23 Million Illegal Crypto Pumping and Tax Evasion in US

John McAfee has been arrested and indicted for tax evasion, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. The cybersecurity entrepreneur has also been charged with fraudulently pumping cryptocurrencies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

McAfee Fraudulently Pumped Tokens

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) independently announced their actions against two-time U.S. presidential candidate John McAfee on Monday.

The SEC has charged the 74-year-old antivirus software tycoon and his bodyguard Jimmy Watson Jr. with fraudulently pumping initial coin offerings (ICOs). The agency explained that from at least November 2017 to February 2018, “McAfee leveraged his fame to make more than $23.1 million U.S. dollars (‘USD’) in undisclosed compensation by recommending at least seven ‘initial coin offerings’ or ICOs to his Twitter followers.” He had approximately 784,000 Twitter followers at the time; that number has significantly grown to about a million at press time.

According to the SEC, the antivirus software pioneer did not disclose that he was being paid to promote the tokens, which constitutes “unlawful ‘touting’ and violates the federal securities laws.” Emphasizing that “The ICOs at issue involved the offer and sale of digital asset securities and McAfee’s recommendations were materially false and misleading for several reasons,” the SEC detailed:

The ICOs McAfee touted raised at least approximately $41 million and McAfee made approximately $23.2 million in secret compensation for his touts.

The SEC also noted that McAfee “lied to investors by falsely denying he was being paid by the issuers” when directly asked if he was being paid to promote the coins.

His paid promotions were exposed by a blogger in February 2018, rendering his tweets useless for pumping more ICOs. However, he still held “a large number of virtually worthless securities from the ICOs he had previously touted,” the SEC continued, adding that he then paid a third party to pump these tokens and encouraged investors to buy them without disclosing that he was trying to dump his own stash.

“McAfee engaged in a practice known as ‘scalping,'” which “generally allows promoters to sell their securities holdings quickly and profitably through market interest that they deceptively generate, and violates the federal securities laws,” the SEC described.

Watson was McAfee’s bodyguard, who “substantially assisted McAfee’s touting and scalping schemes,” the SEC alleges, adding:

McAfee was paid bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) worth more than $11.6 million, plus an additional $11.5 million worth of promoted tokens, as undisclosed compensation for his promotions of seven ICOs. McAfee paid Watson at least $316,000 for his role.

The SEC seeks to order the defendants “to disgorge all ill-gotten gains” and “pay civil monetary penalties.” The agency also seeks to permanently prohibit McAfee from serving as an officer or director of certain companies and the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any digital asset security.

McAfee has been aware of the SEC watching him for quite some time. In December 2018, he tweeted: “Folks are warning me against opposing the SEC and point to Elon Musk’s submission to them as an example I should follow. I have had many dances with the SEC. I know who they are, and I am not Elon Musk – I’m John Fucking McAfee. Watch the difference.”

McAfee Arrested and Indicted for Tax Evasion

Meanwhile, the DOJ unsealed an indictment Monday charging McAfee “with tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns.” According to the announcement, “The June 15, 2020 indictment was unsealed following McAfee’s arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition.” On Sept. 28, the two-time presidential candidate tweeted that he “Went to Spain this weekend to check the progress of the Mud Wrestling Arena I’m building.”

The DOJ explained that McAfee failed to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018 despite receiving “millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.”

“McAfee allegedly evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees,” the announcement notes. “The indictment further alleges McAfee attempted to evade the IRS by concealing assets, including real property, a vehicle, and a yacht, in the names of others.” Besides facing “a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties,” the DOJ explained:

If convicted, McAfee faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum sentence of one year in prison on each count of willful failure to file a tax return.

McAfee has made no secret of the fact that he is not paying taxes. “Tax evasion is [a] misrepresentation of income. I have never done that. I merely refuse to pay,” he tweeted in February. Moreover, news.Bitcoin.com reported in January 2019 that McAfee had fled the U.S. and was living in exile on a boat after he was charged with “using cryptocurrencies in criminal acts.”

Making consensus

Scaling for censorship-resistance

The shakedown of bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX last week is a healthy reminder of what motivates many DeFi developers: building censorship-resistant financial markets.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The meaningful comparison between BitMEX and decentralized finance, of course, is the self-executing nature of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain. Through bits and bytes, developers are working toward a future where U.S. regulators cannot take down financial markets – let alone any application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

Still, while theoretically capable of supporting a new world of censorship-resistant finance, the Ethereum blockchain has hit the hard limits of its own infrastructure.

Ethereum isn’t ready for prime time performance. Its mainchain and many decentralized applications (dapp) can barely handle the economic strain users have put it under this summer, which saw fees shoot to record highs twice.

One of the most urgent and interesting questions in crypto is how to create a censorship-resistant economy that actually works. While there are no easy solutions to rising gas fees, it’s a topic drawing some of the most creative minds, all with their own ideas.

On Oct. 14, MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen and Near Protocol’s Illia Polosukhin will discuss the issue of gas fees at invest: ethereum economy. Others will focus on the future of Ethereum, and the long road it has taken towards scalability with Ethereum 2.0. While under development for years, this updated chain remains a gamble.

For instance, Phase 1.5 and Phase 2 – the latter stages of Eth 2.0 that should theoretically push the blockchain to tens of thousands of transactions per second – have not been fully scoped out. Some aspects remain completely unknown. (Perhaps as it should be, given the fast pace of discovery in crypto land.)

But phase 0 is nearly upon us. Multiple testnets have led developers and stakers to the autumn’s main event: the release of a deposit contract for stakers expected this month. Once enough ether (ETH) is deposited in the contract, the new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain can begin to turn along.

Called the Beacon chain, the PoS blockchain will act as a spinal cord of sorts for Eth 2.0’s multi-blockchain settlement scheme. For now, the Beacon chain stands as a symbol of a censorship resistant future. A promise of technology, but one under development.

It’s a topic Vitalik Buterin will likely go into during his keynote speech at Invest. Others, like Alchemy’s Michael Garland and Anchorage’s Diogo Mónica, will go further into the weeds, discussing not only the mechanics behind this multi-year blockchain swap but also why it matters for people’s bottom line during “ETH Staking: The Service You’ll Want to Buy.”

Join us for a day-long exploration of the ins and outs of the go-to platform for decentralized applications, its current setup and future roadmap.

Featured panel

Stake it or farm it?

Ethereum has introduced new ways for people to get their money to work for them. Whether it’s securing or participating in a network or creating other interest from your money, new rewards and incentives abound for those willing to engage. In a panel discussion, titled “Making Your Money Work for You,” Gauntlet’s Tarun Chitra, Stake’s Tim Ogilvie and Balancer Lab’s Fernando Martinelli will discuss how to manage risks, optimize rewards and build a portfolio using ether-based assets.

Tune in from 10:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m. ET, Oct. 14.

Ethereum 101

Ethereum 2.0 represents the first time the cryptocurrency industry will see a blockchain of its size and value attempt to transition all users, as well as assets, to an entirely new decentralized network while keeping all operations on the old network active and running.

So what will happen to your ether and non-fungible tokens (NFT) once Ethereum 2.0 goes live? CoinDesk research analyst Christine Kim explains.

Ethereum 2.0 is coming

The years-long upgrade – intended to radically transform the world’s largest smart-contract platform – is inching closer to deployment.

As of July 10, some developers, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, estimate the oft-delayed Eth 2.0 will launch by the end of this year.

When phase zero of Eth 2.0 does ship, little about Ethereum will change in the near term for users and dapp developers. This is because unlike all other system-wide upgrades in Ethereum history, the Eth 2.0 overhaul will primarily be happening on a different blockchain.

The first phase of development for Eth 2.0 is centered around the creation of a separate proof-of-stake blockchain network called the beacon chain. On this new network, ETH holders with a minimum of 32 ETH can earn rewards in the form of annualized interest on their wealth. To earn these rewards, ETH holders must have the appropriate hardware and software connecting to the beacon chain and a strong understanding of how the technology works.

Ethereum as we know it today will eventually be folded into the Eth 2.0 upgrade in its entirety. The report features commentary from Ethereum developers about what benefits – but also risks – this may bring.

The culmination of over five years of research and development, Ethereum 2.0 is a highly ambitious upgrade.

For an even deeper dive, CoinDesk Research published a 22-page report on “Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters.”

At stake

Osho Jha is an investor, data scientist and tech company executive who enjoys finding and analyzing unique data sets for investing in both public and private markets.

In this essay, published in early 2020, Jha details why the transition to a Proof-of-Stake chain will turn Ethereum into a functioning store of value.

Store of value

Before diving into the impact that staking could have on ether (ETH), it is important to understand how the ETH “money supply” currently works. As we know, bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed supply of 21 million coins and the rate at which these coins are released into the money supply decreases over time. ETH does not have a fixed supply but, like BTC, it has a declining inflation rate.

There is a fixed issuance of new ETH annually. As the money supply grows, that fixed issuance becomes a smaller portion of the total money supply. As with BTC halvings, ETH over time has reduced the block reward for miners. The transition to Ethereum 2.0’s staking mechanism is set to reduce the inflation rate of ETH to 0.5%-2.0%, putting it in the same company as BTC and gold in terms of supply inflation.

I look at ETH as the fiat to BTC’s gold. Despite negative connotations in the crypto community, fiat currencies aren’t inherently bad and the main advantage of an unfixed total supply is flexibility to adjust supply during different economic climates. Central banks have taken this flexibility to an extreme in recent years, and, while ETH’s supply is not fixed, its projected long term inflation may be a happy middle ground between fixed supply and unbridled money printing.

Demand-side dynamics

In many ways, ETH trades like a venture investment. Investors believe Ethereum will be the underlying technology for the future of decentralized apps and they buy ETH in the same way they would shares [of stock]. I find this troubling because, by its very nature, ETH is not a stock and these investors are taking on a bigger risk than they might think.

Staking is the key to making ETH function as a value store. At its core, staking incentivizes holding ETH in a node that can then be used by the network to verify transactions. The greater the number of nodes, the faster the network can function and the more secure it becomes. Staking is not new. Projects ranging from Hedera Hashgraph to Facebook Libra have some sort of staking mechanism built in. But they don’t have the advantage of being the de facto network decentralized app developers lean on.

For investors, there are incentives to staking tokens in a node, including rewards similar to earning interest on a bank deposit. While the staking rewards vary based on network performance and utilization, target returns are close to 10% annually. Though actual returns will vary as the network gets up and running, the possibility of earning returns on coins that would otherwise be in a wallet should entice ETH holders to stake.

In a global low-rate environment, these returns are certainly attractive. And staking may be the killer app that allows ETH to become a “positive carry asset.” In other words, it generates a positive return for holding it as opposed to, say, gold, which is negative-carry, as it incurs storage costs. Long term, positive carry stimulates demand and creates an incentive to borrow cash to purchase and earn yield. Overall, positive-carry assets increase stability of price movements by creating long term holders and widening the investor base.

Investors are becoming aware of this dynamic. To stake a node, there is a minimum required 32 ETH (thought staking pools can allow staking to be done with as little as 1 ETH).

ETH as a store of value

Current events have forced us to adapt to a more digital life and also shown us the limitation of legacy banking systems. Even the distribution of stimulus checks became a nontrivial problem. With the market focused on bitcoin and its role in unstable economic times, the advances being set forth by Ethereum 2.0 have been largely overlooked. However, Ethereum 2.0 lays out a platform which can help create better digital experiences and ease the friction as individuals and institutions transition to a digital-first world.

As we mentioned earlier, staking will turn ETH into a positive carry asset, which in turn brings price stability and broadens the investor base. By staking accumulated tokens, investors will both earn yield and help scale the network in a secure way.

While ETH is being staked, there is demand for stablecoins and banking-esque services, which are being deployed and iterated on in the DeFi space as a whole. With this dynamic, transactions can be made using stablecoins while ETH itself is staked to generate interest income. This may sound foreign and futuristic but it’s not much different than when people keep savings in an interest-generating savings accounts, or investments, and keep day-to-day money in a checking account.

The ledger

Going back to Will Foxley’s introduction, Ethereum 2.0 promises to revolutionize finance and the crypto economy, but there are still a lot of open questions. Last year, my former colleague Leigh Cuen wrote an article examining many of the most contentious issues surrounding the development and eventual deployment of Eth 2.0. During the largest blockchain overhaul to date, many of the nuances being discussed are reduced to simple gut reactions: is what’s happening a “scam” or an iteration.

Iterative processes

For Ethereum’s critics in the Bitcoin community, [September 2019] brought a “gotcha” moment.

Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, acknowledged onstage at Ethereal Tel Aviv that the network, in its original form, wasn’t built for mass adoption. “We knew it wasn’t going to be scalable for sure,” the ConsenSys CEO said.

Predictable cries of “scam” from ardent bitcoiners followed. But Lubin’s statement wasn’t scandalous in the least to the Ethereum fans at Devcon – the community’s largest and most influential annual gathering – where roughly 3,000 attendees gathered this week in Osaka, Japan.

Even those who knew the first version wasn’t scalable don’t see early marketing claims as misleading. They see iteration as an inherent process.

“Bitcoiners are kinda like hardcore fascist Catholics that just think everything else is wrong,” Dean Eigenmann, a researcher at the Ethereum startup Status, said [in 2019]. “I think [Ethereum] underdelivered on its promises, but it has delivered.”

The sanguine vibe at Devcon highlights the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, which has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with: Bitcoin is an individualistic monetary asset while Ethereum, convoluted as its path to mass adoption may be, is a communal promise to continue experimenting with smart contracts, together.

James Prestwich, one of the leaders of a project aiming to create cross-chain capital flows between Bitcoin and Ethereum, said at the time he believes all cryptocurrency narratives evolve. So even if a blockchain manifests something different than the original white paper, that doesn’t make it a scam.

So what have the Ethereum founders delivered since they sold more than 7 million tokens to retail investors to kickstart the network in 2014?

The original Ethereum platform inspired billions of dollars worth of economic activity, from token sales to DeFi loans, and influenced the way regulators view cryptocurrencies that “decentralize” after fundraising.

But the jury is still out as to whether that accrued value will translate to the next version of the smart contract platform.

‘Lack of strategy’

Devcon attendees weren’t shy in discussing the road ahead, or who will fund this work.

According to Peter Mauric, Ethereum client Parity’s head of communications, the bulk of Ethereum-related funding programs will now prioritize creating a new blockchain, Eth 2. Sources with knowledge of such development plans estimated it would take at least two years to build this next version of Ethereum.

“No one really knows what Eth 1 will look like once Eth 2 exists,” Mauric said at the time. “There’s not a ton of new development going on in the current chain clients. Most of the ongoing work is maintenance.”

There’s no clear plan for how to migrate hundreds of Ethereum-based tokens and smart contracts, including DeFi projects, to the new chain in the foreseeable future, according to Buterin, Prestwich and Mike Porcaro, head of communications at the MakerDAO Foundation.

Developer Jamie Pitts, contracted by the Ethereum Foundation, kicked off the opening ceremony on Tuesday by sharing his concerns.

“I feel like there’s a lack of strategy,” Pitts said. “I think there’s a lot of teams working on their ideas, but there’s a lack of coordination.”

According to James Beck, communications lead at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based venture studio helmed by Lubin, there were in 2019 nine teams working on clients for the upcoming Eth 2 blockchain, including Prysmatic Labs, Chainsafe, Status and the ConsenSys-owned startup PegaSys.

However, according to several sources with knowledge of Ethereum infrastructure projects, the bulk of funds for Eth 1 and Eth 2 development still comes from either the Ethereum Foundation or ConsenSys, in addition to smaller funding mechanisms like the MolochDAO and the Meta Cartel, both of which also accept public donations. Pitts told CoinDesk this doesn’t concern him because these funders don’t control development choices.

While there are still many unanswered questions about how the project will diversify beyond reliance on funding from its founders, Josh Cincinnati, director of the Zcash Foundation, said Ethereum has achieved a significant level of decentralized participation from the bottom-up.

“Something Ethereum has proven to be really good at is making exotic financial contracts approachable for developers,” Cincinnati said.

Vitalik’s view

From Buterin’s perspective, Eth 1 was a successful experiment that paved the way for Eth 2, which will require a focus on incentives, through Proof-of-Stake, before live transactions.

“I’d argue it has done a lot of good. The ICO boom has pretty much single-handedly funded research into all of these general cryptography things,” Buterin told CoinDesk.

As for layer-two solutions, which allow a high number of transactions to take place off-chain and reserve the ethereum ledger for final settlement, Buterin said some are proceeding “slower than expected. Raiden hasn’t gotten too far too fast and Plasma hasn’t gotten too far too fast. But people are still iterating and working on that.”

Buterin also mentioned pressure from businesspeople who discouraged him from speaking openly about these scaling challenges, which, as noted, many felt were obvious.

“You’re not supposed to say your own platform has limitations,” Buterin said.

McAfee arrested

John McAfee, the 74-year-old software magnate turned crypto bull, was reportedly arrested in Spain on allegations of tax evasion, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. His extradition to the U.S. is pending. The announcement comes the same day the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued McAfee for allegedly pumping initial coin offerings (ICOs) without disclosing he was being paid to do so. McAfee is said to have received BTC and ETH worth more than $11.6 million for promoting seven ICOs in 2017 and 2018. He also allegedly received $11.5 million in the promoted tokens. The SEC does not name the projects in the suit.

Crypto crackdown

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published final rules banning the sale of derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that reference certain types of crypto assets to retail consumers. The U.K. financial regulator said it considers these products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. Specifically, the ban will affect “the sale, marketing and distribution” to retail investors of any derivatives contract or ETNs that are linked to “unregulated transferable crypto assets” issued by entities in or outside the U.K. The U.K. ban will come into effect on Jan. 6, 2021. Some U.K.-based crypto firms plan to dispute the ruling.

Buck up

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the greenback as a global reserve currency any time soon, according to one of the most highly regarded analysts in foreign exchange. “Backing the dollar is the world’s biggest, deepest and the most transparent government bond market,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of the book “Making Sense of the Dollar,” told CoinDesk in a recent video chat. “I just don’t know how bitcoin can replace the greenback from that viewpoint.” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports, before bitcoin can threaten the dollar’s hegemony, the crypto community’s focus needs to shift from playing for price rallies to building infrastructure that would accelerate adoption at the institutional level.

Ripple suit

Ripple was only partially successful in its bid to have a class-action lawsuit over alleged securities fraud thrown out. In a court ruling filed last Friday, District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted with prejudice two parts of Ripple’s motion to dismiss the 10 claims against it and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The accusations come as a consolidated action from a group of disgruntled investors who claim Ripple and Garlinghouse failed to register XRP as a security and made misleading statements about the cryptocurrency. Judge Hamilton ruled that some of the plaintiff’s claims were unsupported, though the case was not dismissed.

Going dark

Popular privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency wallets and other technologies were named as “top threats” in Europol’s 2020 Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment published Monday. According to a report by the European Union’s law enforcement agency, “privacy-enhanced wallet services using coinjoin concepts (for example, Wasabi and Samurai [sic] wallets) have emerged as a top threat in addition to well established centralized mixers.” And, “Criminals have started to use other privacy-focused, decentralized marketplace platforms, such as OpenBazaar and Particl.io to sell their illegal goods,” the report says. According to the report, bitcoin remains the top currency on the darkweb, though privacy coins are seeing increased use.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-10-06 16:19:32+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cryptocurrency-wallet-brd-reaches-6-million-users-driven-by-growth-in-latin-america-and-india/,"Mobile cryptocurrency wallet BRD announced today that it now has more than six million users worldwide, thanks to strong growth in India and Latin America. With this momentum, the company expects to reach 10 million users by early 2021.

Founded in 2015, Zurich-based BRD also said it now adds about one million new users every two months, after initially taking more than four years to hit the one million user mark. It reached 550,000 monthly active users at the beginning of July. Co-founder and chief executive officer Adam Traidman attributes the increased interest in cryptocurrency, especially among first-time users, to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It’s causing a lot of people who are staying at home and sheltering in place to reconsider a lot of fundamental questions about their life and family right now,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s causing a lot of thinking about money and finances. People have had a lot more time over the last six months to look at their investments and as a result of that, we found that for cryptocurrency in general, but especially for BRD’s business, we’ve been growing dramatically.”

He added that BRD, which has raised $55 million in funding from investors like SBI Crypto Investment and East Ventures, has two main groups of users. The first are millennials who have discretionary income that they invest using apps like Robinhood instead of traditional brokerages. The second group are people who have been more financially impacted by the pandemic and are turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to cope with currency fluctuations in their countries or as a more cost-effective alternative to international wire transfers to send money to family members. Falling bank interest rates have also prompted many people to consider alternative places to put their money.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the most popular purchases through BRD, in countries with volatile currency fluctuations, like Venezuela, Argentina and India, interest in stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar, is growing. The company is also seeing more adoption in Eastern European countries.

BRD is a non-custodial wallet and cryptocurrencies are stored on users’ devices, which makes it more accessible to users in countries who need to undergo lengthy registration processes to use custodial wallets. The app also allows people to use Apple Pay or their bank cards to buy cryptocurrency. This ease of use is one of the reasons for its growth, Traidman said.

The company’s most recent funding announcement was a $15 million Series B announced in January 2019 for expansion in Asian markets. BRD also offers enterprise blockchain tools called Blockset and says it is currently used to store the equivalent of about $6 billion in cryptocurrencies.",2020-10-06 00:00:00,https://www.cityam.com/bitmex-owners-charged-for-illegally-operating-crypto-exchange-as-defi-keeps-rising/,"This week CryptoCompare data shows the price of Bitcoin (BTC) moved steadily up from around $10,200 to an $11,000 high, but did not break through and ended up correcting back down to $10,500. It has since moved back up to $10,650.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, started the week around $360 and moved up to $390, but as soon as the price of BTC started dropping ETH dropped to $325, before recovering. CryptoCompare data shows it’s now trading at $350.

This week the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have filed charges against the owners of the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX for allegedly executing futures transactions on an illegal platform, offering illegal options, failing to implement proper know-your-customer (KYC) checks, failing to implement anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, and more.

BitMEX’s co-founder, Arthur Hayes, Ben Delo, Samuel Reed, and the exchange’s first employee Gregory Dwyer were charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiracy to violate the act. The Department of Justice’s press release revealed Reed has already been arrested, while the other three remain at large.

According to the Wall Street Journal, BitMEX’s lawyers plan on fighting the allegations. Peter Altman and Jim Benjamin of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, attorneys of Arthur Hayes, said he worked hard to build BitMEX, and added:

From its early days as a start-up, the company sought to comply with applicable U.S. laws, as those laws were understood at the time and based on available guidance.

Johnny Lyu, the CEO of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, which last week suffered a major security breach that saw hackers steal over $280 million worth of BTC, ETH, BSV, LTC, USDT, and various ERC-20 tokens, has announced the exchange found the suspects behind the security breach and has “substantial proof at hand.”

A quick update since my last livestream on Sep 30.



After a thorough investigation, we have found the suspects of the 9.26 #KuCoin Security Incident with substantial proof at hand. Law enforcement officials and police are officially involved to take action. — lyu_johnny (@lyu_johnny) October 3, 2020

In a follow-up, Lyu added that with supports from industry partners “ another $64 million in assets are now out of the control of the suspicious addresses,” implying the cryptocurrency exchange has slowly been recovering stolen funds while coordinating with other exchanges – likely those the hacker tried to use to launder funds.

The CEO added the cryptocurrency exchange is “coming back to full functionality,” pointing out deposits and withdrawals are now open for some tokens.

Despite the KuCoin hack and BitMEX being charged by the CFTC and DOJ, a report published by derivatives trading platform ZUBR revealed that institutional investors are betting on bitcoin’s long-term performance, and shifting towards physically-delivered futures over cash-settled ones.

The report indicated that open interest on the CME and other regulated crypto derivatives trading platforms has “remained consistently higher in comparison to their traded volumes,” indicating institutional investors are looking at BTC in the long-term. The report added that over time investors have been moving towards physically-delivered BTC contracts.

Uniswap becomes first DeFi protocol with over $2 billion locked in it

The decentralized cryptocurrency trading platform Uniswap has become the first decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency locked in it, as investors have been moving funds to it in a bid to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings while earning the platform’s UNI governance token.

On Uniswap, users can provide liquidity to specific trading pairs, and are rewarded with a 0.3% fee paid by traders on the exchange for doing so. Interacting with the protocol also entitles them to rewards in the UNI token. This led to rise in total value locked on Uniswap, which now stands above $2.3 billion.

Uniswap grew so fast that the 24-hour trading volume on it surpassed that of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

🤯 Wow, @UniswapProtocol 24hr trading volume is higher than @coinbase for the first time ever

The growth of the decentralized finance space and its protocols – including Uniswap, Maker, AAve, and Curve – has seen Ethereum’s cumulative transaction fees so far this year cross the $350 million market, more than double the aggregated total of the fees paid to move funds on the Bitcoin blockchain.

DeFi has reportedly contributed to a dramatic rise in transaction fees as users “compete to be first in line for a trade” on protocols like Uniswap. Ethereum’s median transaction fee hit a new all-time high earlier this month of $8.25, after SushiSwap’s SUSHI token was launched. SushiSwpa, it’s worth noting, is a fork of Uniswap.

The popularity of DeFi protocols has also led to some losses. This week an unknown hacker has stolen over $15 million from an unreleased DeFi project called Eminence, created by Andre Cronje, the founder of Yearn.Finance, a popular DeFi project.

The exploit allowed the hacker to mint new tokens and steal funds in the process. Cronje is a controversial developer known for not using testnets, and the smart contracts for the project were still being developed.

An initiative by the Chamber of Digital Congress made $50 BTC contributions to all 535 members of Congress with bitcoin mined by U.S. operations.

This week, the Chamber of Digital Commerce PAC sent all 535 members of the United States Congress about 0.0047 BTC ($50 worth at the time), in an effort to educate the country’s legislators around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that it calls Crypto For Congress.

Leveraging Federal Election Commission rules that allow for cryptocurrency-based campaign contributions and its own Political Action Committee to make the BTC donations, the Chamber of Digital Commerce ultimately hopes to motivate these lawmakers to embrace the advantages presented by blockchain technology.

“Our industry faces a number of regulatory challenges and it’s important for our government officials to have a working knowledge of how this technology works,” Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, told Bitcoin Magazine. “If you look at tax laws, securities laws, if you look at compliance obligations, there are a lot of examples of regulators and policymakers who have tried to take this new asset class and shoehorn it into existing regulatory requirements… The more that people are informed and have a working knowledge of how this technology works, I think we’ll have a marketplace and regulatory environment that will promote innovation of blockchain technology in the U.S.”

Boring would not elaborate on how, technically, a Congressperson can accept their BTC donation, though she did say that the chamber is providing a comprehensive toolkit and instructions to walk them through it. She said that they can choose to accept the bitcoin as a one-time donation or enable their campaigns to accept ongoing cryptocurrency donations, they can choose to divert the donation to charity or they can outright refuse the donation.

American Made Bitcoin

There is a certain “American Made” angle to these donations as well. The BTC sent as part of the initiative came from a block mined by Core Scientific, which pointed hash rate from its mining facilities in Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina toward Luxor Technology mining pool software servers in Iowa. This simultaneously ensured that the bitcoin could not be traced to any unsavory activity, and showcased U.S.-based mining infrastructure.

“There’s obviously some concerns with giving them bitcoin from an exchange, unfortunately … there’s a risk that there’s some transaction history that’s potentially a bit sketchy for Congress,” Ethan Vera, the co-founder of Luxor Technologies, told Bitcoin Magazine. “We did give them clean coins, mined from Core Scientific’s facility in Kentucky, kind of ‘Made In America’ bitcoin for that reason… In an era where 98 percent of blocks are found by Chinese mining pools, it’s exciting to push back a bit and get some geographic distribution of where the blocks are actually being found.”

(Though there is nothing inherently centralized about Bitcoin mining, the majority of mining hash rate is produced in China or at least gathered by China-based bitcoin mining pools. But, because this geographic concentration could present potential risks to Bitcoin, there is an ongoing effort to decentralize mining. You can start to explore that Bitcoin Rabbit Hole with this recent article.)

Starting At The Beginning

Through “Crypto For Congress,” the Chamber of Digital Commerce is advocating for expanded use and adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology in general. As a free market advocate, the chamber does not officially favor one crypto project over another, but chose BTC for this initial donation for practical reasons.

“We felt it was important to start with the basics of simplicity,” Boring explained. “Bitcoin being the first cryptocurrency, the largest by market cap and the most well known, we felt that this was the best one to get started with.”

It stands to reason that a more pragmatic and better firsthand understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general will start with Bitcoin. While efforts like “Crypto For Congress” are still very much needed, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is optimistic that BTC-based campaign donations are improving this understanding among the nation’s lawmakers.

“We’re seeing more and more members of Congress accept bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies for their campaigns,” Boring said. “We see this as one small way that members of Congress can show that they understand this technology and promote it and support it… Where we’re helping to educate more people and more campaigns and more policymakers, we’re seeing a lot of support from the Washington community and that’s a big step forward that we’ve taken as an industry.”",2020-10-07 19:51:51+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-bitcoin-steady-trump-tweets-neo-ethereum,"Chinese tech companies were once seen as copycats of their Western peers: Alibaba was a knockoff of eBay and Baidu imitated Google. More recently, Chinese firms like TikTok and Huawei have established such dominant international positions that U.S. authorities have tried to hold them back.

Now, the technological arms race is playing out in the cryptocurrency industry, where one Chinese company is taking on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain, which U.S.-based developers have used to build semi-automated trading and lending networks under the rubric of decentralized finance, or DeFi.

Bitcoin defended the psychological support of $10,500 early Wednesday as Asian stocks shrugged off overnight weakness on Wall Street, reducing haven demand for the U.S. dollar.

European stocks, too, are trading higher at press time alongside gains in the S&P 500 futures.

Risk sentiment, which weakened Tuesday following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to abort the fiscal stimulus negotiations, was restored earlier today after he reversed course and urged Congress to approve a series of coronavirus relief measures, including a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks.

That said, a large-scale stimulus is unlikely to come through any time soon. As such, both bitcoin and stocks may have a tough time scoring significant gains.

Indeed, minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, due at 18:00 GMT, are expected to reiterate tolerance for high inflation. That dovish message, however, has already been priced in by markets.

For now, the cryptocurrency remains trapped in a narrowing price range. Contracting triangles usually end with violent moves on either side.

Growth in the new bitcoin addresses has recently picked up. According to blockchain analyst Cole Garner, that has bullish implications for price. However, according to Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium & EOSDT stablecoin, the address growth has been fueled, at least in part, by the recent mass exodus of bitcoins from controversial crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX to other major exchanges like Kraken, Binance, and Gemini.

Centralized stablecoins

Stablecoin use on DeFi applications has exploded in 2020.

Approximately $20 billion of crypto dollars are floating around, and a few billion of these have found their way into the ether by way of yield farming and lending. Even Ethereum’s flagship DeFi application, MakerDAO, is flooded with USDC, making the stablecoin the largest collateral for Maker’s DAI stablecoin.

That’s right, a stablecoin is the primary collateral for another stablecoin. That’s how deep crypto dollars go into DeFi’s liquidity. Outside of Maker, DAI, USDC, TUSD and USDT are the most popular pools on Aave, with a collective market size of $650 million. Uniswap has roughly $780 million in USDC, USDT and DAI staked in market pools. On Compound, DAI and USDC are the first and third most popular markets with a staggering $1.4 billion locked. As crypto dollars liquidity floods DeFi markets, will these tokens, which are centrally issued, threaten these application’s presumed decentralization? With bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX facing legal actions from U.S. regulators, questions have floated whether exchanges like Uniswap should worry about being targeted next.

Most DeFi proponents argue the “decentralized nature” of the exchange will excuse it from scrutiny. While the act of trading these assets may be considered decentralized, the assets themselves (namely, stablecoins) are not always decentralized. USDC, USDT, TUSD and PAX can be frozen and revoked by their central issuers.

If regulators wanted to come for DeFi, one weak point could be the stablecoin providers. This would even have implications for DAI, Ethereum’s so-called decentralized stablecoin, considering the bulk of its collateral comes from USDC.

Crypto dollars are obviously beneficial to DeFi’s market structure for the price stability they provide. This is largely why they have taken over as the dominant source of liquidity (even over ETH) in most markets.

But they are inherently centralized entities, and it remains to be seen how regulators are going to approach their use in DeFi lending and DeFi markets in general. This finally raises the question: Do stablecoins threaten DeFi’s perceived decentralization?

At CoinDesk’s virtual invest: ethereum economy program on Oct. 14, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Aave Finance founder Stani Kulechov will discuss how integral stablecoins have become for DeFi in their talk “Stablecoins, Hyper-Collateralization and the DeFi Economy.”

Looking beyond this question, stablecoin use in yield farming and elsewhere has contributed to Ethereum’s skyrocketing fees. MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen and Near protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin will discuss DeFi’s impact on Ethereum in their talk “The Fees are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum To its Limit.”

Weird DeFi

Ethereum’s highly anticipated 2.0 upgrade is poised to bring the network ever closer to fulfilling its original vision to be a “world computer” that plays host to a parallel, decentralized financial system.

At invest: ethereum economy on Oct. 14, we will address the ramifications for investors as decentralized finance takes the crypto world by storm.

In a run-up to the event, our two-part CoinDesk Live: Inside the Ethereum Economy virtual miniseries on Oct. 8 and Oct. 12 introduces trending narratives we will break down at the main event: Why all the hype behind yield farming and food-inspired tokens? Should investors take them seriously or are they a fading trend?

On Oct. 8, CoinDesk senior business reporter Brady Dale hosts Priyanka Desai of Open Law, Mason Nystrom of Messari and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX to assess the newest crazes sweeping the DeFi landscape.

Ethereum 101

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has seen explosive growth in 2020. This time last year, the total value locked (TVL, a way to quantify how much capital is following through the various decentralized protocols) was around $530 million. Today, there’s more than $10 billion sloshing around.

In February, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale covered the moment the ecosystem crossed the $1 billion milestone, opening the door to further heights and raising questions about its longevity. Here’s why that mattered:

$1B moment

It was only December when the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) market was worth less than $700 million. [On Feb. 7,] it hit $1 billion, a figure that even the most fervent blockchain skeptics would have a tough time dismissing as meaningless.

That figure is the measure of all the crypto held in projects that lend, hedge, abstract, swap or otherwise make structured bets using ethereum’s smart-contract powers, as totaled by DeFi Pulse.

To be clear, $1 billion is not how much money people are making on DeFi, but how much they have committed. Their “locked-in” collateral is used on various protocols to make a wide array of bets, from simple loans to complex derivatives.

“It proves that people around the world want access to more efficient, less biased, money,” Rune Christensen, the creator of DeFi leader MakerDAO, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.

Investor Spencer Noon of DTC Capital struck a similar note in an email to CoinDesk:

“No other smart contract platform comes close in terms of its developer mindshare, tooling and infrastructure, to the point where I don’t believe DeFi could exist anywhere else today. And perhaps most surprisingly, we’re finally seeing a credible case for ETH to accrue a long-term monetary premium as the only truly trustless collateral type in decentralized finance.”

But nothing big happens on Ethereum without Bitcoin diehards mocking it. In this case, former bitcoin developer Peter Todd weighed in, tweeting, “Decentralized smart contracts can’t hold people accountable for debt. For that you need guns.”

And rapid growth doesn’t always continue. For comparison, Kickstarter, the leading crowdfunding site, launched in 2009. It hit $1 billion in pledges in 2014. Six years later, it still hasn’t quite touched $5 billion.

Still, DeFi got there a lot quicker, and it’s much more complex than crowdfunding.

Ryan Sean Adams, a crypto investor and ETH booster on Twitter, tweeted the news, writing: “Software eating money. Software eating banks. The next decade will be wild.”

At stake

Of course, much of this explosive growth was prefigured by the success of the decentralized lending platform MakerDAO. One of the earliest DeFi protocols, how Maker works still boggles many minds.

CoinDesk’s multimedia team broke down how “the Godzilla of DeFi” creates DAI, why stablecoin interest rates fluctuate and what it means to collateralize crypto in this video from 2019.

Making MakerDAO

Stablecoins. The name is a bit of a misnomer. In theory, stablecoin prices are pegged to various fiat currencies or hard monies, like gold or silver, in an effort to keep the crypto tokens price, you guessed it, stable.

The benefits to a business that a stable token could provide are great. A stablecoin makes finance far easier than a volatile coin. Since the price is predictable, budgeting becomes less of a headache. But in practice this is a tough solution to make work. Take dai (DAI) for instance, the stablecoin designed by the Ethereum project MakerDAO.

In the last four years MakerDAO has become the most popular decentralized finance application on Ethereum. The MakerDAO project includes two tokens: MKR and dai: Dai is the stablecoin, MKR is the governance token.

While both tokens can be purchased directly on exchanges, dai is created when users of the system lock up ether (ETH). When users lock up ETH they can withdraw dai, which maintains a soft peg to the U.S. dollar.

Users can withdraw up to two thirds of the value of ether that was locked up. So someone depositing three hundred in ETH at today’s prices could then borrow up to around 50,000 dai, which would be worth roughly $50,000.

Yet, because the price of ether fluctuates so much, the MakerDAO system encourages users to over-collateralize. Meaning they’ll have to lock in more ether than they’ll get back in dai.

Much like a traditional credit card, dai loans accrue interest. In January of 2019, the interest rate, or stability fee, for a dai loan, was 0.5%. Sounds like a good interest rate compared to what banks offer.

Fluctuations

But that low rate hasn’t remained. Over the spring of 2019, dai interest rates have fluctuated dramatically. Dai’s price is kept one-to-one with the dollar by backing the token with an equal amount of debt. If there is more dai in the world than the market demands, an oversupply, the price will drop. So the system began to adjust by increasing the interest rate on all borrowers in order to encourage them to pay down part of the amount they took a loan for or close the line of credit altogether.

When people pay down their debt they pay it with dai, that dai gets burned or destroyed, which contracts the overall supply. A smaller supply should drive the price back up.

In order to close a loan, the user can only repay the principal with dai. They have to repay the interest accrued in MKR, both those coins are then burned as debt gets retired. Dai is destroyed because dai is only backed by debt. So without that debt in the ecosystem those coins are not needed. MKR is destroyed as an incentive for the MakerDAO community.

A dai loan could also be liquidated automatically. Should a person’s collateral dip below the minimum 150% collateralization, the system will liquidate their ETH holdings with a 13% penalty fee. That’s on top of the interest owed as well.

It’s a fee big enough few users want to get hit with. This is why rapid increases in the interest rates has been so controversial.

DAOs and decision makers

So who decides when to increase the interest rate and by how much. To explain that we have to explain one more concept: decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs.

The idea of the DAO is that lots and lots of people can manage and run an organization taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowd to make the optimal choice.

MakerDAO is a programmatic loan system but it’s also a DAO, governed by people who hold its MKR token. They get to decide on things like the interest rate, how much of one type of loan can be issued and more.

The MKR token has been attractive to hold: As long as people keep taking out dai loans and repaying them, the value should go up as MKR tokens get burned and interest is repaid.

Holding MKR also gives participants the chance to be a decision maker in an interesting new kind of financial organization. Collectively these people pay attention to the price of DAI and decide whether or not the interest rate needs to go up and down.

As pioneers of a new financial instrument there’s not much prior data for MKR holders to draw on to make an optimal decision. Nevertheless, as of this recording dai’s price appears to have returned to a steady dollar valuation across major cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks.

In that way MakerDAO functions as one of the best versions of a decentralized autonomous organization the industry can point to so far.

The ledger

Snap back to 2020 again and you can see how much the ecosystem has evolved. MakerDAO is just one of many multi-billion dollar protocols. A range of other lending, trading and minting tools have either launched or finally gained tractions.

Last month, during the heady days of the “Weird DeFi” moment, my former colleague Leigh Cuen wrote about the “normies” getting filthy rich using this ecosystem of products.

Making money

Ethereum whales undoubtedly drive the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement, but many people making money on DeFi trends are just regular Joes, so to speak.

One such trader, Joe, is a math student at a Canadian university. Just by playing with Ethereum software and his own calculations, he managed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2020. This wasn’t his first rodeo, however; he’s been trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for more than a year.

“I’m not a whale in the crypto world but I’m one of the top users of the DeFi protocol I use,” he said. “Before, when DeFi was smaller, there was a lot less competition.”

Since Weird DeFi’s food craze began, Joe said “high yields” are now available to newcomers “without a lot of technical knowledge.”

DeFi infrastructure

The DeFi mentality emphasizes open-source access to tools, services with low barriers to entry and distributed teams. Sometimes, this includes low barriers to entry for high-risk games.

According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams in June 2020, most of the Uniswap ecosystem relies on ConsenSys infrastructure services, like Infura. This has also proven to be the common pattern for copycat DeFi projects like SushiSwap. ConsenSys spokesperson James Beck said the Ethereum conglomerate restructured to make infrastructure and wallet services, like Infura and the DeFi-friendly wallet MetaMask, pillars of the company’s “core software business.”

ConsenSys’ head of product for Infura, Michael Godsey, said his team handled the “increased usage” from the food-themed yield farming spike, watching closely to understand “these new usage patterns.” Such DeFi experiments provide inspiration and research data for Ethereum startups, not chagrin.

In reference to the DEX tools people use to access these trading games, Godsey added, “Uniswap and MetaMask are two of our amazing customers and many yield farmers are utilizing their platform to participate in this new activity.”

As for Joe, the Canadian college student, he said he plans to keep stacking tokens because the broader DeFi movement is “sustainable and has been growing at a relatively slow pace for years.”

On the other hand, he said the trends over the past few months were heavily influenced by Compound’s token model. Joe reasoned these DeFi experiments might end in a “big crash” or slow fizzle.

“As long as risk-adjusted yield is higher than for other opportunities, I will keep using them,” he said.

U.S. constraints

Ripple Executive Chairman Chris Larsen threatened to pull his fintech firm out of the U.S. if what he termed the country’s hostile stance toward cryptocurrency companies does not soon change, according to Fortune. Ripple is battling investor allegations that XRP is a security as well as mixed signals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Larsen acknowledged that Ripple’s leaving the U.S. would do little to stop top-line federal regulatory oversight but said a softer host government would nonetheless help, adding nearly every other country has a better handling of crypto than the U.S. Larsen named Singapore and the U.K. as possible countries to rebase in.

New addresses

Bitcoin has seen a rapid rise in the creation of new addresses on the blockchain so far this month, with one industry executive saying it’s likely due to traders moving funds off the legally troubled BitMEX exchange. Others point elsewhere. Glassnode’s “entities net growth” metric rose sharply by 244% from 9,750 to 33,620 in the first six days of October. The surge in new entities picked up pace in the wake of BitMEX’s legal woes users’ panicked migration of funds to other exchanges. However, on-chain analyst Cole Garner said the spike probably represents an entry of new investors into the market, because the growth in new entities has kept pace, even after BitMEX withdrawals slowed.

CoinDesk U

CoinDesk researched and assembled a ranking of universities that provide the best blockchain education. This in-depth analysis measured the school’s scholarly impact, post-graduation job prospects and campus blockchain offerings – as well as survey responses – to determine the 46 top U.S. universities. Topping the list are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Cornell University; University of California, Berkeley; Stanford University and Harvard University. Many smaller regional, or liberal arts, universities also made the list. Read the full methodology.

Digital yuan

An official for China’s central bank has unveiled usage statistics of state-backed digital currency trials that were conducted in three Chinese cities. Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said on Monday the bank opened 113,300 consumer digital wallets and 8,859 corporate digital wallets for residents of Shenzhen, Suzhou and Xiong’an to pilot a digital yuan. The digital wallets processed RMB 1.1 billion ($162 million) across 3.1 million digital yuan transactions between April and August when the pilots launched and ended, Fan said, making it the most widely used central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a commercial setting.

Token swaps

MetaMask announced a new feature Tuesday: token swaps directly within the popular Ethereum browser extension and mobile application. The token-swapping feature will release first on its Firefox browser extension, before adding extensions for other browsers and MetaMask mobile. Up to now, to make a swap of tokens, an Ethereum user would need to go to the website of a specific decentralized exchange or exchange aggregator, sign in and run the swap. By building a token-swapping function into MetaMask itself, it should improve the user experience by automatically routing users to a service, cutting out a step.

While it is not unusual to see a company or an industry association exhort its members to help lobby on legislation, CoinShares has taken it one step further by enlisting its customers to take action against FCA’s crackdown.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

The cryptoasset investment and research platform today said it clearly disagrees with the City watchdog’s ban on the sale of crypto-based derivatives due to what it considers the prevalence of market abuses and that underlying assets had ‘no reliable basis for valuation’.

The ban will come into effect on January 6, 2021, and affects CFDs, options and futures, as well as exchange traded notes (ETNs) that relate to unregulated cryptoassets.

Coinshare’s derivatives have had a very successful year much like the rest of the cryptocurrency economy. Its product Bitcoin Tracker One (COINXBT:SS) yielded nearly 40 percent in year-to-date return.

CoinShares Unstirred by FCA NEW Rules

The FCA estimates the prohibition would save investors £53 million ($69 million) a year in losses, but it would not force them to liquidate their existing trades. However, CoinShares said the ban will not result in such savings or benefits; rather, it will only drive UK retail investors to unregulated crypto exchanges that offer far fewer protections.

CoinShares said it had several meetings with the FCA to dissuade them from banning crypto-related ETNs to UK retail investors. Using a ready template on its website, CoinShares urged its clients last year to swap out their personal details and submit a version of this response to the regulator via email.

“We see the FCA ban as further evidence that the UK is turning its back on innovation in digital assets and on regulatory coordination with other jurisdictions. It remains the only Western jurisdiction to ban digital assets based on the false belief that they have ‘no intrinsic value’,” it further states.

Coinshares already operates publicly traded crypto exchange-traded-notes (ETNs), which are regulated by the Swedish FSA. The company says they offer retail investors more ‘familiar channels’ to invest in the growing digital asset economy.

The firm states it plans to expand in other jurisdictions but still has a lot of work to do regarding dealing with regulators investigating digital assets.

However, the FCA considers these products are ‘ill-suited to retail consumers’ who cannot assess the risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain crypto-assets.

Furthermore, the company reassured its investors that it will continue to operate their products as normal. CoinShares indicated that it operates a broadly diversified business spanning across many jurisdictions. As a result of this diversification across business lines and geographies, the company does not expect the anticipated changes to regulation to have an adverse effect on its overall offering.",2020-10-07 18:41:57+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/japans-messaging-giant-line-introduces-crypto-lending-services/,"Japan's Messaging Giant Line Introduces Crypto Lending Services

Back in the summer of 2018, the Japanese messaging giant, Line Corp., launched a cryptocurrency exchange with over 30 digital assets. Now Line is introducing crypto lending services with five different crypto assets and a new lineup of decentralized applications (dapps).

The Japanese messaging software company, Line Corp., is a firm that developed the freeware application called “Line” for instant communications on a myriad of electronic devices. According to statistics, Line has roughly 80 million registered users leveraging the messenger.

The Line app launched in 2011 is similar to China’s Wechat and the South Korean competitor Kakao. Two years ago, Line Corp. revealed it was launching a crypto exchange with 30+ trading pairs and “low trading fees.”

This past August, Line introduced the company’s Bitmax wallet, the Line blockchain, and distributed ledger development platform. Line’s crypto exchange operator dubbed “LVC” announced on October 6 that the firm will allow cryptocurrency lending with five different crypto assets.

Crypto lending services and yield-bearing assets have been all the rage in 2020, and the industry continues to see exponential growth.

Essentially the new lending service allows customers to lend BTC, BCH, LTC, XRP, and ETH to the firm’s Bitmax subsidiary. Line lenders will be able to obtain a yield off of the assets borrowed in the form of a rental fee, a regional report detailed on Wednesday.

A loose translation of the announcement notes that the crypto lending service will begin on Thursday, October 7, 2020. The interest on the loans will be incurred ever day and Line Corp. disclosed the lending requirements to the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon.

If the user wants to return the money within a single day it is possible, while the longest term seems to be set at seven days for now. “LVC will carry out a campaign from the 7th to the 30th of this month to raise the annual loan rate to 10%,” the local report noted.

In addition to the crypto lending announcement, Line also revealed a number of distributed apps based on the Line blockchain on the same day. With lending and a myriad of decentralized applications (dapps), Line seems extremely focused on joining the decentralized finance (defi) revolution.

The platforms announced represent an “inaugural list of third-party services that are/will be offered on Line blockchain.” Third-party services disclosed include a mobile RPG game developed by Biscuitlabs, which is the Japanese version of the tale “Knight Story.”

Line also mentioned projects like Linksign a digital contract service, a blockchain social media service called Afan, a blockchain-based MMO strategy game dubbed “League of Kingdoms,” “Cryptodozer” a coin pusher game, Somesing a social karaoke app, and Theta.tv a video streaming platform.

“Line will continue striving to provide blockchain services and technologies that can be integrated into users’ daily lives,” the company said on Wednesday.

The round was led by Tim Draper’s Draper Associates, with participation from XBTO Ventures, 2020 Ventures, and others. Vishwanath said the round is still ongoing, and Unocoin is looking to raise an additional $1.5 million in the coming months.

The fresh capital has brought Unocoin’s valuation to $20 million, said Vishwanath. He added that it would be utilized for customer acquisition and growing Unocoin’s team.

But as Unocoin is already a revenue-generating company, the funding can be seen as more of a “kind of some insurance,” Vishwanath told The Block. “As we have money in the bank, it’ll help us grow faster with confidence when there is more demand,” said Vishwanath.

Founded in 2013, Unocoin currently has 1.3 million customers, and all of these are Indians, said Vishwanath. Out of these, about 250,000 are active customers, he said. As for Unocoin’s team size, Vishwanath said it is expected to grow to about 50 from the current 30 by mid next year, mainly by hiring customer service executives.

Unocoin clocks trading volumes of about $400,000 to $545,000 per day, said Vishwanath, adding that sometimes it goes up to $680,000 million a day. He noted that volumes have grown three times since March of this year after the Supreme Court of India lifted the crypto banking ban enacted by the Reserve Bank of India in April 2018.

The lifting of the ban has led to Indian crypto exchanges getting more venture support. Unocoin rival CoinDCX raised $5.5 million in two funding rounds, with backing from Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, and others. WazirX was acquired by Binance late last year.

As for Unocoin’s competitive advantage, Vishwanath said exchanges like CoinDCX and WazirX are more like “pure exchanges.” In contrast, Unocoin also runs a brokerage service, which helps first-time customers to get started with crypto.

“In these cases, we become the counterparty. Customers just have to specify how much they want to buy and sell for. They don’t have to go through the bid-based and ask- based buy and sell orders,” said Vishwanath, adding that Unocoin also runs an exchange which is more suitable for experienced users.

Looking ahead, Unocoin plans to also provide decentralized, collateral-backed lending services, said Vishwanath. “Say, for example, you collateralize bitcoin and get Indian rupees in return. And then you pay back rupees with interest, and then get your bitcoin back,” he said.

Today’s Series A brings Unocoin’s total funding to date to $6.5 million. The exchange has previously raised $3 million from investors like Digital Currency Group and Adam Draper’s Boost VC.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-financial-giant-sbi-acquires-taotao-crypto-exchange,"Japan's largest on-line financial conglomerate, SBI Holdings, now owns two licensed cryptocurrency trading platforms with its new acquisition of TaoTao exchange.

Formerly 40% owned by internet giant Yahoo! Japan’s YJFX, TaoTao launched its crypto trading service in May 2019.

With the new acquisition, SBI now has two crypto trading platforms as the company is already offering crypto trading services through its crypto-focused venture capital arm, SBI VC Trade. Operating a crypto asset exchange, SBI VC Trade has bee a subsidiary of SBI Securities since July 2019.

Per SBI, TaoTao’s acquisition will contribute to the company’s expertise to provide better crypto-related services:

SBI’s acquisition of TaoTao comes shortly after the exchange officially ended negotiations with Binance.

It is used in an almost mainstream way to pay for a variety of goods and services. There are even ATMs where you can withdraw Bitcoins.



It is far from being the only cryptocurrency out there, however. There are lots of other coins that all have some value and have some investors very excited, indeed. In fact, if you are looking to do things other than just buy and sell crypto, it is worth noting that other coins have a variety of uses.

In this article, I will give you some information on other coins so you can get an idea of whether you think they are worth buying for your specific needs.

# Dogecoin

What started out as a gag coin to poke fun at the hype of the cryptocurrency craze has become an actual currency. It is the darling of the counterculture styles that are interested in cryptocoins. But, don’t be fooled, it does have some value and can be considered a good investment choice.

The strength of the coin lies in the fact that it sticks to the original ideal of what Bitcoin was supposed to represent back in its early days. Dogecoin has a massive community feel to it where the people act almost democratically and with a common sense of togetherness. It doesn’t have a centralized authority and has something of a friendly vibe surrounding it.

You can check out the DOGE to BTC ticker and see that it is quite a stable coin and may make a good investment for some looking for a stable return and a good market cap.

# Ripple

One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin is its network latency. Since the hashes need to be encrypted one at a time and the process can take time, there is a slowdown when many transactions are happening at once. And the cost to mine them is quite high so fees are on the higher side with regards to other coins.

Ripple has done away with mining since every coin on its blockchain has been mined at the very beginning making it much faster and leaner than bitcoin.

It is also popular with investors because it has proved itself popular with traditional banking institutions. Since cross border transactions are very easy and fast with Ripple, they love to use it over their very own systems. Ripple has a very tangible value which traditional investors like.

# Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash owes its very existence to the slowness and lack of scalability with bitcoin. It was created after a hard fork was made on the blockchain which has larger blocks. The blocks on the Bitcoin Cash chain are 8mb rather than the traditional 1mb so they have much more computing power which speeds up the transactions.

Once again, since it is a coin that solves a problem, it has usefulness beyond just a vehicle for speculation so investors are very enthusiastic about it.

It marks the first time a non-fungible token (NFT) was auctioned at a major auction house, and the price exceeded expectations.

According to the auction house, an unknown buyer purchased ""Block 21,"" comprised of a physical piece of art and an NFT representing Satoshi Nakamoto for $131,250 at Christie's on Oct. 7 as part of its “Post-War and Contemporary Day Auction.” Bidding started at $22,000.

The artwork, created by Ben Gentilli with the Robert Alice project, is one of 40 creations in a series, and holds exactly 322,048 digits of Satoshi’s original Bitcoin (BTC) code. The series, titled ""Portraits of a Mind"", shows the cryptocurrency's 12.3 million digits of original code individually engraved and painted on 40 different circular panels stretching more than 50 meters in length.

Christie’s auction was for just one of the paintings in the series — ""Block 21"" — whose name references the scarcity of Bitcoin being capped at 21 million coins. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Bloq chairman Matthew Rozsak have also reportedly purchased pieces from Portraits of a Mind.

""The work is a symbolic expression of Satoshi’s vision, forged out of the very code that lies at the genesis of it all,"" states the Robert Alice website. “Portraits of a Mind explores the multi-faceted identities of Satoshi Nakamoto, in turn reflecting on the nature of both identity and portraiture in a newly decentralized age.”

Square bought a total of 4,709 bitcoins, which the company says represents about 1 percent of its total assets as of the end of the second quarter.

Square said it was making the purchase because it believes “bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” calling cryptocurrency “an instrument of economic empowerment” that “provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system.” Square has accepted bitcoin as a form of payment since 2014.

Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, has long been a proponent of bitcoin, saying in 2018 that he believes it will eventually become the world’s single currency within the next decade. Dorsey, who also owns an undisclosed amount of bitcoin personally, said during an earnings call in 2018 that “Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry and we want to learn as quickly as possible.”

Square added bitcoin trading to its Cash app in 2018, and last year, it formed Square Crypto, an independent team that contributes to bitcoin open-source work. Last month, Square launched the nonprofit Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance, aimed at keeping the open-source nature of cryptocurrency alive by pooling patents in a shared library to “defend against patent aggressors.”

Bitcoin’s price is around $10,775 at present.

In May, Square reported its bitcoin revenue for the first quarter was $306 million, on total revenue of $1.38 billion.

Square said Thursday it bought 4,709 bitcoins, worth approximately $50 million. This represents about 1% of Square's total assets as of the end of the second quarter of 2020.

The price of the digital currency has risen to around $10,724 from $7,100 in January, according to industry site CoinDesk, in a year roiled with the coronavirus pandemic. The digital currency did drop below $5,000 during the recession in March.

""We believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,"" said Square's Chief Financial Officer, Amrita Ahuja, in a release. ""As it grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way. For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.""

Square founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, is a advocate of the digital currency, saying in 2018 the cryptocurrency will eventually become the world's ""single currency."" However the founder of Twitter said it could take a long as a decade.

Using it or another cryptocurrency as a global currency would lower the barrier for Dorsey's payments company to enter new markets, he said in 2018.

Bitcoin has been marked by volatility in its 11-year existence. That and its high transaction costs have largely kept it from being used as an everyday payment method. Instead, it's seen by some backers as a store of value, or ""digital gold."" That global hedge use-case seemed unlikely in 2018 after it ended the year down more than 73%; however, some attribute its uptick in 2019 and 2020 to a hedge against the then U.S. China trade war and now coronavirus pandemic.

Square has enabled it clients to buy bitcoin on its Cash App since 2018.

Outspoken technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC on Tuesday that Social Capital uses bitcoin as a 1% hedge in its portfolio.

""This is an instrument we use as a hedge,"" Palihapitiya said. ""I don't think this is something that you trade and the more people obsess and focus, in my opinion at least, on what the price action is, the more that it will confound you, the more it will frustrate you. You buy it, you hold it, you put it away and you hope that you never need it,"" he added.

The report also indicates an interest in how enforcement will work in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

""I am grateful to the Cyber-Digital Task Force for producing this detailed report, which provides a cohesive, first-of-its kind framework for those seeking to understand federal enforcement priorities in this growing space,"" said Barr.

The report is divided into three parts, with the first providing a threat overview. According to the report, the illicit use of crypto usually falls into one of three categories: financial transactions for commissioned crimes; money laundering and shielding from tax reporting or other legal obligations; and hacks or theft of crypto venues. The second and third parts explore enforcement tools and ongoing challenges related to these types of crimes.

It also makes mention of the growing DeFi space, linking the initial coin offering boom (ICO) of 2017 with today's activity. Regulators have said that DeFi regulation has been slow-moving, but the report indicates that law enforcement officials are keeping an eye on the space.

""The ICO boom from a few years ago has given way to the exponential growth of Decentralized Finance markets in recent months — with all the associated complexities and difficulties for enforcers seeking to stay ahead of the curve and keep investors safe,"" said the report.

Much of the report focuses on the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology — if threats are addressed. It acknowledges digital assets as a significant opportunity for U.S. advancement, calling them a ""transformative way to store and exchange value,"" and urging members of the industry to work together with regulators to come up with solutions to promote innovation and protections.

""To promote public safety and protect national security, all stakeholders—from private industry to regulators, elected officials, and individual cryptocurrency users — will need to take steps to ensure cryptocurrency is not used as a platform for illegality. Indeed, for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is imperative that these risks be addressed,"" reads the report.

Cryptocurrency White Paper.final by MichaelPatrickMcSweeney on Scribd",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-enforcement-framework,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s Department of Justice (DOJ) believes cryptocurrencies pose an emerging challenge to law enforcement activities, according to a new publication filed Thursday.

The DOJ’s “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” document, published by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, outlines what cryptocurrencies are and their potential use cases, including sections on both legitimate and illicit uses (though the “legitimate uses” section was shorter and more skeptical). Crypto has been used to support terrorism, purchase illicit items, conduct blackmail and extortion, cryptojacking and launder funds, according to the document, and the DOJ has spent the last two years determining how best to address these issues.

“Those efforts are paying off,” wrote Sujit Raman, the task force’s chair, referencing recent cases against would-be token issuer Telegram; child-exploitation ring Welcome to Video; sanctions designations and other efforts. And while the report was published by the DOJ, it encompasses efforts by all parts of the federal government, including civil regulatory agencies.

In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society. Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies.”

The report itself is split into three sections: an overview of the cryptocurrency space and its current illicit uses; the laws and regulatory agencies that oversee the space; and the current challenges and potential strategies to address them.

The report warns that cryptocurrencies are more difficult for investigators to learn about than previous tools for executing crimes, citing pump-and-dump schemes as one example.

Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society. Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies.

Investigators must learn to use “specialized communications applications,” the report said. Further, the markets being used evolve rapidly, with the report pointing to how the initial coin offering boom has given way to decentralized finance markets. The fact that blockchains are borderless, allowing anyone from any part of the world to interact with the markets, “adds a further layer of complexity.”

“Finally, decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer exchangers, and anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that use non-public or private blockchains all can further obscure financial transactions from legitimate scrutiny,” the report said.

In short

Much of the first section of the report simply provides an overview of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledgers more broadly and how they’ve been used over the past few years.

The report distinguishes between virtual currencies, which are a “digital representation of value,” and cryptocurrencies, which it describes as being in a subset of virtual currencies that are decentralized and based on blockchains.

It goes on to explain addresses, wallets, miners and other aspects, noting that while some transactions are private and easy to query on the blockchain, some cryptocurrencies emphasize privacy (the DOJ does not appear to be a fan of these currencies).

“As discussed in Part I, a wide range of criminal activity may involve or be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrency. On numerous occasions, the Department of Justice has used available legal tools to pursue successful prosecutions of such activity,” the report said in the opening to its second section.

It summarizes the U.S. government’s actions over the past few years. In addition to criminal cases brought by the DOJ, civil cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were highlighted, such as the SEC’s case against Telegram, which raised $1.7 billion in an initial coin offering but ultimately had to refund investors.

Agencies with oversight or enforcement power in the space include the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the SEC, the CFTC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that provides standards and recommendations for international money laundering rules, also received a mention.

Enforcement

It is the third section, “Ongoing Challenges and Future Strategies,” however, the DOJ noted that some exchanges and entities play “jurisdictional arbitrage,” looking for the friendliest jurisdiction in which to operate. This can harm law enforcement agencies’ efforts to “investigate, prosecute and prevent criminal activity” that involves virtual assets, the report claimed.

“In the United States, AML/CFT standards have been in place for [money services businesses, or MSB] engaged in virtual asset activities since 2011, and yet many [virtual asset service providers, or VASP] still are operating in ways that do not comply with the [Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA] and other regulatory requirements,” the report said, referring to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism standards.

This concern is exacerbated with companies that operate across different countries. A VASP might apply a different standard within the U.S. than it does outside it, or use different standards for crypto-to-fiat transactions compared to crypto-to-crypto transactions, the report claimed.

“Such behaviors are flatly inconsistent with VASPs’ BSA obligations and can create significant financial intelligence gaps,” it said.

The DOJ report also took particular aim at privacy coins, mixers, tumblers and other tools that are intended to conceal aspects of transactions.

Any website that offers mixing or tumbling services is “engaged in money transmission,” meaning it is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act. Websites that don’t follow the BSA or similar international regulations might face criminal prosecution, the report said.

As part of this section, the DOJ maintained its right and ability to prosecute violations conducted by entities based outside the U.S. should those entities still involve U.S. persons or services.

“The Department also has robust authority to prosecute VASPs and other entities and individuals that violate U.S. law even when they are not located inside the United States,” the report said. “Where virtual asset transactions touch financial, data storage, or other computer systems within the United States, the Department generally has jurisdiction to prosecute the actors who direct or conduct those transactions.”

While the DOJ most recently filed charges against BitMEX, it has in the past also gone after other non-U.S. based entities, such as 1broker.

‘Response strategies’

The report similarly had an emphasis on national security concerns created by cryptocurrencies in its conclusion, saying rogue states and terrorists could take advantage of decentralized assets to undermine financial markets, avoid sanctions and fund harmful activities.

“As the use of cryptocurrency evolves and expands, so too will opportunities to commit crime and to do harm by exploiting cryptocurrency technology,” the report said. “Ultimately, illicit uses of cryptocurrency threaten not just public safety, but national security, as well … Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use that could challenge the ability of the United States and its allies to disrupt financial resources that would enable terrorist organizations to more successfully execute their deadly missions or to expand their influence.”

Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use that could challenge the ability of the United States and its allies to disrupt financial resources that would enable terrorist organizations to more successfully execute their deadly missions or to expand their influence.

A large part of the DOJ’s future efforts will depend on education around the cryptocurrency space, bringing regulators and government officials fully up to speed as the space evolves.

The report stressed that private stakeholders in the industry must work with regulators and elected officials.

The US Attorney General today released a report examining the dangers posed by cryptocurrencies.

Attorney General William Barr announced the release of his office’s “Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework”—which provides an overview of the “threats and enforcement challenges” related to increasing crypto adoption and how the Department of Justice can deal with them.

The 83-page document lays out the perceived dangers of cryptocurrencies—mainly that they are being used by criminals, according to the DOJ.

“Today, few technologies are more potentially transformative and disruptive—and more potentially susceptible to abuse—than cryptocurrency,” the report read.

“Indeed, despite its relatively brief existence, cryptocurrency technology plays a role in many of the most significant criminal and national security threats that the United States faces,” it continued—adding that cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to buy drugs on the internet, launder dirty funds, or fund terrorist groups.

The report also said that criminals can avoid being traced by using cryptocurrency instead of fiat and request digital assets to pay for illicit goods, such as child pornography or weapons—seemingly ignoring the fact that cash is used for much of the same, while crypto is transacted across transparent, public ledgers.

But the report also said that crypto can be beneficial to the US—if used wisely.

“To promote public safety and protect national security, all stakeholders—from private industry to regulators, elected officials, and individual cryptocurrency users—will need to take steps to ensure cryptocurrency is not used as a platform for illegality,” it said. “Indeed, for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is imperative that these risks be addressed.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Top executives at BitMEX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, will step back from their roles, the company said on Thursday, a week after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against them.

The company said last week it would “vigorously” fight the allegations after the U.S Department of Justice charged the exchange’s three founders, Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo with violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act. Gregory Dwyer, its first employee, was also charged.

Prosecutors said BitMEX had made itself a “vehicle” for money laundering and sanctions violations.

BitMEX said Hayes and Reed have “stepped back from all executive management responsibilities for their respective CEO and CTO roles with immediate effect,” adding they and Delo would not hold executive positions and that Dwyer would take a leave of absence from his role as head of business development.

Chief Operating Officer Vivien Khoo, will take over as chief executive. She previously held roles at Goldman Sachs and Hong Kong’s markets watchdog.

The statement said the management changes had been made with the “full approval” of the founders.

“These changes to our executive leadership mean we can focus on our core business of offering superior trading opportunities for all our clients,” David Wong, chairman of 100x Group, BitMEX’s parent, said in the statement.

Hayes and Delo did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent via their social media profiles and Reed could not be reached for comment. Dwyer’s lawyer, Sean Hecker, who earlier said his client would contest the charges, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

BitMEX is one of the world’s largest bitcoin futures trading platforms, popular for its high liquidity and compliance requirements that are seen as less onerous than those for futures venues regulated in major financial centres.",2020-10-08 10:50:29+00:00,https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2020/10/08/54981-incorporating-cryptocurrency-payments-into-your-online-casino,"By Ron Mendelson, Fast Offshore Founding Partner

rypto and virtual currencies are everywhere. They are no longer just something used on the dark web or by enthusiasts of technology. These kinds of digital payments are finding their way into everyday life and are well on their way to mainstream adoption. Bitcoin ATMs, crypto payment processors, crypto wallets, and even buying your groceries with non-fiat alternatives, this is the future of transactions.

Another sector that is growing exponentially is the online gambling sector. Forecasts suggest that we can expect a steady increase in the number of new users for the foreseeable future. But these new users want more than just a regular casino with regular payment methods. As consumers thirst for technology and innovation increases, so do their demands from companies like yours.

Cryptocurrency payments on online gambling sites or so-called Bitcoin casinos are becoming more popular and consumers are increasingly wanting to pay and withdraw in crypto. In this article, we will take a look at the benefits of cryptocurrency payments in the casino context and some of the best jurisdictions for licensing crypto casinos.

The benefits of offering crypto payments

There are several benefits to integrating cryptocurrency payments into your online casino or gambling platform. Whether you decide to offer both cryptocurrency and fiat, or solely cryptocurrency, here are just a few examples. .

Convenience

Providing your customers with multiple ways to pay is not only good customer service but it can increase the number of clients you have, and your retention rate. Not everyone has a bank account and if they do, not everyone wants to use it online for online gambling. Providing cryptocurrency payment integration allows your players to decide how they pay and to choose the option that is most suitable for them.

Privacy

There may be instances where players don’t want payments and withdrawals from online gambling sites to show up on their bank statements. The level of privacy and anonymity that cryptocurrency payments give is very attractive to users and can increase their loyalty as well as time spent on your site.

Lower cost

Bank transfers, card transfers, and other fiat payment processors can levy high fees against the user and the merchant. Cryptocurrency payments offer a lower-cost alternative for all involved.

More efficient

Depending on the processor or method you’re using, it can take hours or days to make transfers or withdraw funds from an online casino site. Cryptocurrency payments offer an almost instant transaction which saves time and keeps your customers happy.

Security

Cryptocurrency transactions, once executed, cannot be edited, changed, revoked, or tampered with in any way. This provides both the player and the merchant with an added layer of security and assurance. It cuts the risk of fraud and can also be useful in disputes overpayments or payouts.

Cross-border use

Cryptocurrencies are borderless and have the same value regardless of what country the holder is in. For those operating an international gaming platform, this is incredibly useful. Furthermore, transactions can be made quickly and in a low-cost manner, transcending borders, nations and continents.

No chargebacks

An issue with payments in the online gambling sector is that typically, there are high chargeback rates. A high rate can result in the termination of service with a payment processor or banking institution. With cryptocurrency, the transactions are immutable, meaning they cannot be reversed or charged back. Of course, when necessary, refunds can be given but these must be done directly with the platform.

Regulating cryptocurrency payments

There are several jurisdictions where you can integrate cryptocurrency payments with your existing online gambling license. Or, if you are a startup or looking to move to another jurisdiction, some are considered crypto-friendly and support your use of virtual currency.

The most highly recommended jurisdiction is Curacao. Acquiring a license there is cost-effective, efficient, and not overly complex. Once you have it in hand, you can provide all kinds of casino games to your clients as well as offer a range of payment methods, including cryptocurrency.

Another jurisdiction worth considering is Kahnawake. This First Nations reserve in Canada is renowned for its good reputation and reasonable online gambling license application process. While it costs more and takes longer than the Curacao license, it does carry a bit more weight in terms of prestige. They also welcome cryptocurrency casinos with no additional requirement for licensing or permissions.

If you are an established casino or have a bigger budget, a Malta online gambling license also provides for payments to be made in cryptocurrency. This is a recent development and the Malta Gaming Authority is still in the early stages of allowing such payments but it is possible to apply. The Malta gaming license is the gold standard in the industry and the government has a very positive and encouraging opinion on cryptocurrency and blockchain entrepreneurship.

The resilience of the dominant cryptocurrency has traders pleasantly surprised, as many analysts anticipated a larger pullback. Following BTC’s rebound above the critical $10,500 support level to just over $11,000, the sentiment is turning optimistic.

In the near term, traders believe $10,500 remains the most critical level for Bitcoin for numerous reasons. Most notably, it represents a historically important support level in both the ongoing cycle and previous price cycles. Throughout 2019, BTC consistently peaked at $10,500 and saw brutal rejection afterwards. Given that the $10,500 level has served as a heavy resistance area in the past, it is considered a strong support level.

Whale clusters or bubbles also show that defending $10,500 is key for Bitcoin to retain its momentum. Whale clusters, tracked by researchers at Whalemap, form when whales buy Bitcoin at a certain level. Recently, whale clusters have emerged in the $10,407 to $10,570 range, which means whales are likely accumulating. Since whales tend to trade with a longer time frame, there is a decent probability that the $10,570 area will remain as a strong support level.

In the medium term, traders foresee $13,000 as the main hurdle before Bitcoin sees a prolonged rally. According to the pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila,” previous macro price trends indicate $13,000 is the roadblock to an all-time high. If BTC continues to stabilize and consolidate above key support levels, the trader said a rally to a new record-high could occur in the longer term.

Whether Bitcoin can stay above $10,500 and eventually break out at $11,000 to test $13,000 remains the biggest challenge. Between the first five days of October, various negative macro factors slowed the momentum of BTC. Since then, particularly following Square’s high-profile investment into Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency has recovered. In the fourth quarter, the bullish scenario hinges on BTC’s strength above $10,500 and whether it can surge past $11,000.

Why did Bitcoin plunge in October?

In the first week of October, Bitcoin faced several threats that could have evolved into potential black swan events. On Oct. 1, the United States Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice charged BitMEX and its executives. They alleged that BitMEX violated the Bank Secrecy Act, arresting BitMEX chief technical officer Samuel Reed in Massachusetts. After the DoJ publicly released a statement on the arrest, Bitcoin fell by 5% in the following 48 hours.

Then, on Oct. 2, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Twitter that he had contracted COVID-19. The news quickly rattled financial markets, causing equities to slump and Bitcoin to pull back in tandem. In the span of two days, BTC faced two unexpected macro events that considerably slowed its momentum as it hovered above $10,900. Had the two events not occurred, a retest of the $11,000 resistance level would have been likely.

Now a week later, Bitcoin has recovered above its price level at which the BitMEX and Trump news came to light. The resilience of BTC against two events that could have potentially caused the markets to further plummet is encouraging.

Factors behind BTC’s recovery

There are several key factors that aided the recovery of Bitcoin from the initial drop below $10,500. First, the U.S. dollar has declined in the past 14 days, indirectly causing BTC and gold to rally. Second, the news around Square’s $50 million Bitcoin purchase lifted the overall sentiment. Third, some analysts state that BTC was bullish before the Square news happened, with a favorable technical structure.

When major decentralized finance tokens plunged, it led to nervousness in the market. According to “Light,” a pseudonymous options and futures trader, the short-term recovery of BTC is positive. In the near term, the trader suggested that an uptrend is more likely than a breakdown. “Bitcoin $BTC was already bullish before the Square news with no supply selling bottom of this trendline even as $YFI tried to kamikaze the whole market. Obvious what comes next.”

Compared to MicroStrategy’s $425 million bulk BTC purchase, the $50 million investment is nowhere large enough to solely cause Bitcoin to soar. While Square is an $81 billion conglomerate and $50 million is a decent-size investment, it is not a major bet, although the implications were deemed substantial. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, said the CFTC’s action against BitMEX is also a positive long-term development for Bitcoin:

“Markets do not like uncertainty and this also applies to digital assets, despite the apparent lack of consistent correlation to traditional assets. Some sort of resolution to the election drama in the US will be welcomed and the cleansing of the digital assets ecosystem, this time by the CFTC on Bitmex, is positive for long-term developments in the space.”

Where is BTC heading?

Based on the recent trend of BTC, its pullback in October, and subsequent recovery, traders remain neutral and optimistic. The majority are not largely bearish in the short to medium term due to the strength of the $10,500 support level. If the support breaks down, then the sentiment could change, but it has held up well so far.

Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph contributor, said that Bitcoin should first break the $11,000 to $11,200 resistance range, after which “acceleration” could occur. But there is also a possibility that BTC would see a low-volatility range between $10,500 to $11,200 in the foreseeable future.

Van de Poppe also emphasized that Bitcoin is likely in the early phase where smart money and institutions are beginning to enter. Square and MicroStrategy’s bold investments in BTC could lead to an improved perception of BTC as a store of value; at the latest, it’s a bullish sign in the long term for van de Poppe: “The market is in the early stages of Smart Money and Institutional Investors, as MicroStrategy and Square opt-out of the U.S. Dollar and opt-in on $BTC. Very bullish long term.”

Citing the realized volatility of BTC, which recently crashed to 20% for the seventh time in five years, other traders said a volatility spike is expected. Historically, when that has happened, the volatility of BTC spiked to 80% in the several months following. Given the likely upsurge of volatility in the near term, cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark believes a major price movement is expected: “I think that given this prolonged state of compression that we get a big move before the weekend for $BTC. Either direction, I doubt we get some cookie-cutter retest.”

In the short term, traders expect BTC to successfully retest the $11,000 resistance level and range between $10,500 to $11,000. In the medium term, analysts expect a potential breakout above $11,000, which could establish a broader range between $11,000 and $13,000 in the longer term, with the latter being the major roadblock to an all-time high. The confluence of a favorable technical structure, strong fundamentals as seen in Bitcoin’s hashrate, and growing institutional demand indicates that the general market sentiment remains positive.",,https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-how-square-invested-in-bitcoin-2020-10,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey shared how and why digital payments company Square bought 4,709 bitcoins for $50 million on Thursday.

Dorsey was keen to share how Square's team executed the trades, and revealed the process in a white paper on the same day.

Square's treasury team executed an over-the-counter transaction with a bitcoin broker using an average price of $10,617.

""This purchase from Square could make sure $10,000 remains a floor to the price,"" London Capital Group's head of research said.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has laid out how payment company Square invested $50 million into a block of nearly 5,000 bitcoins on Thursday.

""More important than Square investing $50mm in #Bitcoin is sharing how we did it (so others can do the same),"" Dorsey said in a tweet.

Dorsey intends to make bitcoin, which he believes will one day become the world's ""single currency,"" more accessible and useful to millions of people through Square's Cash App.

Square's treasury team executed an over-the-counter transaction with a bitcoin broker that already works with Cash App's trading product, the company said in a whitepaper.

To reduce cost and pricing risks, the team carried out trades using the average price of bitcoin over a prearranged 24-hour period. An average price of $10,617 was paid for each bitcoin.

Square said it ""invested heavily"" in a cryptocurrency infrastructure, or cold storage, to protect customer funds from potential hackers.

Aside from the security detail, the company said its crime insurance policy protects against internal, or external, theft in both digital and offline wallets.

Within Square's balance sheet, the $50 million bitcoin investment will be classified as ""other non-current assets."" But its short-term, or long-term, classification depends on the length of time for which the company plans to hold the assets.

For now, cryptocurrencies meet the definition of ""intangible assets"" under accounting principles.

Square is betting on bitcoin, because it believes the currency will feature in its future as a payment company, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.

""Cryptocurrency trading is notoriously susceptible to influencers advocating it,"" Lawler said. ""This purchase from Square could make sure $10,000 remains a floor to the price.""

Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade is supposed to boost processing speeds to 1,000 to 4,000 transactions per second, but for now the grumbling abounds. “Scalability has been a critical issue for Ethereum,” the analysis firm IntoTheBlock noted this week in a blog post.

All this creates an opening for competitors that are nowhere near ready to concede Ethereum’s first-mover advantage as the dominant smart-contract blockchain.

The list of challengers isn’t short. In no particular order, there’s Tron, EOS, Neo, Polkadot, Algorand, Cardano and Avalanche, among others. According to the data firm Messari, no fewer than 17 of these blockchains have tokens that trade, with market values of at least $100 million each.

Over the past year, Zilliqa’s ZIL token has returned the most, gaining 73% versus ETH. On the other end of the spectrum, EOS’ EOS tokens are down 56% in ether terms.

Some rivals aren’t looking to take on Ethereum per se, but are keen on stealing lucrative parts of the franchise.

Radix DLT says it’s one such firm – a blockchain built with the express purpose of becoming a home for the fast-growing cryptocurrency subsector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

CEO Piers Ridyard told CoinDesk in an interview this week that Ethereum’s one-size-fits-all model probably doesn’t cut the unique technical requirements of DeFi, and that’s crucial if operators are going to scale their platforms to the point where they could plausibly start to challenge big banks and Wall Street trading firms.

Ridyard is scheduled to appear on a virtual panel on Thursday, Oct. 14, at CoinDesk’s invest: ethereum economy conference, alongside Roham Gharegozlou of Dapper Labs. CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley is hosting. It’s at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

Ridyard said he’s not worried about Ethereum breaking away. The industry still has a long way to evolve, and there’s plenty of time to catch up or overtake the market leader.

“Technology moves at a breakneck speed and mind-numbingly slow pace at the same time,” Ridyard said. “Fundamentally we are still in the concrete-pouring phase of the industry.”

The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit

Ethereum has delivered many mind-boggling innovations – some by design, others out of necessity. With DeFi pushing the ecosystem, existing infrastructure is being maxed out. Can Ethereum 2.0 address these pain points? Is this the opportunity for so-called “Eth Killers”? We assess this critical fork in the road as Ethereum looks to level up.

$1B BTC

At invest: ethereum economy on Oct. 14, we will address the ramifications for investors as decentralized finance takes the crypto world by storm.

In a run-up to the event, our two-part CoinDesk Live: Inside the Ethereum Economy virtual miniseries introduces trending narratives we will break down at the main event: Why all the hype behind yield farming and food-inspired tokens? Should investors take them seriously or are they a fading trend?

Whether it’s wBTC, renBTC or tBTC, tokenized bitcoin is the hottest thing on Ethereum right now. A phenomenon that hardly existed at the beginning of this year has pushed the total value locked in bitcoin past $1.3 billion.

On Oct. 12, CoinDesk markets reporter Zack Voell discusses the yield farming phenomenon with Matt Luongo of Thesis, Jeff Garzik of Bloq, Loong Wang of Ren Project and Kiarash Mosayeri of BitGo.

Ethereum 101

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the latest decentralized tools to send the Ethereum economy into warp speed. NFTs are ways to append real-world or digital objects to a blockchain, usually Ethereum.

First brought to public consciousness in 2017 with the success of CryptoKitties, the sector is still largely focused on the goofy and surreal – there’s a booming art world, gaming sector and now even a place to itch your NSFW desires.

Brady Dale was the first to break down why and how NFTs got roped into the decentralized finance craze.

NFTs meet DeFi

NFTs have not captivated investor attention until quite recently because lending, borrowing and risk management – what we now call DeFi – have taken up all Ethereum’s oxygen in 2020. So Ethereans largely lost interest in NFTs there for a while – and who could blame them? You could buy them and sell them, and sometimes games would come together, but they seldom held players’ attention for very long. There were more dynamic markets to game; art’s fine but money is money.

Even when there had been buzz, some projects would rise up only to fade away, revealing a weakness in the NFT specification. CryptoStrikers, for example, a sports memorabilia project launched during the World Cup is long gone (soccer-focused Sorare has emerged in its wake).

Why is the marriage of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) happening now? It’s debatable but you can make an argument that it comes back to DeFi’s favorite robo-advisor for yield: Yearn.Finance.

When the DeFi gateway created Y.Insure, a way to do KYC-free insurance on any crypto asset, it used NFTs to represent the policy with insurers. So, once reminded of ERC-721’s existence by DeFi’s top Chad, the industry ran with it.

That’s the short story, the long story involves the financialization of these tradable assets.

Financialization

As much as people like owning expensive stuff in crypto, they like owning stuff they can sell whenever they want even more (call it a liquidity fetish). NFTs had managed to be expensive but they had not managed to be liquid, not until DeFi-thinking intervened.

The stranger products are emergent phenomena of that financialization. Brukhman gave the example of Ark Gallery, which is a DAO for CryptoPunks. The punks were made pre-ERC-721 and have become quite valuable as early, cool and rare (there are only 10,000 such punks, each completely distinct). Ark allows people to crowdfund a punk (owning a fraction of the token) and then voting on whether or not to sell it if there’s an offer.

If there is a successful offer, everyone gets a proportionate share of the payment, based on how much they own. This has made CryptoPunks trade at ever-higher prices, allowing more people to feel like they had a piece of one. It’s clear that the spikes in volume have gone much higher this year when viewed on NFT data site NonFungible.com.

NIFTEX has taken that even further. Launched early this year with funding from Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), NIFTEX started off creating indices for NFTs, such as digital real estate or digital cards. But the real innovation kicked off when the firm fractionalized expensive NFTs into what it calls shards (really, just ERC-20 tokens – fungible slivers of previously singular digital assets).

The shard system works somewhat like what Ark Gallery does, except only someone who holds one of the ERC-20 tokens that represents partial ownership of an item can make an offer. The offer automatically succeeds if it fails to receive enough objections in two weeks, with a clever strategy built in to punish low-ball bids.

NIFTEX did its first fractionalization in May and, like Ark, the firm is seeing a lot more liquidity. Shard holders own a fractionalized, extremely rare Axie Infinity card called Almace that saw over 1,000 ETH transacted in its first week after sharding. Joel Hubert, one of the two co-founders, estimated its liquidity all year would have been more like 300 or 400 ETH in a few trades, without sharding.

On NonFungible, Axie Infinity shows appreciably more dollars getting transacted even if the volumes are only bumped up slightly.

“I like where we’re at because Ethereum is all about experimentation,” Hubert said.

The larger point to all of this is that content is finding a path to fair remuneration on the internet.

Added Flamingo’s Desai, “When you start talking about how content creators are paid, that’s where DeFi comes in; and when you start talking about property of creators, that’s all NFTs.”

The ledger

While NFTs are usually written off as merely game pieces, like all decentralized technologies they have the power to bring financial services to the un- or underbanked. Just as the technology transcends particular blockchains, so too can it move beyond borders.

Leigh Callon Butler, a CoinDesk columnist and director of the consulting firm Emfarsis, wrote about an NFT game Philipinos turned to for making money during the coronavirus shutdown. (This excerpted essay was published first in August.)

Fun and games

In the Philippines, one popular blockchain-based game is even providing pathways out of poverty and helping spread the word about novel technology. Created by Sky Mavis, a Vietnamese startup, Axie Infinity is a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain where players breed, raise, battle and trade adorable digital critters called Axies.

Ijon Inton, an Axie player from Cabanatuan City, which is about 68 miles north of Manila in the province of Nueva Ecija, first learned about it in February of this year when his friend stumbled across an explainer video on YouTube. Intrigued by the “Play to Earn” element of the game, he decided to give it a go.

“At first I just want to try its legitimacy, and after a week of playing I was amazed with my first income,” said Inton, who is currently earning around 10,000 PHP ($206) per week from playing the game around the clock.

Inton soon invited his family to play, too, and after a few weeks, he also started telling his neighbors. A crypto trader since 2016, Inton helped his friends set up a Coins.ph account so they could buy their first ETH and get started. Now, there are more than 100 people in his local community playing to earn on Axie, including a 66-year-old grandmother.

The COVID-19 crisis, which has confined people to their homes and limited the usual opportunities to earn an income, combined with the compelling nature of the Axie game itself, has encouraged people who might not usually play with dapps to do just that.

“To a crypto investor, gaining $300 or $400 a month might not mean that much, but for these people it means the world,” said Gabby Dizon, the Filipino co-founder of mobile app development company Altitude Games. “It’s food on the table, it’s money for their families and it’s saving them when they cannot even leave the house during this pandemic.”

There are a number of ways to make money with Axies. For new players, the most common method is by earning the utility token, small love potion (SLP), and selling it via a liquidity pool at the decentralized trading platform, Uniswap. Issued as a reward when Axies win battles, SLP is in demand because it’s required to get a couple of Axies in the mood to breed.

Chatting with me via Zoom, Inton explains how earning SLP became his full-time job. Before COVID-19, the plan was to move to Japan and take up a new career as a trainee butcher. This is a common story for many Filipinos. Faced with a lack of job opportunities, they are forced to leave their families and seek employment abroad.

Inton was due to fly out in May. But now, with international travel suspended, he is stranded back home in the province. Behind him, I can see his wife nursing their baby in one arm, and in the other she’s playing one-handed Axie on her mobile phone. Each day they play around 20 hours combined, taking it in shifts.

She does four hours in the afternoon and another six around midnight, while he plays in the morning for eight hours and another two before bed. Together, they can rack up around 1,500 SLP per day, while sharing the caring duties for their three children aged six, four and 18 months. Currently, SLP is trading for under 2 PHP, but on June 8 it went as high as 11 PHP.

For more seasoned players, or those with greater risk appetite, higher returns can be made by trading the Axies themselves. Inton has dabbled in this space, breeding Axies and selling them for as much as 2,000 PHP ($41). Just last week, two very rare Axies were sold for 60 and 90 ETH. The highest price ever fetched for a single Axie currently sits at 110 ETH.

To put this kind of money into perspective: Since the first round of quarantine was enforced on the main island of Luzon, national unemployment has risen to an all-time high at 17.7% (compared to 5.1% a year ago) and GDP shrank 16.5% for the same period.

Further, with more than 100,000 overseas Filipino workers repatriated, the Asian Development Bank has estimated remittance losses somewhere between $31.4 billion and $54.3 billion this year. Last year, remittances made up over 10% of Philippine GDP – acting as a crucial lifeline for poor families, especially during a crisis.

At stake

Back to the theme of Brad Keoun’s introduction: the competition between various smart contract blockchains. Ethereum is certainly the dominant player, but it would be a mistake to see all alternative base layers as vying for the same pie.

Brady Dale covered the run-up to the Ready Layer One conference last spring, which sought to find common ground between the base layers.

Base layers

Togetherness is the message of Ready Layer One, a conference put together by the Web3 Foundation, Near, Cosmos, Tezos, Protocol Labs and Polkadot, all entities involved in building new blockchains designed to serve as the primary layer for distributed applications. Other blockchain projects may yet join.

The website describes the virtual gathering as follows: “Think of it as the intersection between a hackathon, a conference, a MasterClass seminar and a vaguely anarchist festival for developers and builders of a decentralized web.”

Ready Layer One reflects a big-tent approach to blockchain gatherings, not unlike CoinDesk’s own Consensus, which is also going virtual this year. While most gatherings tend to be protocol-specific, Ready Layer One is taking a more agnostic approach.

The event represented a combined effort to galvanize those already in the ecosystem to work on some of their shared problems together. CoinDesk recently reported on the idea of blockchain interoperability as a vision in which there will be “one network, many chains.”

“We think of blockchain technology as a public good to build a more open and innovative world, but it’s unclear yet what technologies and set of trade-offs really works,” Illia Polosukhin, a co-founder of NEAR, said.

Featuring two of the best-known interoperability projects, Cosmos and Polkadot, Ready Layer One reflects a real-world example of at least part of the industry betting that a rising tide will lift all boats.

Chris Ghent, from the marketing team at TQ, an organization working to advance the Tezos blockchain, said, “We don’t need people to commit to one thing but to commit to blockchains [in general].”

The target audience for the event is developers, and there’s no cost to attend. Participants just need to demonstrate some skin in the game either by showing they’ve already done blockchain work or by participating in the testnets, hackathons, staking demonstrations and other open calls issued by the organizing protocols.

Hands on

“The founding projects, they all have stuff that’s ready to go,” Zaki Manian, co-founder of a Cosmos-oriented staking company called Iqlusion said. “You can build with it and play with it right now.”

TQ’s Ghent sounded a similar note, saying the pitch really is to draw in what he called “qualified tinkerers.”

“If I want to build something on Cosmos, and Cosmos dies, can I build a similar thing on NEAR?” Manian said by way of example. The answer, he thinks, is yes, and if Ready Layer One can show that to developers, then those devs will see less risk in choosing to build on any of the Layer 1 networks.

There’s also going to be an element of dealing with cross-chain challenges, according to Ashely Tyson, who is helping to organize the event on behalf of the Near protocol.

“There are a few topics that cross all of the protocols that we’re going to be compiling themed workshops and mainstage talks around,” Tyson said. Before the world shut down, Near had been organizing small gatherings to discuss some of these issues, such as standards for using existing open source technology (like WebAssembly) in a blockchain context and efficiently keeping interoperability in mind.

There will be some updates on these topics and also calls for developers to get involved in research and development that should benefit all the projects.

Blockchains have potential but no one disputes that it’s not yet fully realized.

Poloshkin spoke to frustrations that the technology is not really ready to help in the current crisis. “The technologies we are all working on have an ability to help and change things in the coming months and years. But we are still far from the state where it can be used by the mass market,” he said.

Top shelf

Employees walk

Coinbase has lost 60 people from its 1,200-person staff after an updated mission statement from CEO Brian Armstrong sparked fierce debate over how companies should respond to today’s charged politics. In a companywide memo obtained by CoinDesk, Armstrong informed employees that 5% of the company’s workforce had accepted the severance package offered last week. The deadline for employees to signal their interest in the package was Wednesday, and Armstrong said he expects the number to be higher after a “handful of other conversations” are completed.

Crypto framework

Thursday, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr announced the release of “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,” a roadmap for policing the cryptocurrency landscape. The framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency, Barr said. “Despite its relatively brief existence, this technology already plays a role in many of the most significant criminal and national security threats our nation faces,” said Associate Deputy Attorney General Sujit Raman, chair of the Cyber-Digital Task Force, which wrote the report.

Bitcoin bites back

Bitcoin broke through $11,000 on Friday, reaching its highest price in almost three weeks. The rise comes a day after payments company Square announced it had put 1% of its total assets into the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The rally to $11,000 marked an upside break from the past two week’s range of about $10,500 and $10,800, a range the cryptocurrency held despite news of the KuCoin exchange hack, U.S. regulators bringing criminal and civil charges against BitMEX and President Donald Trump’s announcement he would end talks with Democratic lawmakers over a new fiscal stimulus package.

Core CBDC principles

A group of seven central banks along with the “central bank for central banks” has released a report setting out the “core principles” for how national digital currencies can help implement monetary policies. Prepared by the central banks of Canada, the U.K., Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the report states CBDCs should work alongside cash and other current payments, support “wider policy objectives” and “do no harm” to monetary and financial stability, and “promote” innovation and efficiency. Meanwhile, the Dutch central bank gave its first approval to a crypto exchange.

Lightning strikes

A vulnerability in LND versions 0.10.x and below has been disclosed to the Lightning Labs team, according to engineer Conner Fromknecht in the Lightning Network developer channel Thursday. In light of the disclosure, the firm is urging node operators to upgrade to versions 0.11.0 or higher as soon as possible. No known exploitations of the vulnerability have been found to date, but “circumstances surrounding the discovery resulted in a compressed disclosure timeline,” Fromknecht said. The vulnerability was “partially” disclosed with a detailed publishing of the findings promised Oct. 20.

It is a further blow to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, coming days after the US authorities indicted the owners of leading crypto derivatives exchange BitMex for operating without being US-registered and allegedly failing to follow anti-money-laundering rules.

In view of recent findings from the University of Cambridge that most firms involved in crypto investments are still operating without a licence, other operators are potentially vulnerable to indictments too.

It all sounds like bad news for anyone hoping that more investors will put money into cryptocurrencies. But on a closer inspection, I’m not so sure.

Drops and oceans?

The FCA is preventing retail investors from buying and selling the likes of cryptocurrency futures and options, which people often use as a way of hedging their bets on an underlying asset. For example, you might buy an option to sell a certain number of bitcoin at today’s price if the price falls by 10%, giving you an insurance policy in case the market moves against you.

The FCA said it was introducing the ban from January 6 because amateur investors were at risk of “sudden and unexpected losses”. The reasoning is that these people often don’t understand the market, there is lots of “market abuse and financial crime” in the sector, cryptocurrencies are very volatile and they are hard to value.

To stress, the ban is not being extended to professional traders or institutional firms like hedge funds, which have typically been allowed access to riskier financial products than the general population. It is about protecting people who might have been drawn to bitcoin thinking “it may be the currency of the future”, having “heard sensational news coverage about the rise and fall”. There are any number of splashy trading sites offering them quick and easy entry into this world, and YouTube influencers who enthusiastically encourage them to try complex trading.

Some 1.9 million people – around 4% of the adult population – own cryptocurrencies in the UK. Three-quarters have holdings worth less than £1,000 and would certainly qualify as retail investors. We don’t know what proportion of UK investors use crypto derivatives, but we do know that the worldwide trade in these financial products was nearly a fifth of the total crypto market in 2019 (and has been growing rapidly in 2020).

Yet retail investors are probably not the main users of derivatives. Trading site eToro said earlier this year that maybe only a tenth of their retail investor spend was on this segment. And with most of the UK contingent using non-UK based exchanges, it’s easy enough to avoid FCA jurisdiction. The FCA says the ban could reduce annual losses and fees to investors by between £19 million and £101 million.

The ban also doesn’t make much difference at a worldwide level. The UK crypto market is small beer compared to global cryptocurrency holdings, which are worth US$335 billion (£258 billion). You would not therefore have expected the FCA ban to have a material detrimental impact on the price of bitcoin or leading alternative coins like ethereum, and sure enough, it didn’t. In fact, it was widely expected by industry observers and had arguably already been priced in.

Volatility and excessive risk

The fact that the price of bitcoin is very volatile has historically been the scourge of this sector, with many specialists repeatedly saying that this prevents it from serving as a store of value and becoming a functional currency. You could argue that banning some derivatives trading has the potential to reduce this volatility.

When people buy derivatives, they can be highly levered, meaning that they are borrowing to increase the size of their trade to make greater potential gains (or losses). Many exchanges, typically in Asia, allow investors to borrow 15 times the size of the trade, while some offer over 100 times leverage.

When trades are leveraged, investors enter and exit the market more quickly, since their loss or gain is multiplied by the proportion they have borrowed. It’s this effect on the market that increases price volatility. Yet bitcoin has lately been trading at an all-time low for volatility, so the ban may not achieve much in this respect.

None of this is to say that the ban is meaningless. Derivatives make markets more efficient by allowing investors to hedge their bets, so even a partial ban in one major country has to be seen as a step backwards for cryptocurrencies. There is also a bigger danger for the industry that other leading global financial regulators such as the SEC in the US and BaFin in Germany may follow suit.

This damage could be greatly aggravated if the US or other authorities were to indict other unregistered exchanges like BitMex. That could cause a liquidity crisis as investors withdrew their money en masse. Again, we will have to wait and see what happens. BitMex has said that around 30% of customer funds have been withdrawn since the US issued charges, but insists it is open for “business as usual”.

But as far as the UK ban is concerned, I would argue on balance that curtailing excessive risk-taking by amateur traders in a sector where trading vanilla cryptocurrencies is risky enough seems logical. I have met many “retail investors” in crypto whose depth of knowledge is refreshing, far exceeding that of financial institutions, but there will certainly be others who don’t understand their risks.

To end on a positive note, part of the FCA’s reasoning for the ban was that there was “no reliable basis” for valuing cryptocurrencies. It did not say there was no value in cryptocurrencies. That is a noticeable shift from what regulators might have said in the past, and is a sign that bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted.",2020-10-09 13:56:25+00:00,https://decrypt.co/44469/standard-chartered-wants-to-hold-more-crypto-for-institutions,"In brief Standard Chartered is recruiting to grow their crypto team.

Two of the three vacancies show the bank intends to increase its holdings of cryptocurrency assets.

This will set the bank up to compete against investment giants like Fidelity.

Investment bank Standard Chartered is planning to grow its cryptocurrency holdings on its balance sheet on behalf of institutional investors. The bank has put out three job applications in the last two weeks to build out a crypto asset team to support this goal.

The bank already revealed it was planning on building a custody solution three months ago. However, two of the bank’s recently published vacancies show that Standard Chartered wants to actively grow its crypto assets under management. This puts Standard Chartered in a position to compete with investment giants like Fidelity, which has already launched a Bitcoin fund for wealthy investors.

“Reporting to Head of Sales and Product you will be responsible for the network management and product strategy that will pro-actively grow assets under management for crypto assets (crypto currencies and other unregulated tokens), targeting institutional investors,” Standard Chartered said in a job description.

In the past, Standard Chartered has already gained exposure to the cryptocurrency industry. In August 2019, the bank completed its first joint blockchain transaction with Linklogis, a supply chain financing service provider in China. Three months later, the bank joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an organization that promotes the use of Ethereum technology.

The three available roles are junior relationship manager (digital assets), network management, and head of crypto-asset technology risk. Each role is based in London and listed as full-time.

The network management role will cover the overall ecosystem that the custodian is connected to. The ecosystem includes trading venues and exchanges, issuers and services providers among others. The individual will be responsible for creating, developing and executing a network management strategy, the vacancy said, to “increase the value added services offered and grow assets under management for crypto assets.”



The head of crypto-asset technology risk will be at the forefront of the bank’s crypto strategy. The role will lead implementation of the bank’s strategy towards crypto-asset risk position, risk management, and risk appetite. The ideal candidate will have “extensive experience in emerging technology and/or technology in financial services,” according to the vacancy.

Lastly, the junior relationship manager will “manage and develop strong client and partner relationships with key decision makers and influencers through multiple touch points at various levels.” These levels include heads of business units, trading desks, and compliance, among others.",2020-10-09 15:08:34,https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-indian-crypto-exchange-unocoin/,"Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Bets Big on Indian Crypto Exchange, Undeterred by Crypto Ban Reports

American entrepreneur and venture capitalist Tim Draper has invested in Indian cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin despite regulatory uncertainty and reports of a possible crypto ban in India. Unocoin has seen the number of new users grow 10-fold since the supreme court quashed the banking restriction by the central bank.

Investments Flow Into Crypto Sector in India

The cryptocurrency sector in India continues to attract global investors as the government continues to deliberate on how cryptocurrencies will be treated in the country.

The latest round of investments went into Unocoin, one of India’s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges. At its peak, the company says it processed more than 2 billion rupees ($27.3 million) per month in cryptocurrency transactions for more than 1.3 million customers.

The Bangalore-based company founded in 2013 announced Thursday that its $5 million Series A funding round is near completion. It is led by Draper Associates, the company founded by high-profile venture capitalist Tim Draper, who is known for his early investments in Skype, Tesla, Twitter, and Robinhood. This funding round also saw participation from Xbto Ventures and 2020 Ventures. Unocoin claims that this funding round will raise its valuation to $20 million.

“We’ve seen a dramatic increase of crypto adoption in India following the lifting of an industry-wide ban by the Reserve Bank of India enacted in 2018,” Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath commented. “Customer growth rates have surged by more than 10X in the month the supreme court verdict was announced, accompanied by a 5X increase in trading volume in subsequent months.” Since the supreme court lifted the banking restriction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March, a growing number of investors and companies began seeking ways to enter the Indian crypto market. Vishwanath elaborated:

The funding will help us scale our business further, and give us a strong financial foothold to expand our platform’s offerings. We will double down on our efforts to improve our product features and offerings, which will enhance the overall usability and functionality for our customers.

“We were delighted to hear the verdict by the Indian supreme court, and we had been tracking Unocoin, the leader in India for bitcoin for years,” Draper said. “We are so thrilled that the stars aligned and we could finally back Unocoin. Every Indian should have a bitcoin account with Unocoin. It is a great way to do business in a currency that doesn’t devalue over time.”

Besides Tim Draper, a number of venture capitalists have invested in cryptocurrency companies in India. For example, another Indian crypto exchange, Coindcx, has raised millions of dollars from investors such as Polychain Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Bitmex operator HDR Group, and Coinbase Ventures. Crypto banking platform Cashaa recently raised $5 million from the Dubai-based investment advisory firm O1ex. Furthermore, Binance has set up a $50 million blockchain fund for India.

The Indian government is deliberating on a draft bill submitted by an inter-ministerial committee headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg that proposes a ban on cryptocurrencies. There have been reports that various ministries are discussing a ban bill. However, the Indian parliament’s Monsoon session ended abruptly without a cryptocurrency bill being introduced, and the Indian crypto industry is confident that the government will not ban cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, reports suggest that India will significantly increase its crypto market share this year.

These would allow holders to make payments via the internet and possibly even offline, competing with existing means of electronic payment such as digital wallets, online banks or cryptocurrencies.

Unlike these private solutions, an official digital currency would be backed by the central bank, making it “risk-free” like banknotes and coin.

While most projects are still at an early stage, they have switched into higher gear in the past year after Facebook Inc FB.O announced plans to create its own virtual token and the COVID-19 pandemic boosted digital payments.

A group of seven central banks coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements set out on Friday how a digital currency could function.

Here is what we know so far:

WHAT IS A CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY?

A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the electronic equivalent of cash.

Like a banknote or coin, it gives its holder a direct claim on the central bank, bypassing commercial banks and offering a greater level of security as a central bank can never run out of the currency it issues.

Access to central bank money beyond physical cash has so far been restricted to financial institutions. Extending it to the broader public could have major economic and financial repercussions.

WHY DO WE NEED IT?

Authorities say that a CBDC would provide a basic means of payment for all at a time when cash use is dwindling. It would also offer a safer and potentially cheaper alternative to private solutions.

Their main fear is losing control of the payment system if private currencies such as bitcoin BTC=BTSP or Facebook's proposed Libra are widely adopted.

This could make it harder for authorities to detect money-laundering and terrorism financing but also weaken central banks’ grip on the supply of money, which is one of the main avenues through which they steer the economy.

For many emerging countries, where a larger part of the population is unbanked, a CBDC could be a way to foster financial inclusion and extend the reach of the central bank’s monetary policy.

WHAT WOULD A DIGITAL CURRENCY LOOK LIKE?

Here’s where views differ.

A CBDC could take the form of a token saved on a physical device, like a mobile phone or a pre-paid card, making it easier to transfer offline and anonymously.

Alternatively, it could exist in accounts managed by an intermediary like a bank, which would help authorities police it and potentially remunerate it with an interest rate.

While the idea of a CBDC was born in part as a response to cryptocurrencies, there’s nothing to say it should use blockchain, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) that powers these tokens.

The People’s Bank of China said its digital yuan would not rely on blockchain.

WHICH CENTRAL BANKS ARE LEADING THE WAY?

The People’s Bank of China aims to become the first to issue a digital currency in its push to internationalise the yuan and reduce its dependence on the global dollar payment system.

Major state-run commercial banks are conducting large-scale internal testing of a digital wallet application, according to local media reports.

Some private companies, such as China’s largest ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing, are also participating in testing.

In Sweden, already the world’s least cash dependent economy, the Riksbank has also begun testing an e-krona.

The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have both launched consultations on the matter while the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve have so far taken a backseat.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

Central banks fear a massive migration to CBDC would hollow out commercial banks, depriving them of a cheap and stable source of funding like retail deposits.

In a crisis, this would make them vulnerable to a run on their coffers as clients would prefer the safety of an account guaranteed by the central bank.

For this reason, most designs envision a cap on how much each consumer would be allowed to hold in CBDC and, potentially, even a lower remuneration rate to reduce its attraction.

WHO’S BEHIND THE TECH?

Some central banks have hired major consulting firms to develop pilot schemes. Sweden's Riksbank, for instance, has partnered with Accenture Plc ACN.N for tests on its e-krona.

But others, mostly in smaller countries, have tapped cryptocurrency and blockchain startups.

Lithuania turned to Gibraltar-based blockchain firm NEM to issue the first CBDC in the euro zone.

The Bahamas hired local tech firm NZIA to design and implement its “Sand Dollar” CBDC platform while the Marshall Islands turned to New York-based blockchain firm SFB Technologies.",2020-10-09 07:18:04+00:00,,,

Catching up, the cryptos and blockchain had a rough ride earlier this year but they have stabilized recently.

In February, as the pandemic sent markets scurrying, things were looking grim for the cryptos:

During the last week, the spread of the coronavirus has been all over the news; the virus, which had remained well-contained in China, spread throughout South Korea, Iran, Italy, and is now reaching its fingers into other parts of Europe. The New York Times reported on Thursday that “the signs were everywhere…that the epidemic shaking much of the world was being viewed with growing alarm.” However, the spread of the virus doesn’t seem to have had the price-boosting effect that so many seemed to think it would–as news of the coronavirus’s proliferation has spread throughout the last week, BTC has come hurtling back down, stabilizing around $8,780 at press time. Rachel McIntosh, “The Impact of the Coronavirus on Bitcoin and Beyond” at Finance Magnates (February 28, 2020)

By March, a writer who covers the crypto and blockchain beat noted that the cryptos’ value rebounded quickly, relative to the stock market. Billy Bambrough thinks that governments’ eagerness to incur massive debt in order to fight the pandemic virus has been pushing more citizens to consider alternatives to government-minted (fiat) currency:

Google searches for bitcoin spiked ahead of the traditional and crypto market crash, more than doubling from the start of the month. Meanwhile, many bitcoin and crypto exchanges have reported a surge in users and trading volumes. Billy Bambrough, “Coronavirus COVID-19 Will Go Down In History As The Social Media And Bitcoin Pandemic” at Forbes (March 23, 2020)

However, writer Kyle Torpey, who follows bitcoin, notes that it took longer than gold to recover. Still, he agrees on the main point with Bambrough, quoting Messari co-founder Dan McArdle:

“When the Fed prints trillions of dollars out of nowhere and uses some of it to buy corporate junk bonds, but the government still takes 30 per cent of your paycheck, people start to feel like there’s something wrong with how our money works,” said McArdle. “In an environment where people begin to question the monetary system, alternatives such as bitcoin can draw a lot of attention.” Kyle Torpey, “The pandemic was bitcoin’s chance to shine. It hasn’t… yet” at Wired (April 22, 2020)

Fábio C. Canesin, co-founder of crypto currency exchange Nash, offered some thoughts on the plummet-and-surge story: Some cryptocurrency firms were caught unprepared for the crisis but, he says, the overall picture is promising:

Cryptocurrencies will become increasingly used as non-correlated investment options. If you look at the recent market crisis precipitated by the coronavirus, cryptocurrencies and the stock market were only correlated for a little over one week. Bitcoin’s drop was primarily a liquidity issue — gold had the same behavior in that period — and it quickly became apparent that the currency was oversold. The markets are once again uncorrelated. This will drive further interest in blockchain-based financial instruments. Fábio C. Canesin, “How COVID-19 Is Impacting Blockchain and Cryptocurrency” at SupplyChainBrain (May 21, 2020)

For some, crypto seems to be a cause. In March, Bambrough forecast significant crackdowns on civil liberties in the post-COVID world and defiantly predicted,

Bitcoin, a borderless and permissionless substitute to government-sanctioned fiat money, is going to be in high demand in the post-coronavirus world. Billy Bambrough, “Coronavirus COVID-19 Will Go Down In History As The Social Media And Bitcoin Pandemic” at Forbes (March 23, 2020)

These are all cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Why should we take them seriously? Some experts don’t. For example, economics prof Gary Smith wrote recently,

There is no logical reason for bitcoin returns to be affected by anything other than guesses about future bitcoin returns. Unlike bonds that yield interest, stocks that yield dividends, apartments that yield rent, businesses that yield profits, and other real investments, bitcoin doesn’t yield anything at all, so there is no compelling way to value bitcoin the way investors can value bonds, stocks, apartments, businesses, and other real investments. Gary Smith, “Computers excel at finding temporary patterns” at Mind Matters News

That said, as government debt scales unheard-of heights, people we might not have expected to are in fact taking private currencies seriously. Earlier this month, Twitter’s chief executive Jack Dorsey bought $50 million worth of bitcoin, causing a sudden jump in prices of bitcoin against dollars.

Facebook has been toying with the idea of minting its own currency, the Libra (a key deterrent is that Facebook is domiciled in the United States where Faceless bureaucrats refuse to Like the idea…).

Amazon has been rumored to be contemplating a similar move for years. Speculation and denial aside, if fiat currencies took a pandemic hit, Amazon’s global business is big enough to make the idea seriously researchable.

Bill Gates has also voiced sympathy for cryptos. Warren Buffett, by contrast, has blasted the idea and says he’ll never own a cryptocurrency.

The fallout from the COVID-19 coronavirus over the next decade will probably decide the near-term fate of the cryptos.

United States Attorney General (AG) William Barr says the recent publishing of the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework will help law enforcement to fight elements using digital currencies for illicit ends. Produced by the AG’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, the framework provides law enforcement with what Barr terms a “comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency.”

The publishing of the framework comes as U.S. regulators have been ratcheting up pressure with Bitmex executives and John McAfee being the latest casualties of the new approach. Still, top U.S. officials including FBI director Christopher Wray pay homage to this revolutionary technology which they say is important and promising.

In his remarks, Wray indicates that the new enforcement framework is only aimed at individuals that facilitate illicit trade using cryptocurrencies.

“At the FBI, we see first-hand the dangers posed when criminals bend the important technological promise of cryptocurrency to illicit ends,” says Wray. The director explains that employees at his agency have observed that “criminals (are now) using cryptocurrency to try to prevent us from following the money across a wide range of investigations.”

Cryptocurrencies are preferred when settling transactions that involve illicit goods that are sold on the dark web. In addition, ransomware criminals also prefer being paid cryptocurrencies because they perceive this to be difficult to track and trace.

Meanwhile, one member of the Cyber-Digital Task Force, Brian C. Rabbitt, again praises cryptocurrencies and blockchain saying they “present tremendous promise for the future.” However, Rabbitt still tapers this favorable view of cryptocurrencies by adding that “it is critical that these important innovations follow the law.”

Rabbitt makes it clear that there are red lines, which if crossed, law enforcement agencies will not hesitate to respond:

While the Department of Justice (DOJ) and its partners are committed to supporting the advancement of legitimate cryptocurrency technologies and uses, we will not hesitate to enforce the laws that govern these technologies when necessary to protect the public.

Another Task Force member, Beth A. Williams lauds the release of the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework, which reflects the DOJ’s extensive cooperation with domestic and international partners. Williams concludes that this cooperation is intended “to benefit lawful cryptocurrency users and the public at large.”

Meanwhile, in the document, the DOJ says it considers the use of anonymity enhancing cryptocurrencies (AECs) such as Monero, Zcash, and Dash “to be a high-risk activity that is indicative of possible criminal conduct.”

Unsurprisingly, the DOJ also says operators of mixers and tumblers “can be criminally liable for money laundering because these services are designed specifically to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of a financial transaction.”

Still, despite the publication of the enforcement framework, the DOJ says it recognizes the importance of working with interagency and international partners in order to enhance an already vigorous enforcement plan.

The growth in DEX use has been nothing short of exponential, with volumes pretty much doubling in August and September compared with the preceding months.

But is volume alone telling the whole story? Amid the DeFi frenzy, some of the biggest winners have been DeFi governance tokens. Kicking off with Compound’s COMP token in June, other projects that followed suit have seen similar patterns. Yam Finance’s YAM, SushSwap’s SUSHI and BurgerSwap’s BURGER have all seen massive popularity at launch, only for their price to start dropping once the initial hype dies off.

Given the current data, it’s relatively easy to trace a direct correlation between the meteoric rise of DEX volume and the craze for issuing governance tokens that, so far, have not been able to hold on to their value beyond the initial hype.

Echoes of the IPO craze?

Cryptocurrency has always borrowed terms and concepts from traditional finance. The idea of an initial coin offering is derived from its traditional cousin, the initial public offering. But while an IPO is a signal of investor confidence in the future of a company, ICOs were a free-for-all, allowing anyone to mint tokens, regardless of whether or not there was any demand that would generate value.

With DeFi tokens, there is an already-established product that’s providing some value to market participants. DeFi’s governance tokens offer holders a future stake in the development of the product. In this way, DeFi tokens are more comparable to the concept of an IPO than ICO tokens ever were.

However, after the lockup period of an IPO ends, most investors dump their shares on secondary markets, according to findings from financial services firm UBS. This trend doesn’t bode well for any early recipients of DeFi tokens, as they usually HODL. Of course, DeFi is very much in its infancy, so it’s too early to draw any concrete comparisons. COMP, the token that kicked all this off, is only three months old. Omri Ross, chief blockchain scientist at trading platform eToro, believes that DeFi tokens should still be approached with caution:

“The jury is still out on the valuation fundamentals for DeFi governance tokens. Given the novelty of the space and the many complex factors going into evaluating the fundamental value of a token, the pricing of governance tokens remains highly speculative.”

A lack of BTC correlation?

DeFi tokens may show eerie correlations with IPOs, but they buck a bigger trend within crypto markets. With a few exceptions, most coins tend to follow the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC). Currently, DeFi tokens are an anomaly in that respect. While BTC has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the last month or so, DeFi tokens have shown price movements entirely uncorrelated to BTC markets. Curis Wang, co-founder and CEO of Bitrue — an exchange that recently started offering both decentralized and centralized finance options — told Cointelegraph:

“I don’t believe that their prices will end up following BTC. Most users and investors of these DeFi coins are pretty knowledgeable about DeFi, cryptocurrencies, and finance in general, and they understand that the functions that these projects are facilitating are going so far beyond what BTC was ever aiming to do.”

All of these points raise some intriguing questions about the future direction of DeFi token markets. The concept of the IPO has sustained for decades. Investors still get excited enough to apply for an initial allocation of stocks, even if the numbers indicate they can expect to lose out. However, stock investors can, in some cases, hold their positions for decades. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has held stocks of Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo for over 30 years.

In the notoriously fickle world of crypto investing, it seems a stretch to think that any investors would hold onto DeFi tokens for that long, particularly if their value continues to decline. Furthermore, there’s also the question of whether the law of diminishing returns will kick in, which would mean that each new DeFi token entering the market would become progressively less valuable than its predecessors.

In a segment that seems to be propelled by hype, it appears to be more than just a possibility. If this does happen, then DeFi tokens may start behaving more like longer-established altcoins. This behavior would see them quickly settling into a place in the token rankings that more accurately reflects their longer-term value and mirrors BTC prices more closely.

A looming specter

All of this speculation doesn’t consider the one factor that could kill investor appetite for DeFi tokens entirely: regulation. Despite DeFi’s ambitions toward decentralization, few projects can claim to be truly decentralized. There are teams of people that maintain the underlying codebases, pay for the hosting of app data and take care of the user interfaces.

All the DeFi tokens in the world won’t stop the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network from coming after anyone they believe to be responsible for contravening U.S. regulations, if and when the time comes. However, Wang still believes that the time has yet to come and that no regulation will be implemented in the short to medium term:

“First of all, BTC has been around for a decade already and received widespread public attention at the end of 2018, but there is still almost no regulatory clarity around it in 2020. [...] Secondly, the whole point of DeFi is the decentralization aspect of it and when a project is open source, even if you somehow stop a team from working on a protocol, you can’t stop others elsewhere from forking or building on top of it.”

The recent charges against BitMEX have already highlighted the potential dangers crypto companies and platforms may face if discovered to be lacking in Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks — DeFi included. Furthermore, CipherTrace has also stated that DeFi could make an attractive haven for money launderers.

The fact that funds drained from the recent KuCoin exchange hack have made their way through Uniswap lends further credence to the idea. If the worst-case scenario happens, DeFi could go the way of the ICO, rendering DeFi governance tokens worthless as a result. EToro’s Ross thinks that this issue will eventually slow down the current DeFi craze: “DeFi products will likely face regulatory scrutiny as applications of blockchain technology find increasing adoption amongst a broader community of users.” He added:

“As the space will attract more funding, attention and regulation, which I think will be positive for the space, it may also require future protocols to integrate some KYC and AML building blocks.”

But for now at least, DeFi tokens offer dizzying returns for yield farmers who continue to make hay while the sun shines. What’s more, the craze shows no immediate signs of dying down, even though token prices are currently declining. However, those who’ve been around long enough to remember the post-ICO freeze of crypto’s long winter would do well to remain cautious of history repeating itself.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-banks-are-going-to-swallow-fiat-banks-in-3-years-or-even-less,"Within a few years, a younger generation of financial services customers are going to be able to walk into a bank and gain access to credit products, savings accounts and investments that can host both crypto and fiat assets. In fact, the inroads that will allow for all of this to happen are already breaking ground.

You probably already know that Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange based out of San Francisco, is now the first-ever cryptocurrency business in the United States to become a bank. For now, being an officially chartered bank means that Kraken will be able to offer more banking and funding options to existing customers. It also means Kraken Financial is going to be able to operate in multiple jurisdictions without having to deal with state-by-state compliance plans.

Kraken is currently working with Silvergate Bank to offer SWIFT and FedWire funding options to U.S. customers. More and more of these kinds of partnerships will become the status quo in the near future. That’s why now is the time for traditional banks that are lagging behind to start paying attention.

Silvergate Bank is a step ahead of the rest at the moment. The company boasts 880 digital asset companies as clients. Those clients have deposited more than $1.5 billion with the bank. That’s still a small amount of money relative to the market capitalizations of most major banks or even most major cryptocurrencies for that matter. That said, keep in mind that major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini are now customers of JPMorgan, even though CEO Jamie Dimon routinely denounced the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies just a few short years ago.

Consumers will soon define a “full service” bank as one that offers financial services in both crypto and fiat. The time to start acquiring the necessary tools of the crypto banking trade is right now. Banks need to start adapting or get left behind. Make no mistake about it.

But what tools do they actually need?

Blockchain forensics tools

A crime scene investigator can use a black light or fingerprint powder to uncover all kinds of evidence. The idea that Bitcoin or blockchains are completely private has been dispelled again and again. In fact, blockchain-based currencies are much more open to investigative methods than fiat currencies. It is certainly possible to uncover the origins of transactions. In order for banks to do that with cryptocurrency, they will need blockchain explorers and risk scoring tools that can go a step further than the current publicly provided services.

Those forensics tools already exist, and they allow investigators to follow digital paper trails across addresses, wallets, transactions, blockchains and other digital entities, using techniques like clustering and heuristics. Companies in this space are developing their own proprietary searching algorithms designed to detect the origins of concealed funds and unmask criminals.

Remember, traditional fiat is still the currency of choice for money laundering professionals. Cryptocurrency is in its nascent days and will emerge as a powerful force in reducing the money laundering risk around the world.

DeFi is not going to be the answer for the average consumer

Make no mistake about it, the decentralized finance sector of cryptocurrency holds virtually endless promise. Yield farming may be all the rage, but the DeFi sector is so much more than that.

DeFi projects can allow you to take technical and fundamental trading advice from other traders and only pay a fee if you make a profit. You can pour your capital into digital investment portfolios without having to pay mutual fund fees that can eat away at hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of your retirement portfolio. Investors can also hold derivatives of their desired cryptos without having to constantly switch between blockchains. These innovations are just the tip of the iceberg. As the market continues to mature, more and more DeFi projects will allow us to do things in the future that we are not even thinking about right now.

There is, however, one fundamental problem with all of this. The average banking customer isn’t going to engage with decentralized finance protocols for decades. Yes, the most avid crypto enthusiast knows enough to dig up the contract address of an ERC-20 token, trade it on decentralized exchanges, and invest that token through lending platforms and liquidity pools.

However, the average person is likely still going to want to talk to a banker from time to time, even if they hold most of their wealth in the form of cryptocurrency. Furthermore, governments around the world are working on their own government-backed cryptocurrencies, which the average consumer will definitely want access to at their bank of choice.

Sooner rather than later

What will happen if banks don’t join the party?

Any bank still approaching cryptocurrency with trepidation over the next 18 months is at risk of finding itself dead in the water at the hands of Kraken and other banks that jump on board and take the plunge.

Now is the time for traditional fiat banks to engage in empowering the individual with greater access to crypto. If they don’t, they will be swept away by the rising tide of cryptocurrencies ripe to reinvent the world’s financial system one way or another.

The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/better-regulation-needed-to-stop-crypto-tax-evaders-from-running-wild,"Antivirus software pioneer John McAfee, the founder of McAfee Associates — the company that released the first commercial antivirus software, McAfee VirusScan, in the late 1980s, contributing to the birth of multibillion-dollar industry — was indicted on five counts of tax evasion and five counts of willful failure to file a tax return, which could result in a maximum sentence of 30 years if convicted. He could also expect to pay U.S. taxes and penalties, according to the United States Department of Justice. The DOJ’s charges were announced shortly after the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission revealed it had brought civil charges against McAfee related to cryptocurrency offerings.

McAfee has been a controversial figure in several countries, not only in the U.S. He went into ""exile"" after claiming he had been charged with using cryptocurrencies against the U.S. government, foolishly tweeting last year from a boat, boasting about the fact that he hadn’t filed any U.S. tax returns.

According to the DOJ’s indictment — which was unsealed following his arrest in Spain, where he is pending extradition to the U.S. — McAfee failed to file tax returns for four years, from 2014 to 2018, despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements, cryptocurrencies and selling the rights to his life story to be used in a documentary. McAfee is accused of evading tax liability by having this income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts that were in the names of nominees. He allegedly also concealed assets in the names of others, such as a yacht and real estate property.

The sale or exchange of cryptocurrencies, the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for goods or services, and holding cryptocurrencies as an investment generally have tax consequences that could result in tax liability. Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions may be liable for taxes, penalties and interest. The Internal Revenue Service oversees the enforcement of the global taxable implications of cryptocurrency transactions via a virtual-currency compliance campaign led by its Withholding and International Individual Compliance practice area. The campaign aims to address global tax noncompliance related to the use of cryptocurrency through “multiple treatment streams, including outreach and examinations.”

Monitoring the IRS’s cryptocurrency tax collection initiatives

Nevertheless, despite the DOJ’s and IRS’s recent success in unveiling McAfee’s concealed cryptocurrency-related tax evasion, two reports — one released in late September by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, and the other released earlier this year by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO — sound the alarm on how the IRS’ efforts to ensure compliance with tax obligations for cryptocurrencies have been inadequate.

These reviews were initiated to evaluate the IRS’s efforts to ensure the accurate reporting of cryptocurrency transactions, in light of the fact that the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method is growing in popularity and, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, is emerging as an alternative asset to the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies.

Related: Not like before: Digital currencies debut amid COVID-19

Both the TIGTA and GAO audit reports find that the IRS has limited data on tax compliance for cryptocurrencies because of limited information reporting by third parties, such as financial institutions and crypto exchanges, due in part to unclear requirements and to thresholds that limit the number of cryptocurrency users who are subject to third-party reporting.

These audits focused on cryptocurrency exchanges because they play an important role in the transferability and stability of cryptocurrency by facilitating the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for customers in exchange for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. While these exchanges are in a position to provide important information for use by the IRS in tax administration, information reporting on cryptocurrency transactions from the exchanges is lacking.

Related: Virtual currency exchanges and US customers beware, IRS is coming

The IRS’s most recent tax gap study, issued in September 2019, found that noncompliance varies with the amount of information reported by third parties, such as employers, banks and partnerships. Items subject to substantial information reporting and withholding (e.g., wages) have a net misreporting rate of 1% for individual income tax. However, the net misreporting rate for items subject to some information reporting (e.g., partnership income) is 17%, and the net misreporting rate for items subject to little or no information reporting (e.g., non-farm proprietor income) is 55%.

Monitoring OECD’s digital tax proposal

Two years ago, during the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires, the world’s economic leaders agreed that technology such as cryptocurrency and blockchain, given its borderless nature and increasing ability to automate tasks, is significantly changing the global economy.

The G-20 settled on characterizing cryptocurrencies as assets, thereby setting the stage for cryptocurrencies to be adopted as a new digital asset class. The group confirmed its commitment to following the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework, studying international nexus and profit-allocation concepts for taxing the digital economy, and developing a new approach by 2020 — when the COVID-19 pandemic forced governments worldwide to focus on bringing blockchain tech to their financial services.

Nevertheless, OECD’s global digital tax approach concerning international nexus and profit-allocation concepts has drawn criticism from the National Taxpayers Union, which is laid out in a new issue brief in response to a leaked draft of OECD’s most recent proposal. The NTU’s new report states that the plan put forward by OECD is aimed at U.S. consumers and businesses that operate internationally, attempting to levy a minimum tax on a poorly defined tax base. The NTU and its sister organization the NTU Foundation have previously expressed concerns about the approach that international bodies such as OECD are taking regarding taxing the digital economy. As NTU’s president, Pete Sepp, explained:

“One practical step should be to restore transparency and stakeholder engagement in the further development of Pillars One and Two — two principles which OECD had heretofore largely embraced but has recently made a low priority. Equally troubling is that there are currently no concrete plans at OECD to comprehensively assess the financial and compliance burdens of the proposals until after they are approved. [...] Backward-facing tax policymaking is rarely a formula for success.”

From the dynamics of staking to the architecture of sharding, there haven’t been many topics Ethereum 2.0 core developers have shied away from discussing over the past five weeks on “Developer Perspectives: Ethereum 2.0.”

Each discussion, however, has sparked new questions about the ramifications of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake on the crypto markets and the broader blockchain industry.

“There’s a lot of unanswered questions about how the markets are going to behave,” said Casey, CoinDesk’s chief content officer. “Do we end up with a split, [with] two versions of ethereum or at least two tokens that trade differently in the marketplace?”

Casey added that financial engineers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space will likely seek to unlock the liquidity of staked ETH on Ethereum 2.0 before token transfers are officially enabled on the network. What new DeFi products are created, their attributes and, most important, their impact on the value of ETH remain to be determined.

Along with lingering questions over how the markets will react to the launch of Ethereum 2.0, there’s also uncertainty over how the launch will affect the competitive landscape for dapp users and dapp developers in the crypto industry.

“What does the multi-chain future look like?” asked Stanley, CoinDesk’s managing director of events content. “If Eth 2.0 succeeds, … what does that mean for all these other [smart contract] chains out there? Are they going to go away or just cease to exist? I don’t think that’s the case.”

With the recent popularity around yield farming and liquidity mining on Ethereum, Stanley also questioned what the real incentives are for users holding large amounts of ETH, upwards of $11,000 worth, to stake on Ethereum 2.0 when they could earn “100x returns farming ‘hotdog coin’ or whatever the meme coin of the day is.”

The California-based private American venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has published a documentary called “Crypto Startup School.” The documentary is different from other blockchain films, as the 30-minute video shows some of the procedures leveraged while invoking a crypto-focused startup.

On October 9, 2020, the company Andreessen Horowitz published a new documentary on Youtube called “Crypto Startup School,” alongside the 14 lectures that go along with the experiment. The documentary covers a course Andreessen Horowitz recently held with over 40 participants who learn the process of starting a crypto company.

“This 30-minute, behind-the-scenes documentary follows several students as they go through a new program for crypto entrepreneurs called ‘Crypto Startup School,’” the Youtube video description notes. “Along the way, they develop crypto projects, try to find investors and build businesses, and face challenges that are familiar to every founder — all against the backdrop of an unprecedented pandemic.”

The documentary shows a slew of the students who participated in Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto startup course. Alongside this, a number of crypto executives from established firms joined the course and were featured in the documentary and lectures. This includes individuals such as Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, Chris Dixon and Tina Ferguson from Andreessen Horowitz, and the angel investor Balaji Srinivasan as well.

Marc Andreessen the cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz is a big believer in bitcoin and in 2014, Andreessen wrote a popular opinion article called “Why Bitcoin Matters.” Six years later, while the global economy shuddered from the government response to Covid-19, Andreessen Horowitz invested over $500 million into the digital currency economy with the “Crypto Fund II.”

“We think it’s important to keep investing in the long-term development of the internet to address the needs of the coming decades,” Andreessen Horowitz said on May 1, 2020. “That’s why we’re excited to announce a new $515 million fund that will be used to invest in crypto networks and businesses.”

“Crypto Startup School” took place while the coronavirus lockdowns happened and a great portion of things were done under lockdown.

The crypto course participants learned about applications, opportunities, business models, funding, software development, and running a crypto operation with people who work remotely.

When Microstrategy Inc. bought $425 million bitcoin in the last two months, the decision became an important stamp of institutional approval of the top crypto’s credentials as a mature, safe-haven asset. The American technology firm had just made bitcoin its primary reserve asset to hedge against fiat inflation. Now, it appears major global companies are following Microstrategy’s bitcoin strategy.

The website bitcointreasuries.org is curating bitcoin treasures held in reserve by publicly traded companies from across the world. At the time of writing, 13 companies with a combined total 598,237 BTC, or 2.85% of the total supply of 21 million BTC, are listed on the page. Here is a closer look at some of the entities.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — 2.14%

Grayscale Investments is, perhaps, an unsurprising pacesetter in this regard. Through its Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC), which owns and tracks the price of bitcoin, the New York-based firm now holds 449,596 BTC, valued at $5.1 billion currently, and representing 2.14% of the digital asset’s total circulating supply. Listed on the OTCQX market, the Trust has snapped up 70% of all newly minted bitcoin in 2020, almost doubling its portfolio in the process.

It is noteworthy that Gbtc holds this BTC on behalf of accredited corporate investors, who typically value privacy and bitcoin’s store of value credentials while calculatively reluctant to gain direct exposure to the asset. Grayscale’s bitcoin trust “became the first publicly quoted securities solely invested in, and deriving value from, the price of bitcoin” when it launched in 2013. The company operates ten crypto investment products focused on institutional investors. Funds cover ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), zcash, XRP, and more.

Microstrategy Inc. — 0.18%

Grayscale may be a pioneer, but it is Microstrategy that’s grabbed all the headlines in recent weeks. The Nasdaq-listed company, which develops mobile software as well as provide cloud-based services, bought $425 million worth of bitcoin in August and September, making BTC Microstrategy’s main reserve asset.

The multi-billion-dollar U.S. firm now holds a total 38,250 BTC, in a move that signals increasing corporate adoption. At current exchange rates, the portfolio is worth more than $433 million – a gain of $8 million, coming as it does against a backdrop of increased stimulus spending that has sent global fiat currencies into a tailspin. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor is particularly upbeat.

“This investment reflects our belief that bitcoin, as the world’s most widely adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash,” he says.

Square Inc. — 0.022%

Corporate adoption may not be considered a trend just yet, but news that Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. moved one percent of its total assets into bitcoin suggests something may be building up. On Oct. 8, the New York Stock Exchange-listed mobile payments firm announced it spent $50 million buying 4,709 bitcoin. According to Amrita Ahuja, chief financial officer of Square, “bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future”.

On this account, the company intends that “as it (bitcoin) grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way. For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.” Bitcoin reacted positively to Square’s news, soaring 8% in the last 72 hours to more than $11,300 from $10,500. With a market capitalization of over $83 billion, Square provides software and hardware payment solutions. In 2019, the company reported revenue of $4.7 billion. It has offices in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Coinshares — 0.33%

Coinshares Ltd is a U.K.- based investment fund that is primarily focused on direct and indirect exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company manages over $1 billion in digital assets, with bitcoin making up nearly 80% of this. Coinshares currently holds – on behalf of investors – a total 69,730 BTC, valued at $790 million, according to bitcointreasuries.org.

Through its subsidiary XBT Provider, Coinshares offers two globally traded exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in bitcoin and ethereum, Bitcoin Tracker One and BTC Tracker Euro, and ethereum, Ether Tracker One and ETH Tracker Euro, respectively. Its ETNs are listed on the Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm, Sweden and retail investors can buy the instruments. However, the product suffered a blow when the U.K. financial regulator banned the sale of ETNs to retail clients in the country recently.

Other Listings

Several other publicly traded companies are listed on the bitcoin treasuries website. They include bitcoin miners Hut 8 Mining, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), and Argo Blockchain of the London Stock Exchange. Both companies hold bitcoin as a reserve asset. At the end of June, Hut 8 held 2,954 BTC while Argo Blockchain had 126 BTC by the end of September. Another mining entity, Riot Blockchain, Inc had 1,053 bitcoin in its reserves in June.

Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings, a TSX-listed firm that “seeks to institutionalize the digital asset and blockchain space,” holds 16,651 BTC, worth about $188 million at prevailing market prices. The company provides asset management, investing, advisory and trading services as well as making principal investments. Voyager Digital Ltd, Cypherpunk Holdings, and DigitalX also make the list of those public companies holding bitcoin as a hedge against fiat inflation.

Key Takeaways Revenue for Bitcoin miners fell by 30% after the block reward halving in May 2020.

Ethereum miners saw revenues triple since March as DeFi pushed transaction fees to new highs.

By year end Crypto Briefing projects total annual mining revenues of $4.6 billion for Bitcoin and $2.2 billion for Ethereum.

This year saw drastic changes in the mining industry, with the halving and DeFi shaking up the sector. Ethereum miners saw their incomes triple since February, while revenues for Bitcoin miners fell by 30% following the halving.

Ethereum Mining Approaches Profit Parity with Bitcoin

Cryptocurrency mining this year is divided into two distinct eras: before and after the halving. Around the same time as the halving is when the decentralized finance trend started to take off.

Before the halving and DeFi, Bitcoin miners made four to five times more than Ethereum miners in the first quarter of 2020. Bitcoin miners earned $400 million on average in the first nine months of 2020, while those mining Ethereum made $150 million in all, according to data pulled from blockchain data firm Glassnode.

Total BTC mining revenue fell by roughly 30% after halving. June was a sluggish month for Bitcoin miners, with block rewards and fees bringing in $272 million. Once hashrates stabilized after the halving, miners earned an average of $350 million in revenue each month.

ETH Miners Profit from DeFi

The DeFi boom caused Ethereum mining revenues to triple since the beginning of the year, nearly reaching parity with Bitcoin in August and September—despite the Ethereum network having just one-fifth of the market capitalization of Bitcoin.

Congestion on the Ethereum network reached unsustainable levels beginning in August, with gas fees reaching all-time highs. Congestion resulted in miners collecting more transaction fees, increasing revenues. Miners earned an average of $305 million per month in ETH, compared to a monthly $90 million over the first two quarters of the year.

In all, Bitcoin miners made $3.55 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.34 billion year-to-date. Projections by Crypto Briefing predict total BTC mining revenue of $4.6 billion for 2020. Assuming gas prices stay above 100 gwei, Ethereum miners should make around $2.2 billion by year-end.

This dashed hopes of many investors who believed Bitcoin price would rally higher if an EFT was approved.

Although investors no longer pin BTC’s future on the existence of an ETF, regulators could eventually adjust their anti-crypto stance in the future.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that the regulator will have to become accommodative to innovation as several people from both the crypto space and traditional financial institutions seek their guidance.

Bloomberg’s latest crypto newsletter predicts that a Bitcoin ETF could see the light of the day if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is elected as the next U.S. President. The author believes that a change in guard may bring regulatory clarity that could attract investments into digital assets.

However, even if President Donald Trump is re-elected, Bloomberg expects Bitcoin to extend its uptrend through his second term as the digital asset will be buoyed by the rising debt-to-GDP, quantitative easing, and Bitcoin hash rate.

Even if Bitcoin only rallies at half the speed of its 1,400% gain from 2016 to 2020, it would rally to $80,000 by 2024.

The long-term forecasts are encouraging and so are the short-term charts. Let’s analyze the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short-term.

BTC/USD

The breakout of the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 8 attracted buyers who pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $11,178 on Oct. 10. However, the bears have not yet given up completely as they sold the rally to $11,482.44 on Sep. 10.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls used the dip to buy and did not allow the price to break below $11,178. This suggests that the sentiment has changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips.

The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the relative strength index above 64 indicate that the advantage is currently with the bulls.

If the buyers can push the price above the overhead resistance at $11,500, the next stop for the BTC/USD pair could be $12,000 and then $12,460.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average ($10,853). Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The trend on the 4-hour chart has turned bullish with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought territory. The buyers will again attempt to push the price above $11,500 and if they succeed momentum is likely to pick up.

However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it could consolidate in a tight range of $11,468.98–$11,178 for some time. A break below $11,178 will be a sign of short-term weakness.

XRP/USD

The bears defended the $0.26 overhead resistance on Oct. 10, but they could not sustain the selling pressure today. This shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip and are currently attempting to push XRP above $0.26.

XRP/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

A breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.26 will complete an inverse head and shoulders setup that has a pattern target of $0.300288. The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI close to 60 suggest advantage to the bulls.

Contrary to this assumption, if the XRP/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.246), it will show that the bears are aggressively shorting on rallies to $0.26.

XRP/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are attempting to defend the $0.26 resistance but they have not been able to sink the price below the 20-EMA. This suggests that the bulls are accumulating on dips.

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near 60 suggest that bulls have the upper hand in the short-term.

A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign of weakness and the advantage will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink the price below the $0.24 support.

Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $0.26, a new uptrend is likely. The pair could face resistance at $0.266 and then at $0.28 but the trend will remain bullish as long as the price remains above the neckline.

ADA/USD

The failure of the bears to sustain Cardano (ADA) below $0.90, between Oct. 7 to 9, attracted aggressive buying by the bulls who then pushed the price above the moving averages.

ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI near 62 suggest that the buyers have the upper hand. If they can propel the price above the neckline, it will complete a reversal setup that has a pattern target of $0.1331.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the breakout above $0.104044 was a bull trap.

ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The rebound off the immediate support at $0.1040440 suggests that the sentiment has turned positive as the bulls are viewing dips as a buying opportunity.

However, unless the bulls drive the price above the neckline, the bears will again try to sink the pair back below $0.1040440 and the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the 50-simple moving average and below it to $0.90.

Conversely, if the pair rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will indicate strength and increase the possibility of a break above the neckline.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) is in an uptrend with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone. The bulls will now try to extend the up-move to $140 and above it to $150.

XMR/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

In a strong uptrend, the corrections usually last for one to three days and the bulls view the dips to the 20-day EMA ($105.96) as a buying opportunity because it gives a low-risk entry point with a good risk to reward ratio.

However, if the XMR/USD pair turns down from the current levels and drops back below $121.427, the bears will try to drag the price to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support will be the first sign of weakness.

XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The ascending triangle pattern completed on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $113.211. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $132.739. The buyers are currently attempting to sustain the price above $121.427.

If they succeed, it will suggest that $121.427 will now act as a strong support. Even if the price dips back below this level, the bulls will again try to buy the dip to the 20-EMA.

If the pair rebounds off this support, it will indicate strength and increase the possibility of a resumption of the uptrend.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) broke out and closed (UTC time) above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Oct. 10. This breakout has seen further buying today and the bulls have pushed the price above the $5.877 resistance.

ATOM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ATOM/USD pair could now start a rally that may reach $7.40 and then $8.877. The 20-day EMA ($5.17) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, which suggests a possible change in trend.

Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels, the bears will try to sink the price back below the neckline and the 20-day EMA.

If that happens, it will indicate that the current breakout was a fake one. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair drops below the right shoulder at $4.549.

ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $5.877 that could start a new uptrend. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI is in the positive territory suggest advantage to the bulls.

This positive view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to defend the breakout level during the next retest. If the price becomes pinned below the neckline this will be a sign of weakness.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.coindesk.com/fca-ban-crypto-derivatives-ridiculous,"This week the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the country’s financial services, issued a ban on the sale of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETN) to retail investors.

While this may not seem particularly material to crypto asset markets overall – U.K. retail investors weren’t that much into crypto derivatives anyway, and the market hardly reacted at all – it is worth paying attention to for the alarming message contained within.

This message loudly says: “We don’t like crypto assets.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

In case you think I’m exaggerating, the policy statement opens with the sentence: “There is growing evidence that cryptoassets are causing harm to consumers and markets.” (Actually, there isn’t, and to see a financial regulator make such a bold claim with no supporting evidence is jarring.)

The message itself is fine; not everyone likes crypto assets. But this is a financial regulator whose job includes protecting investors, not passing judgement on new asset groups. The documents accompanying the ban read like a reflection of the personal opinions of some senior members, and represent a gross overstep of the regulator’s mission and remit.

Ironically, this is exactly the type of unreasonable centralized control that crypto assets were created to circumvent.

Too difficult

A secondary message, also alarming, says the FCA thinks retail investors are incapable of understanding new topics.

The reasoning is couched in a “for your own good” tone – the FCA assures investors it is preventing losses of between £19 million and £101 million a year. This in itself insults retail investors’ intelligence, as whatever method they used to calculate this figure produced too wide a band to be even remotely credible. I wonder how much the same retail consumers lose on the National Lottery every year.

Let’s take a look at the five main reasons for the ban, according to the FCA bulletin.

1) First up is the “inherent nature of the underlying assets, which means they have no reliable basis for valuation.” Seriously, show me something that does in these markets. OK, that might be a slight exaggeration, but the idea that market prices respond to fair valuations went out the window months ago.

Plus, crypto assets are a new type of asset. They don’t respond to traditional valuation methods, but this does not mean they don’t have any value drivers. Plenty of work is being done to deepen and spread understanding of what these are.

2) Second, we have the “prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market (eg cyber theft).” You may recall that, at the end of September, leaked documents known as the FinCEN Files showed that the U.S. Treasury has labelled the U.K. a “higher risk jurisdiction,” because of the relatively high incidence of financial crime that has nothing to do with crypto derivatives.

3) The cited “extreme volatility in crypto asset price movements” is also an unjustified excuse. Crypto assets are volatile, but bitcoin’s volatility has been heading down over the years, and is not as volatile as some equities on which investors can buy derivatives. Yet, you don’t see U.K. retail investors being banned from buying or selling Tesla derivatives.

Source: Coin Metrics, FactSet

4) Throughout the statement, the FCA refers often to the “inadequate understanding of crypto assets by retail consumers.” This is just plain condescending. How do they know the understanding is inadequate? This assumption is tantamount to assuming retail investors are incapable of doing their own research and understanding the material. I’m certain there are many retail investors who understand crypto assets better than the FCA does.

What’s more, FCA consumer survey results released in July of this year found that “the majority of crypto asset owners are generally knowledgeable about the product, are aware of the lack of regulatory protection afforded and understand the risk of price volatility.” The FCA’s own research shows that retail crypto investors have done their homework. Deciding that homework is “inadequate” seems an inappropriate step for a financial regulator to make, especially when no justification is offered.

5) And finally, perhaps my favorite one, we have the “lack of legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products.” Is it the FCA’s job to determine what the market needs? Does the market really need more equity exchange-traded funds (ETF)? Many well-known investors, with long track records of respectability and rigor, have argued that crypto assets do fulfill a need for a hedge against inflation and financial turmoil.

Too easy

As if more evidence was needed that this is not about a lack of disclosure or oversight and more about dampening interest in a new asset type, the ban includes ETNs. This is likely to have a greater impact than the derivatives ban, as ETNs are a meaningful onramp into the crypto markets for retail investors. It is also more perplexing, as ETNs are much less risky than derivatives.

The risk profile is irrelevant, however. The FCA acknowledges that ETNs are sold with an information-packed prospectus, but even that “will not allow retail consumers to value crypto ETNs reliably.”

The FCA also acknowledges that ETNs trade on regulated exchanges. However, “retail consumers are still unable reliably to predict potential price impacts caused by issues in the underlying crypto asset markets” (as if it were easier in stock markets). This means, you guessed it, that they “cannot value them or the ETN reliably.”

And, ETNs are not leveraged. But that doesn’t matter, what is important is investors’ ability to value things correctly.

Within bounds

You’re probably wondering why the ban didn’t extend to crypto assets themselves, when it’s obviously the assets that are the problem, not the packaging.

The answer might lie in the same consumer survey mentioned above, which showed that 83% of U.K. residents that had purchased cryptocurrencies had done so through non-U.K. based exchanges. Perhaps the FCA realizes that an outright ban would be futile? Or perhaps the very same companies that finance the FCA (members of the U.K.’s financial services industry) have applied some pressure to save what could be profitable revenue streams in the future?

In banning derivatives, though, the FCA is failing in one of its principal remits. Making it harder for small investors to hedge their positions, and/or pushing investors to less regulated offshore platforms, does not sound like consumer protection. And removing the relatively safe onramps of ETNs from the range of crypto instruments available means that retail investors have to handle their own, possibly less secure, custody arrangements.

The ban is also hurting the crypto industry. Derivatives are an essential component of efficient markets. They help with price discovery by allowing expression of a variety of opinions, and they encourage liquidity by offering downside protection. Crypto derivatives are still available to institutional clients who dominate the markets, so the immediate impact is likely to be minimal. But measures like this exacerbate inequality, concentrating return opportunities in the hands of those that have financial power. Markets should not just be for the institutions.

Note that the ban extends to self-certified sophisticated investors and high-net worth individuals, on the grounds that these investors stand to lose even more. The FCA has decided that these experienced and/or wealthy individuals do not have the right to use their own money to take on financial risk of their choosing.

Doing the work

Now, fair, crypto assets are tricky to value. Many theories abound, yet no one “knows” how to do it. We have here a young market with totally different fundamental drivers, running on a technology that spins off totally different data sets that analysts across the industry are digging into.

This is one of the reasons we started our series of reports and webinars on crypto asset fundamentals, with a view to furthering the conversation about how to value crypto assets. It is also one of the most exciting aspects of our industry: the opportunity to “discover” uncharted (pun) territory in asset research, to set the bases for continuing exploration and to develop a new discipline in financial analysis.

As our knowledge evolves, valuation models will emerge, with additional insight provided by granular data unavailable to investors in traditional assets. Crypto assets will eventually be seen as a much more transparent and information-rich type of investment than stocks, say. One day we will look back and marvel at how we trusted information provided by issuing companies themselves, audited by contracted service providers, sold on platforms with hidden or hard-to-understand fees. And the emergence of crypto assets and their unusual data sets is likely to have the biggest influence on investment valuations since Graham and Dodd unleashed their security analysis framework in 1934.

Investors’ inability to fairly value crypto assets is not the problem. The FCA’s lack of foresight is.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

On Friday, bitcoin broke through $11,000 for the first time since mid-September, after a week languishing around $10,600.

Source: CoinDesk Research

This could partly reflect the weaker dollar toward the end of the week and the return of optimism to equity markets. It could also be as a result of the news that payments processor Square has purchased close to $50 million worth of BTC for its treasury – the purchase already happened, but the market seems to expect other corporations to follow suit.

Furthermore, it feels significant that the BTC price weathered several blows during the past two weeks (such as the criminal charges brought against derivatives exchange BitMEX, a notable hack on crypto exchange KuCoin and the disruption of stimulus talks in the U.S.) without notable declines.

CHAIN LINKS

Payments company Square, led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has joined the ranks of companies putting part of treasury holdings into bitcoin. This week it revealed that it has purchased 4,709 bitcoins, a $50 million investment representing 1% of the firm’s total assets. TAKEAWAY: Square has done more than put part of its treasury into bitcoin. It has also written a how-to for other firms considering doing the same. This could end up doing even more as encouragement than the publicity around the investment, as I suspect that the idea of placing corporate funds on totally different rails, using unfamiliar intermediaries and confusing custody arrangements, must be terrifying for corporate treasurers. Square even explains how the holding will be accounted for on the balance sheet, detail I haven’t seen anywhere else.

Tumbling prices for many decentralized finance tokens have eased congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, bringing fees back down to August levels. TAKEAWAY: The problem has not gone away, however – fees are still well above the levels seen in the first half of the year, and may still exert a dampening influence on network growth.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the largest U.S. regulated market for bitcoin futures, has been sounding out cryptocurrency traders to gauge their interest in a listing of ether (ETH) futures and options. TAKEAWAY: Last year, the chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commision (CFTC), Heath Tarbert, said on stage at a CoinDesk event that he expected to see ether futures in 2020. At the time, I expressed skepticism, mainly because of the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 launch. I will be happy to be proven wrong, however, as ETH futures on a regulated derivatives platform will give institutional investors more choices in framing their investment theses.

Filings for the first half of this year show Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. and two Vanguard funds purchased shares in crypto mining company Riot Blockchain. A handful of Fidelity funds invested in Riot, bitcoin mining services provider HIVE, mining company Hut 8 and Hong Kong-based digital asset platform BC Group. TAKEAWAY: This hints at a growing interest in listed companies with exposure to crypto asset markets, which can be held in a wider range of regulated funds than a direct crypto asset holding can.

Jones and his investigation into the CIA’s post 9/11 Detention and Interrogation Program. He also wrote and produced the Netflix movie The Laundromat about the Panama Papers. Burns will also co-produce Fake! with Jennifer Todd and Winslet for MGM Studios.

Winslet is a seven-time Oscar nominee who won Best Actress in 2009 for her role in The Reader. Her IMDB page shows 65 acting credits, including Titanic, Steve Jobs, the Divergent movies, The Holiday, and Sense and Sensibility. She is also teaming up with Titanic filmmaker James Cameron for Avatar 2.

Onecoin has been described as “one of the biggest scams in history,” having allegedly raked in $4 billion worldwide. The cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme is promoted by Bulgaria-based offshore companies Onecoin Ltd. and Onelife Network Ltd., both of which were founded by Ruja Ignatova in collaboration with Sebastian Greenwood. Ignatova disappeared in 2017 and is still at large while Greenwood was arrested in 2018. Ruja’s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and fraud after he was arrested in March last year.

McAdam is a victim of Onecoin’s Ponzi scheme; she founded a support group for those affected by the scam. She, her family, and friends invested and lost almost $300,000. McAdam tweeted Saturday after the news of her upcoming movie broke, thanking author and broadcaster Douglas Thompson for helping her write Fake! She described her book as “A memoir book of my life and hell of a journey for justice in Onecoin fraudulent scam which is now also going to be featured in a Hollywood MGM movie. I am absolutely thrilled. So thankful.”

The latest data from Coingecko shows that the combined trading volumes of cryptocurrency exchanges went up by $155 billion between July and September, from $175.7 billion to $330.6 billion. The new total volume represents a 88% increase which Coingecko attributes to the decentralized finance (defi) hype and yield farming frenzy that peaked in August.

In the report, Coingecko also observes that from the start of Q3, traded volumes on decentralized exchanges (dexs) grew much faster than those of centralized exchanges (cexs). For instance, in Q3, “the monthly average dex trading volumes (of top ten dexs) grew by 197%, outperforming the average volumes of the top ten cexs, which went up 35%.” Despite the explosive growth, which also appeared to slow in September, dex volumes account for just 6% of total cex volumes.

Explaining the relatively modest performance by cexs, the report observes that while the month of August proved to be the best after volumes grew by 83%, September trades ultimately reversed the previous month’s gains. According to the report, cex volumes dropped from $314.6 billion seen in August to $300 billion by end of September. The report states that Coinbase and Okex contributed 60% of the reversal.

Meanwhile, the report also provides data on the performance of individual dex platforms during the period. As the data shows, Uniswap, which contributed just under 50% of total dex volumes in July, saw its market share grow to 63% by end of September. Following Uniswap is Curve which experienced a fast-changing quarter after its share initially dropped from 24% in July to 13% in August. However, by the end of September, Curve had recovered after contributing 17% to total dex volumes.

In the meantime, Sushiswap, which forked from Uniswap on August 28, managed to account for 8% of the total volumes by the end of September. The rest of the dex protocols contributed 4% or less to the total volumes.

Next, the Coingecko report provides a timeline of key events that explain the apparent rivalry between Uniswap and Sushiswap. The report highlights that after forking, Sushiswap went on “to introduce a new token (SUSHI), distributed via liquidity mining.”

Explaining the significance of this move, the report says:

“Unlike Uniswap which shares 0.3% of trading fees to liquidity providers, Sushiswap shares 0.25% to liquidity providers with the remaining 0.05% being converted to SUSHI and distributed to SUSHI holders. Mining returns of over 2,000% drew in over $1.4 billion to Sushiswap at its peak.”

On September 18, Uniswap began liquidity mining and since then its total-value-locked (TVL) soared to over $2 billion by the end of that month. Lastly, the Coingecko report suggested that non-fungible tokens (NFT) farming are showing signs that they could be the next big thing after defi tokens.

It was the first time a nonfungible token was auctioned at one of the major auction houses for traditional art.

One of the last events, Bridge to Metaverse, presented by Snark.art, showed tokenized artworks by both established and emerging contemporary artists. A group exhibition brought leading artists of our time — the Kabakovs, Kendell Geers, AES+F, Recycle Group and others — to the blockchain space, and a series of panel discussions worked as a bridge between the traditional and blockchain-based art worlds with its own systems of distribution.

One criticism of the crypto art market has been the perceived naivety of the works. Although people were being distracted by the emergence of memes and CryptoKitties, there have also been some serious artists who have made their presence felt in the crypto world.

The traditional position of arts has been a commentary on the current state of affairs. A way to subversively criticize and, at the same time, to magnify the truth of what we are living through.

This is a perfect match with the emergence of the anonymity of blockchain technology in the new climate of being constantly tracked by our everyday gadgets.

Will the emerging artists in the new field of crypto art be influenced by traditional artists bringing their works into a shared blockchain space? With strong voices raising political, race, gender and inequality issues, their influx in these current times may create a shift in the way art is created, collected and viewed.

The traditional art market brings with it not only artists but also gallerists and curators who are naturally also drawn to growing markets. In fact, we are already seeing a move toward more classic ways of buying, with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles purchasing works from artists to exhibit them in its own permanent collection.

Of course, this will also open the door to Crypto Art Basel, Biennale and other curated events whose crypto artworks will break sales records at Christie’s or Sotheby’s.

Fifty years from now, those first NFT artworks by world-acclaimed artists could become highly valuable, just like what happened with the first animations of John Whitney, the father of computer animation, who created the first animated art on his computer back in 1960.

Serious contemporary artists mirror and even magnify the truth of our reality without censorship. In the current political world, a marriage between the established artists and crypto art with no censorship is virtually a perfect match.

Misha Libman, co-founder of Snark.art, certainly believes this is a challenge to not only take on but to relish in, and he stated that:

“While many creative industries like film, music and publishing have begun their transition into the digital realm many years ago, the inability to establish digital scarcity for art has kept the $60-billion art market largely in the physical domain. Blockchain technology does not only offer the ability to establish scarcity for digital content but also has the potential to unlock other exciting social mechanics that artists can experiment with, while reaching new global audiences directly without needing to cross physical borders and other barriers.”

Therefore, is the crypto art audience ready to be challenged with serious statements of shifting toward digitalization? Especially as established artists now find themselves with a new technological medium and a way to reach audiences they never had before.

These DeFi applications offer an increasingly large array of potential use cases for bitcoin investors looking for alternative ways to issue loans or make trades on new exchange platforms.

Tokenizing bitcoin serves as a bridge between these two leading cryptocurrency communities and an important step forward for traders and investors taking advantage of the features offered by both blockchains. Through tokenized bitcoin projects, the powerful monetary properties of bitcoin can be leveraged in the ever-growing collection of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency applications.

CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us. Today's intro is written by CoinDesk reporter Zack Voell.

Tokenized bitcoin also revives an age-old discussion on the merits of decentralization versus convenience. Some projects like Thesis’ tBTC project prioritizes decentralization while others, like the industry-leading wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) project by BitGo emphasizes convenience through a central custodian for all tokenized coins.

To date, seven different projects offer bitcoin tokenization services, and that list is likely to grow along with demand for more bitcoin-backed ERC-20 tokens. As the amount of tokenized bitcoin grows, the importance of each project’s security and reliability becomes even more important as does the continued development of Ethereum-based applications that pique the interest of tokenized bitcoin holders.

It’s a topic of conversation likely to be covered by CoinList and BitGo representatives when speaking on the virtual panel Unlocked: BTC on Eth: Having Your Cake and Eating It, Too at invest: ethereum economy this coming Wednesday.

The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit

Ethereum has delivered many mind-boggling innovations – some by design, others out of necessity. With DeFi pushing the ecosystem, existing infrastructure is being maxed out. Can Eth 2.0 address these pain points? Is this the opportunity for so-called “Eth Killers”?

MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen will assess this critical fork in the road along with representatives from NEAR Protocol and Framework Ventures at invest: ethereum economy. Tune into “The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit,” on Oct. 14 starting at 9:30 a.m. ET.

Ethereum 101

To the surprise of many, bitcoin has been a breakout star in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) moment. Taking the form of wrapped or tokenized bitcoin, the digital asset takes the best of both blockchains – bitcoin’s price value and brand along with Ethereum’s programmability – into one highly in-demand token.

CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley breaks down the mechanics behind these tokenized versions as well as the reasons investors would want to trade representations of BTC on a competing blockchain.

Why use tokenized BTC?

What bitcoin on Ethereum does is simple: It provides liquidity for growing decentralized exchanges (DEX), such as Uniswap. Bitcoin’s current market cap is five times larger than the second largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). That money can be put to use making more money.

Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks.

DeFi is considered vastly immature when compared to traditional or centralized exchange (CEX) markets. This can be seen in the large price spreads between orders on exchange books between different DeFi markets.

Price differences on markets can be exploited by traders in what is called arbitrage opportunities.

Wrapped bitcoin is often the asset of choice for investors seeking arbitrage. Bitcoin packs a large punch in terms of price value. More money on DeFi trading platforms makes the markets themselves stronger as additional buying and selling options are presented.

But tokenizing bitcoin isn’t without risks, particularly software risk. Investors who want exposure to bitcoin’s liquidity pay higher interest rates to cover the risk of losing an asset in addition to getting exposure to the first cryptocurrencies liquidity.

Security of bitcoin investments

For tokenized bitcoin, security boils down to the type of custodianship and if the investment is collateralized. Three major models exist: a centralized firm like BitGo; a smart contract system with collateral, such as tBTC; or a complete, synthetic-asset backing employed by sBTC.

BitGo’s centralized model requires users to give the custodian BTC to receive an ERC-20 token-equivalent of BTC in return. That ERC-20 can then be sold on secondary markets or plugged into a DeFi application to earn yield.

Keep Network’s tBTC, which launched last month, is similar to WBTC but replaces the centralized BitGo model with a network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts. This network aims at bringing more decentralization to BitGo’s process by allowing both parties – the bitcoin depositor and custodian – to interact trustlessly through software.

A few features make this possible, such as the bitcoin depositors being able to choose who holds their bitcoin and a 150% security bond (held in ETH) pledged by the custodians on the off-chance they run to the hills with the deposits.

Ren’s rBTC works in a similar manner to tBTC’s node network by having the Ren Virtual Machine, RenVM, act as a trustless agent between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

Lastly, sBTC is an ERC-20 version of bitcoin. But this time it’s backed by another token, the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). Each sBTC is not backed by BTC, but 800% of a BTC’s value in SNX, the token for minting synthetic assets (Syns) on the Synthetix DEX.

The future of tokenized assets

The wild success of BitGo’s WBTC and WETH (wrapped ether) may lead to more constructions of other coin holdings. Ben Chan, CTO at WBTC co-creator BitGo, told Coindesk in August that the firm was looking at wrapping other cryptocurrencies.

WBTC’s 2020 success has largely been thanks to DeFi, he said.

“What we’ve seen this year is that WBTC traction has been largely thanks to the highly composable DeFi industry,” Chan said.

The ledger

CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey took on the theme of wrapped bitcoin in his weekly newsletter, Money Reimagined, last June. According to Casey, tokenized bitcoins bring not only value and legitimacy to a burgeoning decentralized financial ecosystem, but also security.

Likewise, Ethereum provides a clear path towards returns for tokenized bitcoin users, willing to take on extra risk.

DeFi double act

Tensions between the Bitcoin and Ethereum tribes have been stirred by a trend outsiders might see as a sign of harmony. Beneath the rivalry that plays out primarily on Crypto Twitter, the bitcoin-on-Ethereum trend says more about complementarity than competition.

The growth of tokenized representations of BTC highlights that bitcoin is the crypto universe’s reserve asset and that Ethereum’s burgeoning “DeFi” ecosystem is crypto’s go-to platform for generating credit and facilitating fluid exchange.

Real-world parallels

This trend captures the early beginnings of a new, decentralized global financial system. An analogy: Bitcoin is the dollar, and Ethereum is SWIFT, the international network that coordinates cross-border payments among banks. (Since Ethereum is trying to do much more than payments, we could also cite a number of other organizations in this analogy, such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association or the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.)

So, let’s dismiss claims like those of Ethhub.io co-founder Anthony Sassano. He argued that because bitcoin token transactions on Ethereum deny miners fees they would otherwise receive on the bitcoin chain, bitcoin is becoming a “second-class citizen” to ether. You’d hardly expect people in countries where dollars are preferred to the local currency to think of the former as second class. And just as the U.S. benefits from overseas demand for dollars – via seigniorage or interest-free loans – bitcoin holders benefit from its sought-after liquidity and collateral value in the Ethereum ecosystem, where it lets them extract premium interest.

Still, to declare bitcoin the winner based on its appeal as a reserve asset is to compare apples to oranges. Ether is increasingly viewed not as a payment or store-of-value currency but for what it was intended: as a commodity that fuels the decentralized computing network orchestrating its smart contracts.

That network now sustains its financial system, a decentralized microcosm of the massive traditional one. It takes tokenized versions of the underlying currencies that users most value (whether bitcoin or fiat) and provides disintermediated mechanisms for lending or borrowing them or for creating decentralized derivative or insurance contracts. What’s emerging, albeit in a form too volatile for traditional institutions, is a multifaceted, market for managing and trading in risk.

This system is being fueled by a global innovation and development pool bigger than Bitcoin’s. As of June of last year, there were 1,243 full-time developers working on Ethereum compared with 319 working on Bitcoin Core, according to a report by Electric Capital. While that work is spread across multiple projects, the size of its community gives Ethereum the advantage of network effects.

Whether DeFi can shed its Wild West feel and mature sufficiently for mainstream adoption, the code and ideas generated by these engineers are laying the foundation for whatever regulated or unregulated blockchain-based finance models emerge in the future.

Complexity vs. simplicity

There are legitimate concerns about security on Ethereum. With such a complex system, and so many different programs running on it, the attack surface is large. And given the challenges the community faces in migrating to Ethereum 2.0, including a new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and a sharding solution for scaling transactions, it’s still not assured it will ever be ready for prime time.

Indeed, the relative lack of complexity is one reason why many feel more comfortable with Bitcoin Core’s security. Bitcoin is a one-trick pony, but it does that trick – keeping track of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs – very well and very securely. Its proven security is a key reason why bitcoin is crypto’s reserve asset.

Toward anti-fragility

The inclusion of bitcoin in Ethereum smart contracts is inherently strengthening the DeFi system.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which allow peer-to-peer crypto trading without centralized exchange (CEX) taking custody of your assets, have integrated WBTC into their markets to boost the liquidity needed to make them viable.

Meanwhile, the move by leading DeFi platform MakerDAO to include WBTC last spring in its accepted collateral has meant it has a bigger pool of value to generate loans against.

This expansion in DeFi’s user base and market offerings is in itself a boost to security. That’s not just because more developers means more code vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed. It’s because the combinations of investors’ short and long positions, and of insurance and derivative products, will ultimately get closer to Nassim Taleb’s ideal of an “antifragile” system.

That’s not to say there aren’t risks in DeFi. Many are worried that the frenzy around speculative activities such as “yield farming” and interconnected leverage could set off a systemic crisis.

If that happens, maybe Bitcoin can offer an alternative, more stable architecture for it. Either way, ideas to improve DeFi are coming all the time – whether for better system-wide data or for a more trustworthy legal framework.

Out of this hurly-burly, something transformative will emerge. Whether it’s dominated by Ethereum or spread across different blockchains, the end result will show more cross-protocol synergy than the chains’ warring communities would suggest.

At stake

Matt Luongo, founder of cryptocurrency venture production studio Thesis, wrote an op-ed discussing the similarities between “stacking sats” and decentralized finance. While hardnose bitcoiners may see DeFi as a distraction, Luongo thinks they should rethink their assertions. The article, published Oct. 1, is excerpted below.

Staking sats?

Bitcoin’s usefulness and grounding as hard money set it apart from most of the crypto froth from the past several years. The ocean of Ethereum white papers produced has yielded comparatively few working projects, and even fewer that anyone outside the crypto world would call usable.

Regardless of Bitcoin’s advantages, I am on record saying that I am a monetary maximalist, not a Bitcoin maximalist. I believe finance is a human right, just like speech and assembly, and that we need a fair and transparent financial system that empowers individuals, not powerful middlemen. So while I believe in the soundness of Bitcoin and its ability to help reshape finance, I will support any project that furthers this ultimate vision for a new economic system.

The fact that Ethereum is not Bitcoin, that it has consistently driven hype and bubbles, and that it still has not found a workable long-term solution for scalability, does not mean it offers nothing of value. In fact, Ethereum’s top DeFi platforms are doing some truly exciting and innovative work, and they have the promise to further the cause of a decentralized future of money.

MakerDAO operates like a credit facility, driving liquidity and encouraging more lending when interest rates are low. Compound, with its developer-focused interest rate protocols, enables the savings and loan functions of traditional banks. In more arcane spheres, projects like Synthetix offer a version of derivatives trading. Together, these platforms represent the germ of a new financial system.

Projects with names like $YAM and $TENDIES do not inspire confidence, I know. But dig a little into what DeFi is and does, and the foundations that have been laid, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. DeFi is very real, and it’s worth exploring and explaining.

Stacking sats is about steadily, gradually, doggedly accumulating wealth over time. And DeFi is in the same spirit when properly implemented (never a sure thing in the Ethereum community). It’s basic finance: DeFi lets people do things they already do through banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions. But done right, it offers these services in a way that’s fairer, more transparent and more rewarding. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that DeFi is an ally in achieving a vision it shares with Bitcoin: a trustless world of democratized, self-sovereign finance.

It would be myopic and self-defeating to ignore the potential of DeFi to advance a goal that is, after all, shared by all of us. It would be even more self-defeating to ignore real opportunities to put money to work, like when there’s a way for BTC holders to earn through cross-chain bridges like tBTC.

As Bitcoiners, we will always believe in the importance of sound money and in the Bitcoin blockchain as the best technology to facilitate it. There is plenty of risk in Ethereum and in DeFi. Potential investors must always do their due diligence. But I’m here to tell you that DeFi is for real. It’s a bubble, but it’s not just another bubble. And although there absolutely are “DeFi” platforms that will crash and burn, many of the concepts are sound. There are real opportunities for people to earn by putting their money to work – and where that’s true, investment and growth will follow.

Extortion claims

Local government premises in Japan have been hit by a flood of extortion attempts demanding bitcoin. According to a report by Japan Today on Monday, such threats have been received in at least 18 prefectures since July. The extortionists reportedly demand a payment in bitcoin to avoid the detonation of an explosive device in various public buildings, from schools to hospitals, though none of the Japanese victims have paid the extortionists, per Japan Today. Austria has also suffered a spate of similar bomb threats.

Compliance hire

BitMEX, the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange recently charged by U.S. authorities, has hired an industry veteran to lead its compliance efforts going forward. In a blog post Monday, the exchange’s operator 100x announced that experienced compliance officer Malcolm Wright will come aboard, reporting to the firm’s interim CEO and COO Vivien Khoo. This follows after news broke of a dual agency investigation into the firm for allegedly operating an unlicensed trading services.

Musk denies

Elon Musk has thrown doubt on a claimed sighting of a bitcoin ATM at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada. Twitter user Will Reeves claimed on Sunday that he had “just passed by and saw @elonmusk has a bitcoin ATM at the Gigafactory.” The tweet was accompanied by a Google maps image revealing the location of the ATM on the northern side of the factory complex. Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said he didn’t believe the claim was “accurate” in a tweet on Monday. Bitcoin ATM firm LibertyX confirmed with CoinDesk it has installed three “traditional ATMs” on site “so employees can use their debit cards and buy bitcoin.”

Little impact

The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s decision to ban individual investors from speculating on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to have a minimal impact, partly because the market is so small, according to analysts and industry executives who track the trading business. Some U.K.-based brokerages that had offered the crypto derivative products to retail traders could see a drop-off in revenue, though big cryptocurrency exchanges including Kraken say the impact is likely to be minimal. While U.K. individuals can still trade the actual cryptocurrencies.

Digital yuan

Chen Yulu, deputy governor of China’s central bank, said in an article at the weekend that the digital yuan project should form an “independent” and “high-quality” element of the nation’s financial infrastructure, South China Morning Post reports. Chen added that R&D for the digital yuan should proceed at a faster pace, while pilots should show the CBDC is “controllable and safeguards the security of payments.” Last week, the city of Shenzhen, together with the central bank, launched a kind of lottery allowing local residents to apply for some of 10 million digital yuan that will be handed out.

The ban is set to take effect in January. Professional investors weren’t barred from trading cryptocurrency derivatives partly because they “have greater understanding of the risks and greater capacity to absorb potential investment losses,” according to an FCA report this month.

“Those still keen on trading crypto derivatives will just find ways to open accounts in unaffected regions,” Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, told CoinDesk in an email. “There is a stark risk that retail traders will simply trade on unregulated exchanges, which in fact puts them at more risk.”

Among those affected, the proposal does appear to be quite unpopular: The FCA report indicated that some 97% of comments submitted in connection with the rulemaking were opposed to agency’s proposed ban.

CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson argued in her weekly Crypto Long & Short newsletter that the agency overstepped, since its “job includes protecting investors, not passing judgment on new asset groups.” One of the agency’s reasons for the ban was the “extreme volatility” in cryptocurrency prices, but bitcoin is far less volatile than many stocks, including Tesla.

Bitcoin is struggling to extend the preceding week’s 6.6% gain, the biggest percentage rise since the last week of July.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red near $11,250, having printed highs near $11,500 over the weekend.

The decline could be short-lived, as the global equity markets are trading in the green despite the resurgence of the coronavirus concerns across Europe.

Besides, the bitcoin market looks strong – the cryptocurrency rallied last week even though miners ran down inventory by 1,000 BTC by selling more than they mined, according to the MRI figure provided by data source Bytetree.com.

The miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, which tracks the changes in miners’ inventory levels, held well above 100% last week, as those responsible for generating coins boosted supply. The five- and 12-week MRIs are also holding above 100%.

In other words, the buying pressure has been strong enough to absorb extra supplies from those responsible for generating the cryptocurrencies. That’s a bullish sign.

Also, the payment company Square’s recent disclosure of their bitcoin investments has given market players a fresh shot of confidence, and technical bias has turned bullish with the cryptocurrency’s weekly close above $11,200.

As per charts, resistances are located at $11,500 and $12,000. On the downside, support is seen at $11,000, which, if breached, could cause some short-term technical traders to exit the market.

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Tweet of the Day",2020-10-12 12:38:09+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/80539/kate-winslet-onecoin-movie-fake,"Kate Winslet, the Titanic actress and an Oscar winner, is set to star in and produce ""Fake!"" — a movie about cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme OneCoin.

Deadline reported the news on Friday, saying that the movie will be written and directed by Scott Z. Burns, who has worked on films such as The Report, a political thriller, and Contagion, a pandemic movie that also starred Winslet.

Fake! is based on the forthcoming book of the same name by Douglas Thompson and Jen McAdam, a victim of the OneCoin scheme. McAdam will executive produce the film.

Movie studio MGM has acquired rights for Fake! for producer Jennifer Todd. Her filmography includes movies such as Alice In Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Across the Universe, and Memento, among others.

The OneCoin scheme was launched in 2014 and was promoted as a bitcoin rival by founder Ruja Ignatova. In March 2019, the U.S. Justice Department charged Ignatova and the other leaders behind the scheme with wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. OneCoin raised an estimated $4 billion worldwide before the scam was shut down in 2017. Ignatova disappeared at the time and hasn't been seen since.

A TV series about OneCoin and Ignatova, based on the BBC podcast ""The Missing Cryptoqueen,"" is also in development.",,https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-wallet-users-can-now-purchase-crypto-inside-the-app,"For Coinbase users who don’t want to keep their funds on an exchange, the buying and storing crypto just became a lot easier.

On Monday afternoon, the company announced Coinbase Wallet users would now have a fiat on-ramp within the wallet itself.

Previously, users holding their crypto in the self-custodial wallet would have to buy crypto on the Coinbase app (or elsewhere) and then send funds to Coinbase Wallet. This meant people trying to use, say, a DeFi protocol would have to install two separate apps to get started.

Now users can buy crypto from within Coinbase Wallet without directly touching the Coinbase.com exchange. Users will now see a “buy or transfer” option on their Wallet home screen:

New functionality in Coinbase Wallet (Coinbase)

“Wallet allows users in every part of the world to store their own crypto and use popular dapps like Compound and Uniswap,” Coinbase wrote in a blog post. “However, until now, anyone new to crypto had to buy their first cryptocurrency from an exchange, and then transfer it over manually to their Wallet apps.”

Bitcoin’s rise towards the $11,500 level over the weekend has created a notable price gap on the BTC CME futures chart, leaving the possibility of a pullback in early-week trading to fill the gap.

CME Gaps Point to Bitcoin Retracement

CME gaps appear when the traditional market closes, but Bitcoin continues to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges. When the market reopens on the CME either the following day or after the weekend, the CME starts trading on the market’s current prices.

Thus, a void in a price range is created due to an imbalance in price delivery. This void can be seen where the price either opens higher or lower than the previous candle’s close.

Looking at the CME four-hour chart of Bitcoin below, traders can see a clear market gap between the close of Friday night and the opening price of Monday morning.

BTC’s price closed at $11,098 and opened at $11,360, leaving a $262 void.

Bitcoin CME gaps have a history of eventually being filled. This means that experienced traders are actively betting on BTC to fill these gaps. On Oct. 9, a gap formed between $11,098 and $11,360, which can draw prices to trade back into this fair value price range.

Looking closely at the chart below, one can see another small Bitcoin CME gap formed on the same day. This gap is between $10,098 and $11,025.

We can hypothesize that speculative traders may use this as a trading strategy by looking to sell Bitcoin, anticipating a price correction filling up these CME gaps (fair value gaps) since the price has been unable to break the $11,500 resistance zone.

With these two pieces of information, one can assume that some speculative traders may be building a strategy around the filling of these CME gaps. In practice, this could mean selling now in expectation of a retracement to each of the above-mentioned gaps.

Since Bitcoin has exhibited serious bullish momentum above $11,000 over recent days and is technically bullish, some traders may also attempt to buy into this current CME futures gap, as the bullish momentum could well hold in the medium term.

For experienced investors, gaps are seen as high probability setups and may present medium-term to long-term swing trades, with excellent risk to reward ratios.

",,https://www.zdnet.com/article/bitcoin-wallet-trick-has-netted-criminals-more-than-22-million/,"A simple technique has helped cybercrime gangs steal more than $22 million in user funds from users of the Electrum wallet app; a ZDNet investigation has discovered.

This particular technique was first seen in December 2018. Since then, the attack pattern has been reused in multiple campaigns over the past two years.

ZDNet has tracked down multiple Bitcoin accounts where criminals have gathered stolen funds from attacks they carried out over the course of 2019 and 2020, with some attacks taking place as recently as last month, in September 2020.

Reports from victims submitted to Bitcoin abuse portals reveal the same story.

Users of the Electrum Bitcoin wallet app received an unexpected update request via a popup message, they updated their wallet, and funds were immediately stolen and sent to an attacker's Bitcoin account.

Looking at how cybercriminals are stealing funds, this technique works because of the inner workings of the Electrum wallet app and its backend infrastructure.

To process any transactions, Electrum wallets are designed to connect to the Bitcoin blockchain through a network of Electrum servers — known as ElectrumX.

However, while some wallet applications control who can manage these servers, things are different in Electrum's open ecosystem, where everyone can set up an ElectrumX gateway server.

Since 2018, cybercrime gangs have been abusing this loophole to spin up malicious servers and wait for users to randomly connect to their systems.

When this happens, the attackers instruct the server to show a popup on the user's screen, instructing the user to access an URL and download and install an Electrum wallet app update.

Usually, this update download link is not for the official Electrum website, located at electrum.org, but to lookalike domains or GitHub repositories.

If users don't pay attention to the URL, they eventually end up installing a malicious version of the Electrum wallet, which the next time the user tries to use will ask for a one-time passcode (OTP).

Normally, these codes are only requested before sending funds, and not at the Electrum wallet's startup. If users enter the requested code —and most do, thinking they are using the official wallet— they effectively give official approval for the malicious wallet to transfer all of their funds to an attacker's account.

Since December 2018, users have reported around ten Bitcoin accounts being used in what's currently known as the ""fake Electrum update scam.""

These wallets currently hold 1980 bitcoin, which is roughly just over $22 million in current currency. Taking into account the 202 bitcoin stolen in our original December 2018 report, this brings the total to more than $24.6 million stolen with one simple technique.

However, it must be said that a large chunk of these funds appear to have been stolen in one single incident in August, when a user reported losing 1,400 bitcoin (~$15.8 million) after updating an Electrum wallet.

Since this technique was first seen in late 2018, the Electrum team has taken several steps to mitigate this attack.

They first implemented a server blacklisting system on Electrum X servers to block malicious additions to their networks, and they also added an update preventing servers from showing HTML formatted popups to end users.

Nevertheless, a malicious server usually slips through the cracks here and there, and the attack still works very well for Bitcoin users still using older versions of the Electrum wallet app to manage funds.",,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/blockchain-and-crypto-initiatives-58183/,"Crypto Initiatives Launched by Foreign Banks, Exchanges, Apps, Gaming Firms

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

According to a press release this week, the “Bank of Thailand (BOT) … has successfully launched the world’s first blockchain-based platform for government savings bonds issuing a total of $1.6B USD within two weeks.” According to the press release, the blockchain platform reduced the “operational complexity” and cost of issuing the bonds and reduced “a process that previously took 15 days to two days.”

According to another recent press release, a group of 14 banks has launched an initiative to create a “digital trade finance registry” to “improve transparency in commodity trade” and “serve as a secure central database for the banking industry to access records of trade transactions financed across banks in Singapore.” The press release notes that the project will be developed “on a blockchain network supported by technology provider dltledgers.”

In Japan, an affiliate business of LINE, the popular Japanese messaging app, announced plans to launch a service that will allow LINE users to lend their cryptocurrencies to BITMAX, a licensed Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that is also affiliated with LINE. Users of the service will reportedly receive a “rental fee” that is similar to interest on a traditional loan.

Late last week, the foreign affiliate of a major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange announced that it has received “a full Class F Digital Assets Business Act license to operate its acclaimed cryptocurrency exchange under the supervision of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).” Also late last week, a major video game publisher based in France announced the forthcoming public sale of its blockchain-based token, ATRI, which is scheduled to take place on Nov. 20 in partnership with a major cryptocurrency exchange.

New Guidance on Ransomware, Crypto Derivatives; Crypto Tax Report Published

By: Teresa Goody Guillén

On Oct. 1, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued two advisories intended to assist U.S. individuals and businesses in combating ransomware. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued an advisory to highlight the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments—a large portion of which are paid in bitcoin. The OFAC advisory reinforces that the U.S. government disfavors payments of ransom, but there is no general ban; payments to sanctioned individuals and/or entities can result in significant penalties; applications for licenses to make payments to sanctioned individuals and/or entities are considered with a presumption of denial; and cooperating with law enforcement is essential. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued the other advisory, which is intended to alert financial institutions to predominant trends, typologies, and potential “red flag” indicators of ransomware and associated money laundering activities.

In the UK, this week the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published final rules banning the sale, marketing and distribution to all retail consumers of any derivatives (i.e., contracts for difference, options and futures) and exchange traded notes that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets by firms acting in, or from, the UK. According to the press release, “unregulated transferable cryptoassets are tokens that are not ‘specified investments’ or e-money, and can be traded, which includes well-known tokens such as Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple.” The FCA cited several risk factors of these products, including the lack of a reliable basis for valuation; the prevalence of market abuse and crime; extreme volatility; and a lack of understanding and legitimate investment need on the part of retail consumers.

A Big Four accounting and consulting firm has released its Annual Global Crypto Tax Report 2020, which aims to evaluate and review the existing digital assets tax guidance globally and identify gaps or where guidance may need to be refined or supplemented. The report notes that the guidance issued thus far largely focuses on how to apply existing tax laws or policies to transactions, situations and structures that are unique to digital assets, instead of passing new legislation. The report includes an appendix that contains the latest global crypto tax developments, along with crypto tax information for 29 jurisdictions.

DOJ Charges Allege Crypto Tax Evasion, Interpol Cites Crypto Privacy Threats

By: Jordan R. Silversmith

John McAfee, an English American computer programmer and businessman, was arrested this week on charges of tax evasion and failure to file tax returns. According to a press release, McAfee “evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.” The Department of Justice unsealed its indictment following McAfee’s arrest in Spain, where he faces extradition. This comes on the same day that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against McAfee for allegedly promoting several initial coin offerings (ICOs) without disclosing that ICO issuers were paying him to do so, in violation of federal securities laws. McAfee faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum sentence of one year in prison on each count of willful failure to file a tax return. He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution and fines.

A report released by Interpol this week named privacy wallets, privacy coins and other cryptocurrency items as “top threats” in its Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment. According to the report, “privacy-enhanced wallet services using coinjoin concepts (for example, Wasabi and Samurai [sic] wallets) have emerged as a top threat in addition to well established centralized mixers.”

This week the Travel Rule Protocol (TRP), a 25-member working group favored by banks and traditional financial institutions, released the first version of its application programming interface (API). The group aims for the product to offer a clear and straightforward way for organizations to trade identification data about cryptocurrency transaction originators and beneficiaries, as required by recent guidance from the Financial Action Task Force.
