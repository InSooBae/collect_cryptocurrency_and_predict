Spain’s government has reportedly approved a bill that requires cryptocurrency owners to disclose their crypto holdings and any gains on their assets.

Spain’s Finance Minister and the government’s spokesperson, Maria Jesus Montero, said at a press conference following the weekly cabinet meeting that this bill is part of broader legislation to crack down on tax fraud, several Spanish news outlets have reported. The bill was sent to the Spanish Congress of Deputies on Tuesday and will now go to parliament for discussion and final approval.

“This is a bill that will add to the work already being carried out by tax authorities,” Montero explained but did not go into detail about how the rules will be enforced. It is one of the latest efforts by the government to raise tax revenue amid a severe coronavirus pandemic-driven economic crisis.

The bill, entitled “Law on preventive measures to combat tax avoidance,” seeks greater control over cryptocurrencies, Criptonoticias publication described, noting that the government intends to “oblige citizens to provide detailed information on balances and transactions carried out inside and outside of Spain.” If approved, crypto activities that must be reported to the authorities include “acquisition, transmission, exchange, transfer, collections and payments,” the news outlet conveyed.

The Spanish tax authority, the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (AEAT), began sending out tax notices in April to remind cryptocurrency owners of their tax obligations.

According to Global Legal Insights, capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies by a resident of Spain are taxed between 19% and 23%. The higher rate applies to gains in excess of €50,000 ($58,666). The exchange between cryptocurrencies and euros is VAT-exempt.

Meanwhile, all 350 Spanish deputies were sent bitcoin last week as part of an educational campaign by blockchain platform Tutellus and Observatorio Blockchain. This initiative is similar to the Crypto for Congress campaign that recently sent bitcoin to all Members of Congress in the U.S.

This has made trading in cryptocurrencies considerably easier. You may choose to trade traditional Forex currency pairs or cryptocurrencies after opening an account with many major brokers – or both!

Since the cryptocurrency boom of the late 2010s, many traditional Forex / CFD brokers have begun to offer trading in the most major liquid cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether and Ripple.

What is Forex?

Forex stands for foreign exchange and it is a global market of exchange between national currencies, with the highest trading volume and liquidity. Every day transactions are concluded worth a total of approximately $6.6 trillion, made up of over 150 government-backed national currencies.

When the exchange rate of two currencies quoted against is other is given, it is called a currency pair or cross. When the biggest currencies by volume are quoted against each other – all involving the U.S. Dollar – they are called “currency pairs”. Pairings not involving the U.S. Dollar are called “currency crosses”. The most important currencies, i.e. those with the greatest trading volumes, are the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, and the British Pound.

Usually, Forex pairs are offered for trading as contracts for differences (CFDs). This means that you don’t actually buy legal ownership of any currencies when you make a trade, you just agree to make profit or loss by a defined amount according to the movement of the broker’s price feed. Even where brokers offer Forex trades as “spot” and not CFDs, there is almost always a legal mechanism in place to stop you ever having to take delivery of any amount of actual currency.

Pros and Cons of Forex

The Forex market is highly sensitive to global events which makes foreign currency exchange rates very susceptible to economic data releases, central bank policy changes, and macroeconomic and political events.

Forex as an asset class has relatively low volatility. This is because Forex assets are fiat currencies managed by central banks, and these banks can expand or reduce supplies of their respective currencies as they wish, giving them the ability to turn both demand and supply on or off. As central banks generally strive for relatively stable exchange rates for their currencies, Forex tends to be a relatively stable mean-reverting market most of the time, although persistent trends do of course happen, especially in the biggest currencies such as the U.S. Dollar and the Euro.

The cost of trading Forex is relatively low. For example, retail Forex traders typically pay a spread and/or commission of approximately 1 pip on a round trip trade in the benchmark EUR/USD currency pair, which represents a cost of approximately 0.08% of the value of the asset traded. The costs of trading or investing in cryptocurrencies tends to be considerably higher.

As price movements in Forex tend to be relatively calm with low volatility, regulators tend to allow retail Forex brokers to offer high leverage in Forex currency pairs – as much as 30 to 1 even in highly regulated jurisdictions. This means that if you trade Forex, you can usually buy and sell much more Forex than the actual money you have deposited in your account, although it is not generally a good idea to be very highly leveraged.

The retail Forex market is generally open from Monday morning in the far east until Friday night in the U.S.A. Essentially, it is open for business 24 hours per day, 5 days per week – and there are even a few brokers beginning to offer trading over the weekends, too.

There are three major Forex market sessions: American, European, and Asian, which occur during the usual business hours of these geographic areas. The sessions are dominated by New York, Tokyo, and London as the most important global financial hubs. Broadly speaking, the Forex market is most active and best traded during the London / New York session overlap, from approximately 9am to Noon New York time.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, which have been created by private individuals, groups, and in some cases banks and other companies. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender which means they are not readily exchangeable for goods and services in the way that national currencies are, but one day they may be – there are already many business which accept the larger cryptocurrencies as payment.

If you buy and sell cryptocurrencies in the real market, your transactions are made through a decentralized and encrypted system, which goes a long way towards ensuring anonymity.

Transactions in cryptocurrencies are enacted through blockchain technology, which also regulates a finite supply and the integrity of its ecosystem, ensuring that it cannot be debased.

The cryptocurrency market had in 2020 an average daily trading volume of approximately $4.1billion, making it about two-thirds as large as the Forex market. The first digital currency was Bitcoin, launched in 2009. Bitcoin is by far the largest and most famous cryptocurrency. In October 2020, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was estimated at $204 billion, and the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies at $350 billion.

There are two ways to trade or invest in cryptocurrencies. If you want to buy real cryptocurrencies and hold the legal ownership, you can do this through major cryptocurrency exchanges. There is typically some kind of fee for ensuring security of the custodianship plus a commission, but this can be the most effective way to make a long-term investment. On the other hand, you can trade cryptocurrencies with most major Forex / CFD brokers today packaged as contracts for differences (CFDs) and as ownership is virtual – you are just betting on price fluctuations here – you do not have to worry about security and storage and any such associated fees. However, retail brokers apply overnight financing charges / swaps which mean in effect that you pay a fee for every day you keep a crypto trade open, which is why this route is better for short-term trading than long-term investing.

Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrencies

If you are buying and holding the legal ownership of cryptocurrencies, you will have security and storage issues which will impose a cost.

I mentioned earlier that major Forex currency pairs can be traded at a cost of only about 0.08% of the value of the asset traded. It is relatively considerably more expensive to trade cryptocurrencies. For example, the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin typically has a spread/commission structure of about 0.40% of the asset traded, about 5 times the cost of trading EUR/USD. This can make profitable short-term trading in cryptocurrency more challenging to execute in cryptocurrency than in Forex.

Cryptocurrencies, with the possible exception of Bitcoin, are much smaller in capitalization than the national currencies which are traded in Forex. They are more sensitive to micro issues that affect their own markets such as their integrity, adaptability, and popularity. In a sense, it is widely believed that in the end there will be a few successful cryptocurrencies which become widely used, so the value of the smaller cryptocurrencies will tend to rise or fall depending upon how their chances of becoming a “successful” cryptocurrency are seen.

Cryptocurrencies have, in recent years, been far more volatile than Forex currency pairs or crosses. Over a year, a cryptocurrency might rise in value tenfold – 1,000% - while a major Forex currency pair might typically fluctuate by 10% over a similar period of time. Forex currencies have central banks and national governments managing them, while cryptocurrencies really have nothing but market forces acting on them, meaning they are far more likely to fluctuate wildly in price. This means that large amounts of money can be made by trading or investing in them, but risk levels are much higher. Cryptocurrencies are also far less liquid than most national fiat currencies.

Due to their relatively high risk and volatility, most brokers offer trading in cryptocurrencies at very low rates of maximum leverage – typically 2 to 1 in more tightly regulated jurisdictions.

Unlike Forex, crypto markets tend to be open at weekends, meaning you can trade them on Saturdays and Sundays. You cannot do this with Forex with most brokers.

Finally, note that although more and more brokers are offering cryptocurrencies, typically only the larger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Ripple are commonly available.

Is trading crypto profitable?

Trading cryptos is risky, just like trading Forex. It is important to find a trustworthy broker, study how to trade, and be on top of the market in order to trade with knowledge.",,https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/23669-will-the-pacific-dawn-become-a-crypto-cruise-ship.html,"The former Pacific Dawn from P&O Australia may become a cryptocurrency haven in Panama as Ocean Builders may be planning to turn the 1991-built vessel into a floating community with shops and restaurants that accept bitcoins (as well as more conventional currencies).

The information on the Ocean Builders website reveals that the ship will be called “Satoshi” (after the smallest unit of a bitcoin) and the project – “Crypto Cruise Ship.”

The cabins will be sold to both bitcoin and non-bitcoin enthusiasts starting from November 5.

The Chief Operation Officer of Ocean Builders, Chad Elwartowski, told Cruise Industry News that they will be “upgrading and doing any repairs needed” on the ship once they close the sale.

Whether the ship that will be used in the project is P&O Australia’s Pacific Dawn is contractually a secret (as are other parts of the deal), said Elwartowski, but some pictures of the ship and deck plan are identical with those of the Pacific Dawn.

The parameters and amenities listed atop of the project presentation roughly match those of the Pacific Dawn, too.

“I could neither confirm nor deny this contractually (whether it’s the Pacific Dawn).),” Elwartowski said. “I’ll leave it to other people to make that determination … I guess once people see real pictures of it, it’ll be easier to figure out.”

Elwartowski is known in the public sphere for trying to live on the ocean, 14 nautical miles away from Thailand’s coast in 2019 – and for that being legally threatened by the country’s government. He and his then-girlfriend (now wife) have since left the country and relocated to Panama.

He said he has moved on from that traumatic experience.

“As far as we know, [Thailand authorities have] moved on from this. We certainly have. There was never a case opened on us, we were never charged with anything. I think that’s pretty much all over now, we’re definitely not worried about that,” Elwartowski told Cruise Industry News.

According to the information online, “Crypto Cruise Ship’s” cabins are being sold for $25,000 to $50,000. A total of 777 cabins will be available for sale.

While the price Ocean Builders paid for the ship is classified, Elwartowski revealed to Cruise Industry News that it’s much less than what it would have cost in 2019.

“The pandemic has brought prices down. I think the value of the ship last year was 100 million, and we didn’t pay that much,” he said.

The ship is expected to make its way from Greece to Panama in December.

How is Elwartowski going to make sure he doesn’t get into legal trouble this time?

He said that the Panamanian authorities are friendlier (than Thai), and he’s got a team of maritime lawyers and Columbia Cruise Services helping Ocean Builders stay within the legal framework.

“We are definitely going to be fully compliant with the laws,” he said. “Panama is more welcoming to our projects and boosting the economy than Thailand was.”

Elwartowski has also allegedly managed to bag a friendly relationship with the Panamanian government.

“We’re in contact with the government to ensure [that] anything that they see that we’re doing wrong, they can contact us [with] immediately,” he explained.

However, it seems like the company has not gotten the green flag for the Crypto Cruise Ship project yet.

“We’re still talking to [the Panama authorities] about the cruise ship, we’ve been talking to them for a year … We still don’t have a response to that. But Panama is very ship friendly… So hopefully they’re going to be as excited about it as we are,” Elwartowski said.

Explaining why the company chose Panama for this project, Elwartowski said: “Cryptocurrency is completely legal in Panama, they don’t have a central bank …They have balboas, but everybody uses dollars here, so there’s definitely no laws about using their currency.”",2020-10-13 11:36:31+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-12k-price-gains,"Disclosure

All rights reserved.",,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/13/2107969/0/en/TrustSwap-Makes-Crypto-Swaps-and-Escrow-Services-Simple-Fast-and-Cheap.html,"Alberta, Canada, Oct. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ever since Bitcoin took off in 2008, everyone from market experts to technologists has expected cryptocurrencies to assume an ever-larger role in the global financial market. One of the main reasons for those great expectations is the blockchain – the distributed ledger technology that powers Bitcoin and its siblings. Then, in 2015, the launch of Ethereum sent those predictions into overdrive.

It happened because Ethereum's blockchain carried several advances over previous iterations, and allowed for smart contracts to perform a variety of new functions within the network. That functionality has keyed the rise of DeFi – or distributed finance – which is now the hottest area of crypto development by far.

But it hasn't been a smooth path to growth. That's because the DeFi space has lacked some significant infrastructure and building blocks to facilitate many of the kinds of transactions that can animate the market. One of those deficiencies lay in a lack of options for businesses requiring peer-to-peer and time-locked transactions on the blockchain – but that's about to come to an end.

Those are the types of transactions that a new DeFi platform, known as TrustSwap, aims to facilitate. It's built from the ground up as a crypto-solution for escrow services, timed payments, and OTC currency swaps. For the first time, crypto developers and investors will be able to execute such transactions via a single fast, simple, and inexpensive platform.

According to CEO and founder Jeff Kirdeikis, the idea for TrustSwap came when he was working on an earlier crypto project that found itself in need of a way to distribute a pool of tokens to venture capital investors over a fixed length of time. It turned out that the only way to make it happen was to pay a hefty fee to a lawyer to execute the payment schedule – there was no existing smart contract solution that could handle that seemingly simple task.

He remarked at the time, ""I figured there had to be something already created that implemented this service in a smart-contract, for a fraction of the cost. There wasn't. In fact, there was nothing that allowed for time-based payments at all. No trustless escrow for institutions, no trustless team-token lockups, no automated employee payments... nothing."" That's when he decided to do something to fix that glaring deficiency in the market, and TrustSwap was born.

Today, that vision has grown into a maturing set of smart contract tools that are customizable for many general-purpose use cases. The first is TS SmartLock™, a system that provides a crypto option for time or event-based cryptocurrency transactions. It can handle both one-to-one and one-to-many transactions, making it ideal for any time a conditional or repeating crypto transaction is needed. It's so flexible, it can even serve as a payroll service for small businesses in lieu of using a payroll processing firm and costly accounting software.

The second service TrustSwap offers is meant to facilitate peer-to-peer currency swap agreements via a smart contract-based escrow arrangement. The TS SmartSwap™ service makes it possible for users to transfer millions of dollars in assets between parties in a secure, trusted manner, without the high costs that come with the traditional middlemen now used to handle such transactions. And because all parties must agree to the transfer terms before a transaction can happen, neither party ever has to worry about the other side failing to do what they've promised. When all conditions are met, the service moves the funds, with no outside intervention required.

Then there's TS SmartSubscription™, which has the potential to become the most popular and useful feature in the TrustSwap arsenal. Imagine if you could pay for any subscription using cryptocurrencies, such as your favorite streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, or could contribute in crypto to the content creators you love on Patreon. That's what TS SmartSubscription™ aims to make possible – and it does so without the need for an expensive payment processing service. Of all of TrustSwap's best-in-class features, none have as much potential to disrupt the status quo for more people than this.

But TrustSwap doesn't ignore the crypto startup community either. It's also readying two services aimed at making many common crypto-project launch tasks simple and inexpensive. The first, known as TS SmartLaunch™, is a one-stop-shop solution for token presales and other launch-related events. And the second, TS SmartWrap™, allows for the wrapping of any non-Ethereum based assets so that they can interact on the Ethereum blockchain. That means creators can incorporate offline assets or tokens from other chains in their smart contracts, opening up a whole new world of possibilities for development.

And amazingly, these features are just the beginning. TrustSwap has plans to continue to build on their initial feature set, and to partner with other DeFi standouts to bring even more innovation to the market. Their goal is nothing less than to become the foundation for a whole new era of DeFi development, and given their strong start, there's no doubt that they'll get there in short order.

About TrustSwap

TrustSwap is a DeFi platform built to facilitate a variety of common and useful transaction types on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging smart contract technology, it can outperform existing options at a fraction of current costs. The team behind it is an all-star mix of standouts from the world of crypto and mainstream business, with alumni of CoinMarketCap, Hewlett Packard, and Goldman Sachs serving in key advisory roles. Together they're building a new future for the burgeoning DeFi market, one service at a time.

JV’s founder and CEO, Don Friedman, who’s also co-founder of Inside ETFs, has become the council’s president.

The acquisition establishes the council as the “go-to” source for financial advisors interested in learning about blockchain and digital assets such as Bitcoin, according to Edelman, who’s also the founder of Edelman Financial Engines.

Before forming JVEG, Friedman co-founded Inside ETFs, the world’s largest ETF conference.

“It’s clear that blockchain and digital assets are not going away,” Edelman told ThinkAdvisor on Tuesday in an interview. “They are fast becoming mainstream, both in commerce and in the financial markets. As a result, financial advisors need to begin to understand how to incorporate these new asset classes into client portfolios.”

The company has also launched a new website and plans to hold its first virtual conference, RIADAC Vision, on March 4, 2021.

Edelman said RIADAC will also launch a certification program in the first quarter. “We’ve given presentations to thousands of financial advisors over the past several years” regarding cryptocurrency, “and we’re about to dramatically increase our activities” with the new events and certification program.

“My role is to really run the day-to-day business as well as have an eye on what the plans will be moving forward,” Friedman said in the interview.

Despite the initial breakout above two key resistance levels at $11,300 and $11,500, BTC recorded several rejections. While it might be premature to predict a marketwide correction, the level of uncertainty in the market seems to be rising.

In the short term, traders pinpoint the $11,200 to $11,325 range as a critical support area. If that region holds, technical analysts believe a significant price drop is unlikely. But if Bitcoin demonstrates weakening momentum below $11,300, the market would likely become vulnerable. Although the technical momentum of BTC has been declining, traders generally see a bigger support range from $10,600 to $10,900.

Considering the array of positive events that buoyed the price of Bitcoin in recent weeks, a near-term pullback could be healthy. On Oct. 8, Square announced that it purchased $50 million worth of BTC, reportedly 1% of its assets. Then, on Oct. 13, it was reported that Stone Ridge, the $10 billion asset manager, invested $115 million in Bitcoin. The market sentiment is highly optimistic as a result, and a sell-off to neutralize market sentiment could be positive.

Traders expect a consolidation period

Cryptocurrency traders and technical analysts are cautious in the short term, but not bearish enough to predict a clear top. Bitcoin has been ranging below $11,500, but it has also risen 5% month-to-date from $10,800. At the monthly peak, BTC recorded an 8% gain, which is relatively high considering the short period. As such, while the momentum of Bitcoin has dropped off in the past 36 hours, it is difficult to forecast a major pullback.

Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, sees a healthy ongoing trend in the broader cryptocurrency market. The trader pinpointed that BTC could see a drop to the $10,600 to $10,900 support range, but the combined market cap of cryptocurrencies is clearly on track for an extended upwards rally, he said, adding: “Very healthy construction going on here. A higher-high made after a higher low was created. Just another range-bound period before breakout above $400 billion. The next target zones are $500 and $600 after that. But very healthy upwards trend.”

Edward Morra, a Bitcoin technical analyst, cited three reasons for a pullback to the $11,100 level, noting that BTC hit an important “daily supply” level when it rallied to $11,700. This means there was significant liquidity, which was also a heavy resistance level. Morra also said the 0.705 Fibonacci resistance and the “R1 weekly pivot” make a drop to $11,100 more likely in the near term.

A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack,” who accurately predicted the $3,600 bottom in March 2020, believes that while the current trend is not bearish, it’s not primed for a continuation either. BTC rejected the $11,500 to $11,700 range and has been trading under $11,400. He said that he would likely add to his positions once an upward price movement becomes more probable. The trader added: “Been reducing some on bounces — not too convinced after the two rejections on the two lines above price. Will add again as continuation becomes more likely.”

Although traders seemingly foresee a minor price drop in the short term, many analysts are refraining from anticipating a full-blown bearish rejection. The cautious stance of most traders is likely the result of two factors that have been consistently emphasized by analysts since September: BTC’s strong 15.5% recovery within merely 19 days and little resistance above $13,000.

Resistance above $13,000

Technically, there is no strong resistance between $13,000 and $16,500. Because Bitcoin’s upswing in December 2017 was so quick and strong, it did not leave many levels that could act as resistance. Hence, if BTC surpasses $13,000 and consolidates above, it would raise the probability of a retest of $16,500, and possibly the record high at $20,000. Whether that would happen in the medium term by the end of 2021 remains unclear.

“Byzantine General,” a pseudonymous trader, said $12,000 is a critical level. A rapid upsurge above the $12,000 to $13,000 range could leave BTC en route to $16,500 and ultimately to its all-time high. The analyst said: “Volume profile based on on-chain analysis. 12K is such an important level. It’s pretty much the only resistance left. After that it’s clear skies with only a minor speed bump at 16.5K.”

Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest — which manages over $11 billion in assets under management — also pinpointed the $13,000 level as the most important technical level for Bitcoin. As previously reported, Wood said that “in technical terms,” there is little resistance between $13,000 and $20,000. It remains unclear whether BTC can regain the momentum for a rally above $13,000 in the short term, leaving traders cautious in the near term but not strongly bearish.

Variables to sustain the momentum

Various on-chain indicators and fundamental factors, such as HODLer growth, hash rate and Bitcoin exchange reserves indicate a strong uptrend. On top of that, according to data from Santiment, developer activity of the Bitcoin blockchain protocol has continuously increased: “BTC Github submission rate by its team of developers has been spiking to all-time high levels in October. This is a great sign that Bitcoin’s team continues to strive toward higher efficiency and performance going forward.”

There is a possibility that the optimistic fundamental and favorable macro factors could offset any technical weakness in the short term. For alternative assets and stores of value, like Bitcoin and gold, inflation and negative interest rates are considered persistent catalysts. The United States Federal Reserve has emphasized its stance on retaining low interest rates for years to come to offset the pandemic’s effect on the economy. Recent reports indicate that other central banks might follow suit, including the Bank of England as it’s deputy governor Sam Woods issued a letter, requesting a public consultation, that reads:

“We are requesting specific information about your firm's current readiness to deal with a zero Bank Rate, a negative Bank Rate, or a tiered system of reserves remuneration – and the steps that you would need to take to prepare for the implementation of these.”

In the medium term, the combination of positive on-chain data points and the uncertainty surrounding interest rates could continue to fuel Bitcoin, gold, and other safe-haven assets. That could coincide with the post-halving cycle of Bitcoin as it enters 2021, which historically caused BTC to rally to new record highs. This time, the market is buoyed by the entrance of institutional investors as evidenced by the high volume of institution-tailored platforms.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/10/167944-ethereum-eth-transaction-fees-keep-falling-after-major-defi-related-ecosystem-growth-bitcoin-btc-tx-fees-surge-report/,"Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, has again surged past the $11,000 mark as US stimulus talks begin and institutions start to allocate more funds to the leading digital asset.

As noted by the OKCoin team, Bitcoin has managed to break out this past week, after several weeks of consolidation within a fairly tight $1,000 trading range. The exchange confirmed that Bitcoin broke out this past week in a rally that led to BTC reaching a recent high of $11,725 (after starting from around $10,400).

The OKCoin team added that after six days of consistent gains, Bitcoin has retraced a bit, and it’s now trading at around $11,425 (at the time of writing).

The exchange further noted:

“Bitcoin pushed $1,000 higher over the past week after President Trump ended the moratorium on fiscal stimulus discussions. Another fundamental tailwind that buoyed bitcoin was institutions continuing to enter the cryptocurrency space.”

It added:

“Coin Metrics has reported that a number of on-chain trends show that Bitcoin is in a similar spot now as it was at the start of 2017 bull run. But, there are some bearish factors that could suppress upside….There are also some unknowns around how China will address Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as President Xi Jinping is expected to speak on technological developments on Wednesday.”

Coin Metrics notes in its latest State of the Network report that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) network metrics had “relatively stable weeks, apart from large swings in transaction fees.”

Coin Metrics confirms that ETH transaction fees kept falling after the “unprecedented DeFi-driven growth” during the summer months of 2020. Meanwhile, BTC fees “went in the opposite direction, growing by 15.2% week-over-week and averaging about $1M per day,” Coin Metrics’ report noted.

It added:

“Ethereum hash rate (the amount of computing power securing the network) hit a new all-time high of 254.36 TH/s on October 6, 2020. Ethereum hash rate has been growing since mid-July thanks to the rise of DeFi. The large increase in fees meant more revenue for miners, which incentivized more miners to join the network and caused hash rate to grow.”

USDC, one of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, also had a solid week with supply increasing by around 200M to a total of more than 2.8B. USDC keeps growing faster than Tether, the leading stablecoin, Coin Metrics’ report revealed.

In a research note on Tuesday, JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote that Square's Cash App, which added bitcoin trading in 2018, surpassed the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as a vehicle for bitcoin purchases by US millennials in Q2. Given the app's popularity, JPMorgan strategists believe ""other payments companies to follow in facilitating client bitcoin investments or risk being left behind.""

Indeed, payment giants PayPal and Venmo are said to be in the works to offer crypto buying and selling services to their millions of users. PayPal has separately revealed that it is developing crypto capabilities.

Square's Cash App facilitated $858 million worth of bitcoin purchases in Q2, while Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust facilitated $750 million worth of bitcoin buys in the same quarter. ""We believe that millennials, or the younger cohorts of the US retail investors universe, have been using the Cash App as an alternative vehicle to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to add to their bitcoin holdings,"" said JPMorgan strategists.



While Square is yet to reveal numbers for Q3, analysts said assuming similar demand of $700 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust implies that U.S. millennials purchased around $1400 million worth of bitcoin in the quarter.

'Strong vote of confidence'

JPMorgan strategists also view Square's recent $50 million worth of bitcoin purchase as a ""strong vote of confidence"" for the future of the cryptocurrency. While the payment company's bitcoin investment is smaller than MicroStrategy's $425 million bet, it is ""likely the beginning,"" according to strategists.

Square and MicroStrategy's moves signal the emergence of corporates as a source of bitcoin demand, said analysts, adding that the demand/ supply (mining) balance for bitcoin improved to more than $925 million in Q3 versus $544 million in Q2.

Bitcoin derivatives, i.e., futures and options, are also seeing increased retail and institutional demand, according to strategists. They said the open interest in CME's bitcoin futures and BitMEX's bitcoin perpetual swap contracts ""increased sharply until mid-August before the September correction saw a retrenchment.""

Bitcoin options have also seen a significant increase in open interest, said analysts, adding that it remains ""heavily skewed"" towards Deribit than CME Group. ""As we believe institutional clients would likely prefer to trade options contracts on a well-established and regulated exchange like CME, this suggests that Bitcoin options activity remains more retail-driven,"" said analysts.",,https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-mining-and-how-does-it-work,"In brief Bitcoin mining is the process of adding and verifying blocks of transactions to Bitcoin’s public blockchain.

Bitcoin uses the “proof of work” consensus mechanism, which demands commitment from miners in the form of expensive mining hardware and electricity.

Miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle, and are rewarded with newly-minted Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining is the process by which blocks of transactions are added to the public blockchain and verified. It’s also the process by which new Bitcoin is created—a mechanism that both secures the integrity of the blockchain and incentivizes participation in the network.

Miners compete to add new blocks to the blockchain. Mining Bitcoin demands a substantial commitment on the part of miners; it’s a costly, time-consuming task, and one that’s necessary for the cryptocurrency to work and for people to have faith in its legitimacy.

Over a decade since Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, most people have heard of mining. But what does it really mean—and how do you go about mining Bitcoin?

What is Bitcoin mining?

Mining Bitcoin isn’t like digging for gold or coal deep underground. It refers to verifying the transactions made using Bitcoin. Miners are those individuals or companies that sustain and audit the blockchain network that supports the cryptocurrency.



They do so by completing ""blocks"" of verified transactions, which are added to the blockchain; when a miner completes a block, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

Did you know? Approximately every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is halved, an event known (unsurprisingly) as the “halving”. In May 2020, the block reward dropped from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC.

Mining for Bitcoin isn’t as cheap as it once was, but this still doesn’t prevent investors from carrying out this activity. The block reward of Bitcoin is the incentive that powers cryptocurrency transactions through legitimizing and monitoring the network. Because this responsibility is carried out by many users throughout the world, Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning that it relies on no central authority such as a government or bank for its trustworthiness.

Why does Bitcoin need miners?

Mining is, in effect, a process of auditing and verifying Bitcoin transactions to prevent the problem of “double spending”. Double spending is where someone with cryptocurrency tries to spend the same coin twice. With physical currency, you can’t buy a drink in a pub with a £20 note and then pop to the shops to buy some groceries with the same £20 note.

With cryptocurrency, there is a risk that someone with Bitcoin could make a copy of that Bitcoin and send that to a merchant instead of the real thing. In the real world, the cashier looks at a £20 note to ensure it is not fake—and this is what Bitcoin miners are trying to do with cryptocurrency; they are checking to ensure that a transaction has not been made twice.

What is the process of Bitcoin mining and what can you do with it?

Bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof of work.

The process of mining Bitcoin works as follows:

🖥️ A miner’s computer, called a node, collects and packages individual Bitcoin transactions from the last ten minutes into a block.

🖧 This node competes with other nodes in the network to solve a complicated cryptographic problem to be the first to validate the new block for the blockchain.

📡 The first miner to solve the problem broadcasts their success to the entire network.

🧮 Other nodes then check if their solution is correct. If correct, the new block is added to the blockchain and the whole process starts again.

💰 As the miner was first to solve the problem, it gets rewarded with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining hardware runs a cryptographic hashing function on a block header.

What that means is that each miner creates a “candidate block” with unconfirmed transactions from the node’s memory pool, or mempool. This block includes a block header that summarizes the data inside the block, along with a reference to an existing block in the blockchain and a nonce (“number only used once”). In Bitcoin, the nonce is a whole number somewhere between 0 and 4,294,967,296.

This block header is then put through the SHA256 hash function; if the resulting number is higher than the current target hash, the miner adjusts the nonce and tries again. Miners do this many thousands of times per second. The difficulty target is a 256-bit number; it is adjusted every 2016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), to ensure that a block is mined on average once every 10 minutes.

When a lucky miner’s hash function spits out a result that’s lower than the current target hash, the block is broadcast to the network. Each node checks that the block header hashes to meet the target, and if confirmed the newly mined block is added to the blockchain. The miner receives a reward of Bitcoin; this transaction, which creates new Bitcoin out of thin air, is known as the “coinbase transaction” and is included in the candidate block.

These rewards serve to incentivize participation and keep things running smoothly.

The rate at which coins are issued is set by the mining code, ensuring that the time it takes for a miner to win a block is always approximately 10 minutes. This is to protect the system and prevent miners from creating their own Bitcoin.

Every time Bitcoin is mined, the cryptographic problem becomes harder to solve, meaning that miners will require a higher hash rate to succeed in earning block rewards. This means that more computing power is needed to earn the same amount of cryptocurrency.

The first Bitcoin miners used their computers’ CPUs to complete the cryptographic problems. Soon, miners discovered that graphics processing units (GPUs) were more effective than CPUs, sparking an arms race in mining hardware. Now, miners use dedicated hardware known as ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners.

Solving cryptographic problems is necessary to protect the Bitcoin network from attacks. To reverse transactions in the blockchain would require 51% of the whole network’s computing power. This ensures that any attack is difficult and pointless as an attacker would have to own more mining hardware than anyone else.

The future of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) mining

As Bitcoin mining has matured, the barrier to entry for individual miners has been raised. Now, most mining is carried out by “pools” of miners who combine their resources and attempt to use their cumulative computing power to earn Bitcoin rewards.

In 2020, the majority of mining pools are based in China, although the country’s dominance of the industry has slipped somewhat over the course of the year. Miners are heavily influenced by electricity prices, since proof-of-work mining uses large quantities of electricity; many miners relocate their operations to make the most of cheap electricity.

Did you know? The supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. When all 21 million BTC are mined, in around 2140, miners will be rewarded with transaction fees.

Bitcoin mining has come in for criticism over its high energy consumption, which in 2020 was around 8.4 GW or 65.74 terawatt-hours—more than the output of seven nuclear power plants. Some advocates of the cryptocurrency argue that it functions as an “energy currency” that incentivizes the use of surplus energy. Indeed, several power plants in the USA and Iran are now using surplus natural gas to operate large-scale Bitcoin mining operations.

Being a fully compliant #powerplant-#bitcoinmining hybrid, we are uniquely positioned to generate electricity in-house. By purchasing forward contracts of #naturalgas, we are able to lock in our production cost for months. #Stability is one of our most important characteristics. https://t.co/AoWters2jX — Greenidge Generation (@GreenidgeLLC) August 26, 2020

Nevertheless, renewable energy only makes up 39% of the total energy consumption of the world’s cryptocurrency miners; Bitcoin miners generate a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Denmark.

Stung by this criticism, some cryptocurrencies are switching from a proof of work consensus mechanism to a system known as proof of stake (PoS).

Instead of miners, proof of stake cryptocurrencies have validators. These validators stake their cryptocurrency on betting which blocks will be added next to a chain. If successful, the validators get a block reward in proportion to what they have staked. Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, is switching to a proof of stake model with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

Bitcoin, however, is sticking with the tried-and-true proof of work consensus model espoused by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, over a decade ago.",2020-10-14 10:19:22,https://cryptobriefing.com/institutions-rush-bitcoin-grayscales-record-breaking-q3/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Grayscale Investments announced its best-ever quarterly report, with a record-breaking $1.05 billion flowing into its cryptocurrency investment products.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was the best performing product for Grayscale, with inflows of $720 million since last quarter.

Grayscale’s assets under management reached all-time highs during Q3 of 2020 for all its products, growing from $2.0 billion to $5.9 billion.

Between July to September, Grayscale saw $1.05 billion going into its investment products, the bulk of which went into Bitcoin. This was the third consecutive record-breaking quarter for the company.

Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset management company, released its Q3 investment report showcasing another exceptional quarter for institutional interest in Bitcoin.

The report’s highlight is that Q3 of 2020 was the most successful quarter in Grayscale’s history. During the period, Grayscale saw $1.05 billion going into its cryptocurrency investment products. This was the largest money inflow recorded by the company in a single quarter since its inception.

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Breaks Records

Among all of its products, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust brought in the most funds and witnessed an inflow of about $720 million in the last quarter.

GBTC also proved to be the best performing product for Grayscale in terms of assets under management, going from $1.9 billion to $4.8 billion year-to-date. This shows that appetite for Bitcoin remained high among investors this quarter.

Grayscale further detailed that the demand for other investment products increased, with capital inflows of 31% into products other than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. These inflows show that investors are also bullish on altcoins.

Among alternative products, investors had the highest appetite for Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN), and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), according to the report.

Financial Institutions Want Cryptocurrency

Grayscale reported that more than 80% of investments into its products came from institutional investors during the quarter. Here, it was the hedge funds that dominated institutional investments.

The report also mentioned that year-to-date capital inflows into its products exceeded $2.4 billion, which is more than double the $1.2 billion in investment funds it secured for its products between 2013-2019.

Yet another point is the astounding rise of Grayscale’s assets under management in the last quarter. AUM for all products reached an all-time high in Q3, growing from $2.0 billion to $5.9 billion⁠, representing a 195% rise.

Continued growth in Grayscale’s cryptocurrency investment products could indicate what’s to come for the rest of the market.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin market capitalization “is a drop in the bucket compared with markets Bitcoin could disrupt,” says Ria Bhutoria, Director Of Research at Fidelity

The report estimates that Bitcoin’s market capitalization could increase to as much as $2 trillion, nearly a 10-fold increase from current levels.

BTC is an exceptional hedge against adverse conditions in traditional finance, making it an attractive investment for institutions, says Fidelity.

Share this article

Fidelity published a report last week focused on Bitcoin’s role as an alternative investment and how investing in BTC can help institutions diversify and eliminate risks related to traditional asset classes.

The report reveals positive benefits for hypothetical portfolios holding Bitcoin versus only traditional assets. Portfolios containing BTC outperform the competition in every scenario, highlighting the opportunity for institutional investors who take the leap into Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s $2 Trillion Market Potential

Observations about the value locked in traditional assets and Bitcoin reveal exciting conclusions for crypto. According to the report, if Bitcoin manages to capture just 5% of the current alternative investments market it would gain $670 billion in market cap, in addition to its current $210 billion capitalization. Capturing 10% would result in a gain of $1.3 trillion.

Fidelity estimates that Bitcoin could gain a portion of the bond market⁠ given its historically low yields in addition to the alternative assets market. With just 1% of the bond market flowing into BTC, the cryptocurrency could gain an incremental $500 billion in addition to the market capitalization from the alternative investment market.

In the most optimistic scenario predicted by Fidelity, Bitcoin could achieve a market capitalization of $2 trillion, roughly 10-times what it is now.

Considering the growth in the BTC supply from mining in such a scenario, a single Bitcoin would trade at about $100,000.

BTC Hedges Against Traditional Finance

The report also covers common arguments about Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 index, gold, and other traditional asset classes. Regarding correlation, the report reads:

“In the past, bitcoin has experienced brief periods of elevated correlations with particular assets, including gold and equities, but the relationships break down over longer time horizons.”

Over the five years observed, Bhutoria noted that a long-term correlation between BTC and other asset classes does not exist, saying:

“Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets from January 2015 to September 2020 is an average of 0.11, indicating there is almost no relationship between the returns of Bitcoin and other assets. Correlations fall within the range of -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation…”

It’s easy to bundle correlation and causation to events happening in a short period on a micro-scale. Retail and institutional investors regularly fall victim to psychological fallacies that lead to poor investment decisions. For example, selling the cryptocurrency when the S&P 500 loses value, suggested the report.

Time will tell if institutional investors respond to this report. If they decide to buy some of Bitcoin’s 21-million possible coins, then current cryptocurrency holders would stand to gain.

Institutions could use Bitcoin to diversify and hedge against adverse conditions in traditional finance—assuming crypto-assets are indeed uncorrelated to the rest of the market. However, Fidelity warns that as more institutions enter Bitcoin the potential for it to remain an asset for diversification will diminish.

Last week, the DOJ published an 83-page cryptocurrency enforcement framework detailing its approach to the nascent space and discussing potential crimes. The document also suggested the U.S. government would enforce its laws regardless of where exchanges – referred to as virtual asset service providers, or VASPs – are based. In other words, these exchanges should comply with U.S. laws – even for their non-U.S. customers:

“The Department also has robust authority to prosecute VASPs and other entities and individuals that violate U.S. law even when they are not located inside the United States. Where virtual asset transactions touch financial, data storage or other computer systems within the United States, the Department generally has jurisdiction to prosecute the actors who direct or conduct those transactions.”

The document came just days after prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) brought charges against crypto trading platform BitMEX, which is headquartered in the Seychelles, and its leaders, some of whom do not reside in the U.S.

“I do think this is definitely a warning shot about cryptocurrency exchanges that are located outside the U.S.,” Marta Belcher, special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and general counsel at Protocol Labs, said of the framework.

Interpreted broadly, the DOJ’s framework can also have implications for international exchanges that may have – or at one point, had – customers in the U.S. Exchanges that pulled out of the U.S. may not be safe either, based on the BitMEX charges.

That’s not to say every exchange operating outside the U.S. is at risk, or that the federal government is declaring open season on platforms it believes should be complying with its laws. Still, overseas exchanges that might have exposure to the U.S. should take note.

Global reach

The DOJ framework notes that the U.S. has had anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures for decades, with specific standards around cryptocurrency exchanges and activities since at least 2011.

Despite this, many VASPs, as the U.S. government refers exchanges – still do not necessarily comply with the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws, the framework claimed. The framework complained that some exchanges might hold U.S. customers to standards that do not apply to non-U.S. customers, or might treat crypto-to-crypto transactions differently from crypto-to-fiat transactions.

“Because of the global and cross-border nature of transactions involving virtual assets, the lack of consistent AML/CFT regulation and supervision over VASPs across jurisdictions – and the complete absence of such regulation and supervision in certain parts of the world – is detrimental to the safety and stability of the international financial system,” the framework said.

Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance, tweeted that policy makers are looking to tighten global restrictions on the trading of digital assets, in a change from how the crypto space was previously viewed.

In the DOJ’s view, international regulations should be consistent, the document said.

The new framework follows a pattern. Since 2018, the U.S. has spearheaded efforts to unite global regulatory efforts around cryptocurrency exchanges and transactions through its presidency of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental standards-setting organization.

Last June, when the U.S. was president, the FATF unveiled the so-called “Travel Rule” for VASPs, advising regulators to require exchanges hold or be able to access comprehensive KYC data, even for individuals receiving funds from a transaction but who weren’t their own customers. The FATF is composed of representatives from the Group of 7 nations, and the presidency rotated between member nations every year at that time.

Implementation of the travel rule is ongoing. Some countries already require strict KYC, while others are still determining what compliance might look like. Switzerland, for example, requires exchanges to verify personal wallets before allowing customers to withdraw their crypto.

In practice

The U.S. has gone after non-domestic platforms in the past. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation charged 1Broker, a crypto product exchange based in the Marshall Islands, on claims that it allowed U.S. customers to trade on its platform.

1Broker later settled the charges with the two agencies, allowing customers to withdraw funds through the end of 2019 before shutting its doors.

Earlier this month, the SDNY and the CFTC unveiled a variety of charges against BitMEX, one of the world’s largest crypto derivatives trading platforms – based in the Seychelles – as well as owners Arthur Hayes, Ben Delo and Samuel Reed. (SDNY brought an additional charge against Gregory Dwyer, an employee.)

Both agencies allege U.S. residents were able to trade on BitMEX, despite the company not registering as a futures commission merchant, derivatives contract market or swap execution facility with the CFTC or conduct know-your-customer processes in compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.

According to the indictment, the DOJ is alleging the defendants violated the Bank Secrecy Act and conspired to violate the Bank Secrecy Act across two separate charges. These charges could face criminal penalties, including jail time in addition to monetary fines.

“Beginning no later than November 2014 and continuing to the present (the ‘Relevant Period’), Defendants have offered commodity futures, options, and swaps on digital assets, including bitcoin, ether and litecoin, to persons in the United States, from offices in the United States, through the website www.bitmex.com and a mobile application,” the indictment said.

Speaking at the Digital Asset Compliance & Market Integrity Summit hosted by Solidus Labs last week, CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz hinted the agency may go after other platforms that violate U.S. law in some way – even if they aren’t based in the U.S.

“I think it’s very clear that if you’re operating outside the boundaries of the law and what the law requires, we will aggressively enforce it,” he said.

Future views

Berkovitz’s comments, alongside the enforcement framework itself, seem to be implying the BSA, a broad AML/KYC-focused law, are applicable outside of the U.S.

In other words, any transactions that might fit into the U.S. regulatory framework is fair game for enforcement, he said, a view the enforcement framework appeared to endorse.

“They’re extremely explicit that they feel they have authority to prosecute them if they violate U.S. laws even when they’re not located in the U.S.,” Belcher said. “There’s a pretty long section where they, I think, make it pretty clear that is a thing they are contemplating.”

This should not be a surprise, she added, saying this is at least “one takeaway” from the simple fact the paper was published.

The framework even acknowledges the DOJ’s past international efforts, saying the agency has “actively participated in international regulatory and criminal enforcement efforts” in the past.

The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Gate.io has launched a new type of hardware wallet that features fingerprint recognition. The device supports over 10,000 cryptocurrencies with wallet.io and multi-signature functionality with over 40 public chains.

The well known cryptocurrency exchange, Gate.io, has announced the launch of the S1 hardware wallet that supports multi-signature functionality and a unique way to keep funds secure. The S1 device is different because it comes with fingerprint recognition located on the in-built display. Gate.io’s CMO, Marie Tatibouet, detailed that the fingerprint creates an exclusive and unique password for every S1 owner.

“The private key is locked in the hardware itself, safely away from the internet, and it makes it more convenient in signature signing when the user makes a daily use transfer,” Tatibouet explained during the announcement.

The company claims all the owner needs is a computer or smartphone and then they can authorize a transfer transaction with a fingerprint. Gate.io believes the S1 framework will also bolster the firm’s Gatechain project and decentralized finance (defi) use cases.

“Wallet S1 can be used in combination with a Vault address at Gatechain,” Gate.io notes. The exchange considers the new S1 device to be “the first hardware wallet with the world-leading fingerprint recognition algorithm which can auto initialize when detecting brute-force attack.” S1 is also powered by the flagship SOC chip and a unique dual- CPU architecture.

Gate.io believes crypto asset security is extremely important in the defi space and noncustodial services allow crypto users to limit themselves from restrictions imposed by a centralized platform. According to the firm, the S1 hardware wallet will start at $50 and each unit is 60mm x 20mm x 6mm in size. The hardware device works in unison with the wallet.io platform.

The Hong Kong trading platform’s new device joins a myriad of hardware wallets available on the open market today. This includes products from Trezor, Ledger, Ellipal, Keepkey, Ngrave, Bitbox, Coolwallet, Bitlox, and Coldcard.

Grayscale Investments has announced a record quarterly performance, raking in $1.05 billion in investments, mostly from institutional investors. The company also sees “unprecedented demand” for bitcoin cash.

Record Quarter, Over $1 Billion Added

Grayscale Investments released its third-quarter performance Wednesday. The company tweeted:

We just recorded our largest ever quarterly inflows – over $1.0 billion in 3Q20 – making it the third consecutive record-breaking quarter. YTD investment into the Grayscale family of products has surpassed $2.4 billion.

Specifically, the company revealed that the total investment into its products in 3Q 2020 was $1.05 billion, noting that the majority of investment (81%) came from institutional investors, dominated by hedge funds. In the third quarter, offshore investors accounted for 57% of new investment capital into its products.

The total investment into Grayscale’s products was $2.7 billion over the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, which was more than double the $1.2 billion cumulative inflow into the company’s products from 2013 through 2019.

Unprecedented Demand for 3 Products

Grayscale also revealed that three products have seen “unprecedented demand.” The company detailed, “Grayscale’s Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Digital Large Cap [DLC] products have all seen over 10x growth in inflows quarter-over-quarter,” elaborating:

Unprecedented demand for BCH, LTC, and DLC … On average, the aforementioned products saw inflows increase by more than 1,400% quarter-over-quarter.

“These developments followed FINRA’s verification in July that the required diligence to begin quoting the bitcoin cash and litecoin products … had been completed,” the company explained.

Grayscale Investments’ total net asset under management is $6.3 billion as of Tuesday. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had the most asset under management ($5,157 million), followed by the Ethereum Trust ($867.7 million) and the Digital Large Cap Fund ($92.0 million). The company described:

Investors appear to be interested in digital assets because they have outperformed major indices YTD.

Meanwhile, the company announced on Tuesday that, like GBTC, its Ethereum Trust had attained the status of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting company.

Key Takeaways Polkadot has announced that it will work on bringing Bitcoin to its ecosystem.

PolkaBTC project will be implemented by the Interlay team.

This will bring Bitcoin’s liquidity to DeFi applications on Polkadot and its network of parachains.

Share this article

With over $1.6 billion in Bitcoin now circulating on the Ethereum blockchain, Polkadot hopes to grab a slice of the market with its new PolkaBTC token.

Polkadot Introduces Tokenize Bitcoin

Blockchain teams are working to replicate the grand success of tokenized Bitcoin projects like wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). Polkadot has responded to this popularity and is launching a similar Polkadot-based Bitcoin token on its network.

Interlay, a development team closely associated with Polkadot, will lead the endeavor. Interlay says it will finish implementing “PolkaBTC” once it launches the BTC Parachain in Q1 2021. To make the process secure, the BTC Parachain will rely on the Xclaim framework, the Interlay team wrote.



A cross-chain bridge will onboard the Bitcoin’s liquidity to Polkadot’s ecosystem. After the BTC Parachain goes live in Q1 2021, users will be able to lock their Bitcoin and issue PolkaBTC, which is 1:1 backed. Similarly, to redeem their Bitcoin, users will have to burn PolkaBTC on the BTC Parachain.

Tokenized Bitcoin for Every Network

Tokenizing Bitcoin is not a new concept and already exists in many forms on Ethereum in forms like BitGo’s Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and Keep Network’s tBTC.

The total value of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) on Ethereum has already surpassed a billion dollars and brought a tremendous amount of liquidity to DeFi apps.

The advantage of Bitcoin on Polkadot is that the network is highly interoperable. This means that BTC can do more by interacting with multiple blockchains all at once. This means that DeFi and PolkaBTC could spread quickly beyond just the Ethereum ecosystem.

From rug-pulling to fake presales, DeFi experts and novice traders alike are bleeding valuable Ether (ETH) from these scams.

With DeFi creating a market segment where project initiation cost is near zero, rogue actors now have the perfect environment to continuously siphon funds from victims. Aided and abetted by a rabble of social media shills and the current climate of frenzied yield-chasing, these crypto con-artists are able to cart away huge sums of money that run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Instead of DeFi helping to democratize access to global finance, the emerging market niche is becoming overrun by scams. The sheer volume of swindles, rip-offs and other unsavory market practices seem to have also contributed to noticeable price-cooling in the sector, with investors growing wary of new projects.

Crime pays in DeFi

As far as scams go, the ones seen in the DeFi space follow the same basic playbook. Anonymous founders create a new project that is typically copied from existing token contract code and make minor changes to parameters such as total supply.

Typically leaning on whichever trend has most recently gained the DeFi market’s favor, these con artists flood Telegram groups and other social media platforms. With the help of “moon boys,” or paid shills with considerable Twitter followership, project creators get the word of mouth rolling about their supposed new DeFi “gem.” All these scams share the same premise: low market capitalization brought on by a limited supply of tokens guaranteeing huge returns for early adopters or around 1,000% gains.

However, with these projects centered around price and having little or no consideration for useful tech, the zero-sum game plays out as a steep decline in valuation that leaves most adopters holding bags of worthless ERC-20 tokens. For Douglas Horn, chief architect of the Telos blockchain network, the success of these scams thrives on unbridled desire for quick gains in the crypto market, as he told Cointelegraph:

“Any time you are chasing this type of FOMO market action, then you’re already making a mistake because you are betting on your ability to make a profit by being faster than the masses, knowing that it is impossible for all or even most participants to pull this off. That is always going to end in tears for most participants and is an extremely poor investment strategy. [...] Good investments don’t have that level of FOMO or time crunch.”

When not rug-pulling, some project developers are adding malicious lines of code designed to steal funds from their users. Yield farmers on the dubious UniCats protocol recently saw their entire token balances siphoned by a rogue developer.

Hiding behind anonymity, project creators and promoters alike prey on the gullibility of some crypto investors. In some cases, these rogue actors elect to use the long-con approach of cultivating a huge following and appearing to be against scams. Once their social media pull reaches a certain level, they advertise a token presale for a new yield-generating machine. Based on trust garnered by the project creators, investors pile in with their ETH and the con artists soon disappear with the funds.

Useful tips to avoid DeFi scammers

Amid the litany of fake coins listed on decentralized marketplaces like Uniswap comes the need to arm investors with useful information to avoid becoming victims. Given the novel nature of the sector, there is still a considerable knowledge gap among investors that makes them easy targets of these crypto con-artists. Malcolm Tan, a board member at automated market maker platform KingSwap, told Cointelegraph that the onus is on investors to do their own due diligence:

“It is very important to look at the team and founders, and check their LinkedIn profiles and those of their advisors to see that they have actually listed the said project. [...] Read all you can about the projects and make sure to think about how you would get your money back if you put it into the project — meaning that the projects that do not even state their location or jurisdiction nor have any known faces that you can look to if things go south, shouldn’t be touched.”

According to Michael Gu, founder of popular crypto YouTube channel Boxmining, DeFi investors need to adopt the philosophy of “don’t trust, verify.” Writing to Cointelegraph, Gu advised yield chasers to become adept at researching DeFi projects, adding that anyone can easily check “how much a developer has built in terms of code, to ensure they’re not lying or embellishing,” adding:

“Spending the time to research is key, personally I spend up to six hours a day on research alone. Right now, the best way to avoid scams is by verifying facts — which includes looking at the smart contract code and GitHub repositories. This is the best part about DeFi as smart contracts are open-source and open to everyone to verify and validate.”

As rug-pulls are made possible due to unlocked project liquidity, it has become popular for investors to check whether the developers of a new token have locked the liquidity using services like Unicrypt. Even with locked liquidity, malicious codes hidden in the contract can also present a backdoor for rogue actors to drain funds. For example, in February 2020, hackers were able to exploit a code weakness to execute flash loan attacks on the decentralized lending protocol bZx, resulting in a loss of around 1,139 ETH, worth around $1 million at the time.

Taking the shine off a legitimate crypto niche

Aside from the significant losses incurred by victims of these scams, the sheer volume of fraudulent activity is reportedly taking its toll on the DeFi market as a whole. As was the case with initial coin offerings, fake projects are impeding attempts to bootstrap the democratization of global finance.

Commenting on the negative impact of these scams, Horn told Cointelegraph that blockchain should represent transparency and trust, but “instead, it’s most prominently associated with these scams and unaudited code the same way that the failure of many ICOs to deliver on their promises helped sink crypto in early 2018.” According to Horn, the current situation in the DeFi space is escalating even further than that seen during the ICO craze:

“DeFi cycles are happening at a much faster pace. All of this detracts from the amazing potential for democratized finance to build powerful systems and self-created derivatives from chaining together many different financial primitives. Someday this will change the world, but not until there is more stability and quality to the offerings.”

There is an emerging trend in the DeFi space that has seen the market transition from yield farming to “Ponzinomics,” with rug-pulls and fraudulent presales becoming an everyday occurrence over the past few weeks. For Gu, these scams threaten to deflate the hype and enthusiasm surrounding the DeFi space:

“These scams are affecting people’s interest in yield farming, which is the main draw for people since some farms promised unrealistically high returns not seen before. And with the interest and returns in yield farming decreasing due to people’s fear of scams, the corresponding interest in DeFi in general is also losing steam.”

However, not every stakeholder shares the opinion that these DeFi scams are the death knell of the emerging crypto market. Rafael Cosman, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer TrustToken, told Cointelegraph that the DeFi space can overcome challenges brought on by rogue actors:

“Every new technology is subject to bad actors that, all too often, are also early adopters. Edge technology has frequently been a draw for moneymaking scams, pornography, or the sale of illicit goods — but when good, creative people keep building, you get technologies like the modern internet. [...] I predict DeFi will keep innovating, consumers will keep getting smarter, and the standards will keep increasing on what qualifies as worth putting your funds into.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/isle-of-man-regulator-says-bitcoin-ether-not-considered-securities-in-new-guidance,"The financial watchdog of the Isle of Man, a self-governing British Crown dependency, has clarified how it will treat cryptocurrencies and other tokens, and which might be regulated as securities.",2020-10-15 10:32:37+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/new-zealand-man-charged-with-money-laundering-via-crypto-and-luxury-cars,"Disclosure

Bitcoin’s intrinsic value has been heavily discussed in the crypto community this week following a remark by the governor of the Bank of England suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have no intrinsic value.

Does Bitcoin Have Intrinsic Value?

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about bitcoin’s intrinsic value during a question and answer session with members of the public early this week. “I have to be honest, it is hard to see that bitcoin has what we tend to call intrinsic value,” he was quoted by Reuters as saying. “It may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it.” Furthermore, the governor said people using bitcoin for payments makes him “very nervous” because the value of the cryptocurrency is uncertain.

Following Bailey’s remark, the crypto community began discussing bitcoin’s intrinsic value in some detail. Michael Saylor, the CEO of Nasdaq-listed company Microstrategy that recently bought $425 million worth of bitcoin for its treasury reserve, tweeted:

Bitcoin is the first digital monetary system capable of storing all the money in the world for every individual, corporation, and government in a fair & equitable manner, without losing any of it. If that’s not intrinsically valuable, what is?

JPMorgan’s strategists, including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a note on Tuesday about bitcoin’s intrinsic value approaching its market price. “Bitcoin faces a ‘modest headwind’ in the short term based on an analysis of bets in the futures market and an estimate of the cryptocurrency’s intrinsic value,” Bloomberg reported them explaining, adding that they said the price remains about 13% higher than an estimate of intrinsic value.

A number of people on Twitter were quick to point out that bitcoin may have no intrinsic value, but neither do fiat currencies. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis published a report back in 2018 stating:

Bitcoin is not the only currency that has no intrinsic value. State monopoly currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc, have no intrinsic value either.

“They are fiat currencies created by government decree. The history of state monopoly currencies is a history of wild price swings and failures. This is why decentralized cryptocurrencies are a welcome addition to the existing currency system,” the report notes.

“There is no such thing as ‘intrinsic value,'” Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees opined. “Value is always subjective, in the eyes of the valuer … Gold, bitcoin, fiat, rice: none have ‘intrinsic value.'”

Twitter user Bob McElrath shared the sentiment. “Nothing has ‘intrinsic value,’ because the word ‘value’ is human sentiment, and changes with time and circumstance. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something,” he described. “Despite not having ‘intrinsic’ value, bitcoin has a sophisticated, market-based way to determine its value, not only on the demand side but on the supply side as well. Of course, this statement is true for any commodity.”

Cato’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives director George Selgin chimed in:

Of course no goods have ‘intrinsic’ value. Some (like any fiat money) also lack ‘non-monetary use value’ … the Bank of England’s observation that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value is an instance of the pot calling the kettle black.

Though the exchange was seized by police under allegations of fraud, this is not the first instance in which a cryptocurrency exchange has been accused of wash trading.

In March 2019, Bitwise Asset Management told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its presentation that 95% of bitcoin trading volume globally is fake and/or non-economic in nature. In fact, the largest crypto exchange from South Korea, Upbit, has also been under scrutiny for wash trading after its officials were indicted for fraud in late 2018. This article will examine why exchanges conduct wash trading and analyze the Coinbit wash trading fiasco in detail.

What Is Wash Trading, and Why Do Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable It?

Wash trading of cryptocurrency is a process in which an exchange trades with itself to create an appearance of greater liquidity or manipulate the value of the assets being traded. Cryptocurrency exchanges have strong economic incentives to inflate trading volumes and manipulate market prices. As most cryptocurrency exchanges generate profit by charging transaction fees, trading volume is crucial for attracting traders to the exchange and increasing market share. Third-party market data platforms such as CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare and CoinGecko rely on the trading data provided by exchanges to determine each platform’s market share, which is used by prospective traders to assess which exchanges to use.

Wash trading enables newly formed exchanges to gain a large market share within a few months, and this has become a lucrative shortcut to marketing success for many young exchanges. For example, in the case of Coinbit, the exchange is accused of using multiple “ghost accounts” to inflate trading volume. According to estimates, up to 99% of Coinbit’s trading volume is said to have been manipulated between August 2019 to May 2020, which resulted in “unfair profits” of about US$84 million equivalent.

What We Know About Coinbit Wash Trading So Far

To investigate Coinbit’s wash trading in detail, Merkle Science’s data science team looked into the deposits and withdrawals of Coinbit’s known cryptocurrency addresses during August 2019 to May 2020. Following is what we found:

Total deposits in Bitcoin = 2964.67

Total deposits in USD = 24,637,718

Total withdrawals in Bitcoin = 3248.48

Total deposits in USD = 27,600,786

Total withdrawal/deposits in Bitcoin: 6213.15

Total withdrawal/deposits in USD: 52,238,504



As the above data outlines, total deposits and withdrawals on the exchange from August 2019 to May 2020 were a little over USD $52 million, and most of the deposits and withdrawals were from “unidentified sources.” However, wash trading helped Coinbit make a profit of USD $84 million during this period.

It is important to note here that the Seoul Shinmun report also highlights the role of “ghost accounts.” According to the report, the police said that Coinbit owner Choi Mo and the management team inflated the transaction volume and manipulated the market price by buying and selling coins between accounts inside the exchange through multiple ghost accounts.

Conclusion

As cases of wash trading on cryptocurrency exchanges rise, it is important to acknowledge the lack of continuous monitoring of cryptocurrency transactions on exchanges that need to be fixed. Along with tougher regulations and cooperation between industry stakeholders, continuous monitoring of transactions on exchanges and VASPs is necessary, as it will not only help in preventing wash trading but also help detect money laundering, terrorism financing and other illicit trade through cryptocurrencies.",2020-10-15 07:00:13+00:00

Key Takeaways Bitcoin is down more than 3% in the past 24 hours, signaling a potential correction towards $10,800.

Ethereum is holding above a key supply wall after taking a 5% nosedive.

XRP lost a crucial area of support and it may be headed to $0.22.

Share this article

More than $10 billion has been wiped out of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization after OKEx announced it would be suspending all withdrawals. The significant capital outflow saw Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP drop in tandem by more than 3%.

Now, different technical indexes suggest that all the markets could quickly turn from bad to worse as sell pressure mounts.

Bitcoin Seems to Have More Legs Down

Bitcoin’s price action has been contained within an ascending parallel channel ever since the September market crash.

Each time BTC has risen to the upper boundary of this technical formation, it drops to hit the lower edge, and from this point, it bounces back up again. This behavior is consistent with the characteristics of a channel.

Following the recent news about OKEx, the flagship cryptocurrency retraced nearly 3% and is now trading around the middle line of the parallel channel. A spike in sell orders around the current price levels could push BTC further down to the lower boundary of this technical pattern as has happened over the past month.

When looking at IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model, this thesis holds.

Based on this on-chain metric, Bitcoin faces a stiff resistance barrier ahead while it sits on top of weak support. An increase in selling pressure may indeed push prices to the next significant area of support, around $10,800.

Here, approximately 1.3 million addresses had previously purchased nearly 900,000 BTC. Such a critical supply barrier may have the ability to keep falling prices at bay.

Regardless, on-chain analyst Willy Woo maintains that the selling pressure behind the pioneer cryptocurrency is decreasing over time, which is a “sure sign of bull season.”

The pessimistic outlook will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to slice through the overhead resistance between $11,400 and $11,700. Turning this price hurdle into support will signal the breakout of the ascending parallel channel previously mentioned. Under such circumstances, BTC might march towards $13,000.

Ethereum Sits on Top of Massive Support Wall

Ethereum has been on a downtrend over the past four days that has seen its price drop by nearly 9%.

The sell-off came after the rejection from the x-axis of an ascending triangle that appears to be developing on its 4-hour chart since Sept. 5. Since then, Ether’s price action led to a horizontal line formation along with the swing highs and a rising trendline along with the swing lows.

If sell orders continue to pile up, the smart contracts giant would likely look for support around the ascending triangle’s hypotenuse. This critical barrier currently sits at $350.

Despite the high probability of a steeper decline, IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP reveals that Ethereum bears will have difficulty pushing prices down. Roughly 650,000 addresses had previously purchased 11.5 million ETH between $360 and $370.

Holders within this price range may buy more tokens to avoid seeing their positions go into the red. But if the sell-off intensifies, a drop to $350 is almost guaranteed, while slicing through this support level could trigger a 20% retracement.

On the flip side, investors must pay close attention to the x-axis of the ascending triangle previously mentioned. If the bulls manage to turn the $390 resistance into support, the odds for a 20% jump will increase drastically.

Such an upswing might see Ether rise to $470.

XRP Is Doomed to Retrace

Like the rest of the market, XRP was also affected by the recent news about OKEx. The cross-border remittances token took a nearly 4% nosedive in the past few hours. The downswing was significant enough to push prices below the 100-day moving average, which was acting as strong support.

Now that this critical barrier has been turned into resistance, XRP could drop further. Based on the descending parallel channel that formed in early August, this cryptocurrency could see its price plummet towards the channel’s middle or lower boundary.

These support levels sit at $0.22 and $0.19, respectively.

The only thing that could save XRP from such a pessimistic outlook is a break above the $0.26 resistance level. Slicing through this price hurdle will signal a breakout of the descending parallel channel previously mentioned.

By drawing a parallel line equal to the channel’s width, the upswing might see prices rise to $0.30.

The Crypto Market Moves Forward

Over the past few hours, the sell-off pushed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP to critical support barriers. It seems that this new wave of FUD has discouraged investors from all the latest positive developments. Although OKEx’s users may not be able to withdraw their cryptocurrencies at the moment, data suggests that all funds are “SAFU.”

Though there is little reason to panic, short-sighted market participants will likely add a dose of volatility.

Thus investors must pay close attention to the different price levels previously mentioned. A potential downswing could be the last opportunity for sidelined investors to get back into the market before a new bull cycle begins.

Far beyond the immediate material impact, the NYDFS states that the incident exposed deep cybersecurity weaknesses of a publicly-traded social media company valued at $37 billion and counting over 330 million active monthly users. The discovery has serious consequences in light of the platform’s ever-expanding influence on both financial markets and the political sphere.

Two key sections of the NYFDS report, published on Oct. 14, tackle the Twitter hack’s impact on the department’s cryptocurrency licensees, and how these companies responded to protect their clients from the fraud. NYFDS also surveyed and compiled crypto firms’ recommendations on how to prevent a similar cyberattack from succeeding in the future.

The agency notes that in the third phase of the hack, the attackers took aim at the Twitter accounts of crypto companies, which included NYDFS-regulated entities. These “responded quickly to block impacted addresses, demonstrating the maturity of New York’s cryptocurrency marketplace and those authorized to engage within it. Their actions show that New York continues to set a high standard and attract only the most responsible actors.”

Coinbase, Gemini and Square, all of which provide wallet services and whose Twitter accounts were hacked, rapidly blocked the Bitcoin addresses posted by the hackers on Twitter. According to NYFDS’ survey, each of the companies blocked the relevant addresses within 40 minutes of their accounts being hacked.

Fifteen surveyed crypto firms in total blocked transfers to the addresses, while seven did not. The report notes that some companies have different business models and do not directly handle custody and transfer services, which accounts for their inaction.

Among those that do, Coinbase blocked around 5,670 transfers, valued at roughly $1,294,000; Square blocked 358, valued at roughly $51,000; Gemini blocked two, valued at roughly $1,8000; and Bitstamp blocked one, valued at $250.

The other focus of the NYFDS survey and report was to analyze which security measures the crypto firms took to protect their social media accounts following the hack, and gather key recommendations to cement security going forward.

These included using strong and unique passwords, monitoring social media accounts for unauthorized posts, using multi-factor authentication but avoiding SMS-based MFA due to its susceptibility to hacks, and limiting employee access to social media accounts.

Placing the hack in context, NYFDS notes that in 2019, millions of people worldwide lost over $4.3 billion to cryptocurrency scams — up from just $650 million in 2018. Exploiting the pandemic, scammers have already stolen over $380 million in the first half of 2020. One scammer tactic that intersects with the Twitter hack “impersonating Elon Musk on Twitter” has already cost victims almost $200,000 in Bitcoin. Such incidents have spurred the entrepreneur to warn his followers:",,https://www.etfstream.com/news/sec-considers-green-light-for-crypto-etfs/,"SEC considers green light for crypto ETFs

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaging with the market about the possible introduction of cryptocurrency ETFs, according to Chairman Jay Clayton.

Speaking at a conference on innovation and regulation within digital assets, Clayton discussed the responsibilities of the regulators to drive the implementation of cryptocurrencies and digital assets across various financial markets including ETFs.

“Regarding the tokenisation of ETFs, [the SEC] should be driving that and we are willing to be driving that,” Clayton said.

He added the regulator's “door is wide open” to meet with market participants who can show how the tokenisation of ETFs can add efficiency.

Furthermore, Clayton said the SEC would facilitate this if it is shown to be beneficial to the market.

A number of firms have begun exploring the idea of trading ETFs as a token using blockchain similar to trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Why the UK remains years not months off a crypto ETP

In the last 18 months, there have been many discussions on the compatibility of cryptocurrencies and ETFs in the US.

However, the SEC rejected multiple proposals for a bitcoin ETF in 2019 from Bitwise and VanEck because the underlying blockchain technology did not meet the standard for preventing fraudulent activities.

Furthermore, Facebook’s proposition of a stablecoin, Libra, last year saw the market labelling the digital asset as an ETF while the ETF industry argued otherwise.

The SEC remains very hesitant in green lighting any digital assets without a thorough examination so the introduction of a tokenised ETF is not expected in the immediate future.",2020-10-16 12:38:41,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/new-civil-liberties-alliance-challenges-irs-collection-of-private-crypto-investment-data,"The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Bitcoin investor whose private data was collected by the IRS without warrant.

The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Bitcoin investor whose private data was collected by the IRS without warrant.

If you’re a bitcoin trader or investor, you’ve probably traded on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges and, for the most part, trusted that those exchanges are keeping your data secure from unlawful data collection just like a bank or credit card provider would. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case.

On July 15, 2020 (Tax Day this year), New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) filed a lawsuit on behalf of James Harper against the IRS, challenging the agency's unlawful collection of private cryptocurrency information.

Harper decided to take this action against the IRS after he received a letter from the agency in August 2019 as part of its ongoing effort to alert taxpayers about crypto tax filing requirements. Harper wants to hold the IRS accountable for violating his privacy and identifying him as a cryptocurrency holder.

According to a case summary, “NCLA represents Mr. Harper before the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Harper’s ‘crime’? Holding a bitcoin wallet. The lawsuit argues that the IRS has acquired the unbridled power to demand and seize Americans’ private financial information from third parties without any judicial process in defiance of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and statutory protections.”

Some of you reading may even know Harper. He bought his first bitcoin in 2013 and has been an active member of the community ever since. According to the case, he has always paid his applicable taxes and reported his bitcoin trades. Like many of you reading, Harper used a few different cryptocurrency exchanges to conduct his trades, all of which contractually promised to protect his private information.

Last year, Harper became one of 10,000 crypto holders to suddenly receive a letter from the IRS stating that it had obtained his financial records from the cryptocurrency exchanges without any particular suspicious of wrongdoing. Additionally, the IRS failed to meet its statutory duty to give Harper advanced notice and an opportunity to challenge the seizing of his crypto data.

I’m not a lawyer, but that doesn’t sound like something the IRS should be able to do. I thought the government needed a subpoena to obtain private information. Is it able to obtain any data it wants without a warrant? So, what does a lawyer on the case think of this?

“There’s no IRS exception to the Bill of Rights,” Adi Dynar, a member of the litigation counsel, told me. “The people who own cryptocurrency do not thereby give up the right to secure the privacy of their private financial information. No federal official should obtain private financial information without giving its owner adequate notice and opportunity to contest. Especially so when the federal official has not obtained a valid subpoena or warrant from a court. Otherwise, it is a short, slippery slope into an unfettered surveillance state.”

When I sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange account, or any other service with a third party that contains private information and is contractually obligated to protect my private information, that is exactly what I expect that third party to do. It’s frightening to see the third party and government sidestepping our contractual rights and law. This makes me wonder what other information is being collected by government agencies without a warrant. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re much further down the path of a surveillance state than most realize. I hope that NCLA's lawsuit will right this wrong and protect people from unlawful searches and seizures in the future.

Given NCLA’s close alignment with the cryptocurrency community, it has recently started to accept cryptocurrency to help fund this case. Your donation of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency to the New Civil Liberties Alliance is one of the most tax efficient ways to stop government overreach.

On Oct. 8, right on cue, mobile payments giant Square, which boasts a market cap of $86.6 billion, announced that it had invested $50 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Five days later, asset manager Stone Ridge Holdings, which manages over $10 billion in assets, disclosed that it had purchased more than 10,000 BTC, worth around $114 million, as part of its treasury reserve strategy.

They both followed MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed asset manager, which made known last month that it had accumulated $425 million in Bitcoin, making BTC the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.

Three publicly owned companies, three big BTC purchases — it may be mere coincidence. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned by $3 trillion since the beginning of 2019, while the U.S. dollar has depreciated 70% against BTC — as Stone Ridge founder Ross Stevens noted in the firm’s Oct. 13 press release.

BTC: The new reserve asset?

How do the cognoscenti explain it? The U.S. dollar is falling; bond yields are almost non-existent; and gold is underperforming. Liquidity-flush firms have fewer places to put their cash — so they are turning to cryptocurrency. “We are seeing a new trend emerge where corporations are using Bitcoin as a reserve asset for part or majority of their treasury,” pronounced Anthony Pompliano in his Oct. 15 newsletter. Saifedean Ammous, economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking, told Cointelegraph:

“While I would have expected to see such firms take small positions more as a hedge, it speaks volume to the growing credibility of Bitcoin that as soon as they became intrigued by the value proposition, they chose to go with a large allocation.”

“Scrambling for alternative investments”

Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda — a forex trading company — told Cointelegraph that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the macro backdrop for fiat currencies, adding: “The Fed, in particular, has clearly signaled an ultra-accommodative monetary stance will remain in place for a few years, and that is making many institutional investors scramble for alternative investments.”

Gold, the traditional safe haven in crisis times, has disappointed recently, and as a result, “Bitcoin has emerged as a favorite diversification play away from bonds and will likely steadily attract new institutional investors,” said Moya. Ammous further added: “There is the short-term concern about devaluation of the dollar in light of the increased amount of government spending and stimulus in response to the corona panic crisis.”

Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, told Cointelegraph that “a more sophisticated investor base has come to understand its [BTC’s] value as a non-sovereign, fixed supply, deflationary asset.” Meanwhile, Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, commented to Cointelegraph:

“These firms probably see Bitcoin as a hedge or insurance against current market conditions. [...] With these companies entering the markets, it opens the floodgates and establishes some form of confidence for the rest to follow.”

A longer-term worry

But COVID-19 distress may soon abate, or so one fervently hopes. This leaves “the longer-term critical problem faced by many companies with the diminishing yield they can get on their cash reserves by holding them in banks or treasury bonds,” according to Ammous. In the past, companies could hold their reserves in government bonds and be reasonably sure of outperforming the consumer price index (CPI) — i.e., inflation. But today, “there seems to be a growing segment of companies that no longer reasonably expect that into the future,” said Ammous.

Indeed, buried within Stone Ridge’s announcement was a call to banks and philanthropies to likewise make Bitcoin a principal component of their treasury reserve strategies. To that end, Stone Ridge was offering up the services of its New York Digital Investment Group unit, which holds a license from New York State to convert dollars into crypto and back again, along with core custody, financing, and Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer capabilities.

Moya cautioned that BTC remains a risky asset, though that could soon change: “Both Europe and America are struggling with the coronavirus, and investors are widely expecting governments and central banks to continue providing massive amounts of stimulus into the economy. BTC for now remains a risky asset and primarily increases in value when risk appetite is strong. Eventually, once the dollar resumes a steady downward trend, Bitcoin and other cryptos will attract some safe-haven flows alongside gold.”

Will Square lead the way?

Apart from what may or not happen with corporate treasuries, the Square Inc. investment could have reverberations. A $50-million investment in BTC may seem modest for a firm whose market capitalization now surpasses Goldman Sachs’, but most analysts expect that crypto investment will grow.

Square has been bullish on Bitcoin for some years now. Its Cash App service enables users to buy and sell Bitcoin, and some analysts believe other payment firms will now have to facilitate crypto investment in some form — or risk being left behind. It hasn’t escaped notice, either, that the younger generation, the Millennials, are especially keen on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

But apart from payment firms, could institutional investors and/or Fortune 500 companies follow Square’s lead as well? “Yes. This trend has moved from an ‘if’ scenario to a ‘when’ scenario,” according to Cappelli. Institutional investors, too, will have to find new ways to diversify their portfolios and maximize balance sheet returns. Meanwhile, BTC has risen 50% since the beginning of the year.

But only 18.4 million BTC are now in circulation, and supply could be a problem. “With only roughly 2.5 million Bitcoin left to be mined, many institutional investors will look at other cryptocurrencies for better upside potential,” added Moya.

Ease of access and options that meet diligence and compliance standards are also critical, said Cappelli, adding: “Institutions mainly want their digital asset investments to look and feel like other more traditional investments in their portfolio with everything from service providers to reporting.” It’s helped that over the past three years, many traditional players have entered the space “like Fidelity, NYSE, Bloomberg, the CME, Deloitte, KPMG, etc. They’ve all expanded their offerings to include digital assets and this trend is growing,” Cappelli told Cointelegraph.

This transformation won’t fail for lack of infrastructure, added Neo, who applauded the institutional-grade platforms that have been built by Fidelity and others. “We view education and regulations as among the most significant barriers” that large firms must overcome if they are to adopt crypto into their core businesses.

What is a significant investment size?

What could be considered a significant crypto investment for a large hedge fund or institutional investor? “Given the volatility and where the asset class stands today, we have consistently recommended a 50 BP (basis point)-to-2% allocation for suitable investors,” answered Cappelli. As Bitcoin and the overall asset class matures, that allocation could grow further.

Moya told Cointelegraph that hedge funds and institutional investors will be more likely to have around 1% exposure to cryptocurrencies. Publicly held corporations, for their part, “will be more interested in creating their own cryptocurrencies, but the regulatory battle that hit Facebook’s Libra project has demotivated many companies.” He added: “Eventually, a large company will take a decent-sized investment, and that should be enough to force other firms to follow suit.”

A strictly limited supply

Reflecting on the recent public-firm announcements, Ammous told Cointelegraph: “What was most interesting for me about the MicroStrategy and Stone Ridge purchases is that these are not companies that deal with Bitcoin as part of their core business, and yet they chose to place the majority of their corporate reserves in Bitcoin, not just a small fraction.”

“We believe that Bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” said Square’s chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja. “As it grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way.”

It was Satoshi Nakomoto’s vision that in times of crisis, governments would never resist the temptation to print more money — even at the risk of debasing their currency — so Bitcoin’s founder wrote into the cryptocurrency’s code a 21-million BTC limit. No more than that could ever be minted, and that appears to have served Bitcoin well in the time of COVID-19. As Ammous told Cointelegraph, “There seems to be a growing recognition that the strictly limited supply of Bitcoin gives it a good chance at maintaining its value well into the future.”",,https://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-etf-under-consideration-sec-jay-clayton-says-2020-10,"Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Jay Clayton.

Clayton is attempting to shed the SEC's image of being rigid about cryptocurrencies. The regulator approved its first securities registration for a company issuing crypto-tokens through a public offering in August this year.

""One of the problems we've had was [that] we got off on the wrong foot in this innovation,"" he said, adding that there were still members of the financial communties that favored a more unregulated approach.

The SEC has previously had to issue cease-and-desist orders to companies for conducting unregistered security offerings in the form of initial-coin-offerings (ICOs), a method of funding via cryptocurrencies.

Key Takeaways The codebase for Schnorr signatures and Taproot technologies were recently merged into Bitcoin Core.

The new technologies will enable cheap and private transactions, which may further benefit other technologies like Lightning Network.

Share this article

Bitcoin Core is relatively conservative, prioritizing simplicity and security over an abundance of features. That doesn’t mean the network is the same as it was back in 2009, however.

After the release of segregated witness (SegWit) in 2017, it was revealed this week that Bitcoin has two more major upgrades on the horizon. Schnorr signatures and Taproot will offer the premier crypto network improved scalability and privacy.

Schnorr Signatures

Understanding the benefits of Schnorr signatures requires knowing a bit about what a digital signature is and how it’s used in Bitcoin.

A digital signature is like using a fingerprint to access data on the blockchain. Think of it as something like Touch ID: if you want to control your phone, you need to prove it’s you, so you place a finger over a sensor for verification.

When you create a crypto wallet, you receive a private and a public key. The private key is like your fingerprint, and the public key is like your phone.

You can use the private key to authorize outgoing operations from your wallet, which is called “signing.”

Currently, the algorithm used for signing is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This mechanism was used because Schnorr signatures were still under patent and not widely available until after February 2008.

ECDSA provides similar functionality to Schnorr signatures, but overall it’s inferior. For instance, Schnorr signatures are more secure, can enable better privacy, and save space on-chain.

Now that this new signing mechanism is coming to Bitcoin, the network will enjoy a minimum of 15% improvement in space efficiency.

Imagine you received BTC from multiple addresses, and now you want to spend them in a single transaction. ECDSA would require you to sign each individual input you received. With Schnorr signatures, however, you could bundle these transactions into a single operation.

Having one signature to replace several reduces transaction costs because you occupy less space in the block.

Another benefit Schnorr signature offers is privacy. Just as you can sign several inputs all at once, you can also create a signature that will cover users’ inputs, effectively making a joined transaction. An outside observer won’t be able to see how many people signed the transaction, which obfuscates your actions.

Finally, Schnorr signatures can be used for faster network verification by allowing batched validation.

Taproot

You may be surprised, but Bitcoin has smart contract functionality. Although it’s much more primitive than what Ethereum offers, it still enables fast payment sidechains like Lightning Network.

The major issue with smart contracts is space inefficiency. Taproot helps to fix this while bringing privacy benefits along the way.

Not all Bitcoin addresses and transactions are equal. There’s a distinction between the addresses that start with “1” and “3,” for instance. Addresses that begin with “3” are scripts, meaning that they may be used by several people or implement segregated witness (SegWit) technology.

Taproot gets rid of this distinction. With it, all transactions look just like regular transactions from one person to another, no matter how many people participated and whether a smart contract was involved.

To illustrate, imagine a payment channel that Alice and Bob set on the Lightning network. Once they are done with their business, they need to close the channel and take their BTC.

Without Taproot, the channel’s closure would involve creating a bulky transaction, which would reveal a lot of details about what happened. With Taproot, this operation would appear as a regular transaction distributing funds to Alice and Bob, as if a third-party had sent them BTC.

Next Steps for Bitcoin

Adding code for Schnorr signatures and Taproot to the Bitcoin Core codebase is an important step towards their implementation. However, a substantial amount of time is likely to pass before they go live on the network.

The good news is that both solutions are backward compatible, which makes their implementation easier. All of the legacy features will remain in place, so it doesn’t harm the node operators and users if they accept the changes.

As it stands, there are two possible ways the implementation can go: BIP 8 and Modern Soft Fork Activation.

Both of them include a signaling period, during which miners can upgrade, but the latter has a six-month review process after activation.

Regardless of which solution the community chooses, neither of these technologies will be available immediately. Bitcoin is not famous for going fast and breaking things, and this time is no different. so good stuff has to wait.

Still, users can take comfort in the fact that Schnorr signatures and Taproot are nearly at the finish line.

But one investment that hasn't been phased by the coronavirus pandemic or heightened volatility is the cryptocurrency bitcoin. On a year-to-date basis, through Wednesday evening, Oct. 14, bitcoin was up just shy of 60%.

Why is bitcoin outperforming in 2020?

Why does bitcoin continue to outperform equities? For one, there's the idea of scarcity. Only 21 million bitcoin tokens can be mined, which creates a level of scarcity that pushes up the value of these digital tokens.

Another reason bitcoin has done so well is the expectation of a digital revolution. This is to say that bitcoin buyers believe the utility of paper money has come and gone. This could prove somewhat accurate with the pandemic highlighting the potential for physical cash to be a carrier of harmful germs. With the rise of peer-to-peer payment platforms, bitcoin looks to become the superior digital currency.

Bitcoin also benefits from its first-mover advantage in the cryptocurrency space. It was the first digital token to catch on with investors, and happens to be the largest on a market-cap basis by a significant amount (it's five times the size of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap). Today, bitcoin serves as the intermediary asset on a number of crypto investment platforms if you want to purchase a less-common token (i.e., anything not named Ethereum or Ripple).

Buying bitcoin could be a big mistake

But as good as bitcoin has been for investors in 2020, my blunt opinion is that it's a terrible investment. Here are 10 reasons you should avoid bitcoin like the plague.

1. Bitcoin isn't really scarce

First of all, bitcoin is only as scarce as its programming dictates. Whereas physical metals, such as gold, are limited to what can be mined from the earth, bitcoin's token count is limited by computer programming. It's not out of the question that programmers, with overwhelming community support, could choose to increase bitcoin's token limit at some point in the future. Thus, bitcoin offers the perception of scarcity without actually being scarce.

2. It has a utility problem

The king of cryptocurrencies also has a utility problem. To date, only 18.51 million bitcoin tokens are in circulation, with an estimated 40% of these held by small group of investors. Even considering the fact that fractional token ownership exists, roughly 10 million to 11 million tokens in circulation aren't going to go very far. For context, global gross domestic product was $81 trillion in 2017. Meanwhile, bitcoin has approximately $114 billion to $125 billion in tokens freely circulating and not held tight by investors. There's minimal utility here.

3. There's a low barrier to entry

Bitcoin may enjoy first-mover advantage at the moment, but the barrier to entry in the cryptocurrency space is especially low. All it takes is time and coding knowledge for blockchain -- the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions -- to be developed and a digital token to be tethered to the network. There's nothing unique about bitcoin's underlying blockchain that other businesses couldn't one-up.

4. Few (if any) tangible means to value bitcoin

Another beef with bitcoin is that there's no tangible way to value it as an asset. For instance, if you want to buy shares of a publicly traded company, you can scour income statements, its balance sheet, read about industrywide catalysts, and listen to management commentary from recent conference calls and presentations. In other words, you can make an informed decision.

With bitcoin, there is no tangible data for investors to wrap their hands around. There's transaction settlement times and total circulating token supply, but neither of these figures tells us anything about the value or utility of bitcoin.

5. Fiat currencies may work on blockchain

I believe investors are also placing their faith in the wrong asset. Over the long term, blockchain technology is where the real value lies. Blockchain can be used to reinvent supply-chain management and expedite overseas payments. But when folks are buying into bitcoin, they're gaining ownership in digital tokens with zero ownership of the underlying blockchain.

To build on this point, companies are also testing blockchain that's tethered to fiat currencies. For example, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) was awarded a patent in July 2018 ""for linkage of blockchain-based assets to fiat currency amounts."" This implies there may not be any need for a made-up digital token to be used at all on blockchain networks.

6. Blockchain is years from being mainstream

A sixth issue is that blockchain is still years away from gaining real relevance. Three years ago, when blockchain companies and cryptocurrency stocks were the hottest thing since sliced bread, it was expected that blockchain technology would be quickly adopted. Little did investors foresee the Catch-22 that would arise. Specifically, no businesses are willing to make the costly and time-consuming switch to blockchain without the technology being broadly tested -- yet companies aren't willing to make this initial leap to test the technology and prove its scalability.

In short, blockchain is years away from being a mainstream technology.

7. Fraud/theft is a serious issue

By no means are cryptocurrencies the only asset to be hacked by thieves, but there are serious fraud and theft concerns that accompany bitcoin. For instance, novice bitcoin investors may not understand the need to store their tokens in a digital wallet, thereby leaving them susceptible to theft by hackers.

Additionally, it's been hypothesized by numerous blogs and publications that North Korea has turned to bitcoin mining and theft to funnel money into its isolated economy. Bitcoin is commonly viewed as the ""currency"" of choice for criminal organizations.

8. There's no regulation

Bitcoin is also an unregulated asset. Though this lack of regulation is actually a selling point for today's crypto investors given that it provides some degree of anonymity, it's bad news if something ever goes wrong. Since the majority of cryptocurrency trading and transactions occur outside the borders of the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission is very limited in what it can do if your digital tokens are ever stolen.

9. The tax situation is a nightmare

If you think preparing your federal income taxes stinks now, try preparing them after investing in and/or using bitcoin in any transaction. The Internal Revenue Service expects you to report capital gains and losses tied to investment activity, as well as gains and losses associated with purchasing goods and services.

For example, if you bought a single bitcoin token at $11,000, then used a fraction of your bitcoin to buy a new smartphone for $1,000, you'd have to calculate the value of your bitcoin used at the time of the transaction and recognize capital gains or losses relative to your cost basis. It's a gigantic headache.

10. All bubbles eventually burst

Last, but not least, all next-big-thing investment bubbles eventually burst. No matter how excited investors are about bitcoin and its underlying blockchain, history suggests it won't be enough to match lofty expectations.

Mind you, we've already witnessed multiple 80%-plus declines in bitcoin throughout its history. Extreme volatility is a given with digital currencies like bitcoin, and history would suggest that significant downside from its current price is a near certainty as well.

We would like to add our perspective and thoughts on this, as we believe there is value to be derived from discussing these matters in depth. For better and worse, we believe that blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Handshake (in which I am involved) have features that make them a novel threat to the powers that states derive from currency issuance — but only a very marginal threat. This fairly mild conclusion flows from more controversial premises.

Steven McKie is a founding partner and managing director at Amentum Capital, developer on HandyMiner and HandyBrowser for Handshake and host of the BlockChannel podcast. A version of this article first appeared on Amentum's blog.

The New York Fed writers name three kinds of money: fiat money, money with intrinsic or commodity value and claim-backed money. Without getting lost in the weeds, we think this overcomplicates things. All money that we can think of falls into two categories: either it has intrinsic value (like edible grains) or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, then its value comes from the supposition that someone else values it.

This mysterious “someone else” might be totally unspecified, as when we suppose someone will pay us for gold; or it might include a specific party, such as a state, that promises to take the money in exchange for, e.g., discharging tax obligations. Bitcoin, like gold in the post-gold-standard era, falls into the former category. It has no intrinsic value and nobody in particular has promised to exchange anything for it. We just guess that someone will.

But we should not be surprised that the world’s most popular kinds of money are the ones that states explicitly promise to honor. For states, such promises are an extremely important instrument of their power. For example, by only accepting dollars as tax payment, the United States obliges its hundreds of millions of people to make sure they have dollars handy. Because of this, everyone in the world knows they can sell their dollars to someone (i.e., to U.S. residents). Moreover, everyone knows that by accumulating dollars they gain certain leverage over the United States. This situation enables the United States to print its own money and in so doing, project its power around the world.

The power to print money also gives states another kind of power: It enables them to maximize their productivity. By increasing the money supply, they can pull more people on the margins of the economy into the productive process. But this comes at the cost of the scarcity of money and, because it puts the newly minted money directly into the pockets of the less-powerful, tends to decrease the power of those who have already accumulated a lot of money. Hence, artificial constraints of the money supply, like the gold standard, are often associated with extremely conservative politics. Constraining the money supply hurts productivity, but it preserves social hierarchies.

This is where the more benign hopes of transcending nation-states mix with the darker fantasies of so-called bitcoin maximalists. On the one hand, a meaningful alternative to national currencies could allow people in abusive regimes not to rely on their governments’ worthless “promises.” On the other hand, a mechanistically fixed supply of money could put an unequal social hierarchy beyond the reach of democratic power, as the gold standard once did.

Bitcoin, in this respect, is very much like gold. And like gold, it poses no active threat to state currencies or state power. For the value of state currencies – as described above – is predicated upon the actual, practical power of states. Throughout modern history, the preeminent reserve currency has been the coin of the world’s preeminent military power. Only if states lose their status as the main global powers are their currencies likely to follow suit.

Cryptocurrencies are only playing around the margins of this reality. Still, they can play an interesting role because they have features that prior non-state currencies did not. For example, they can facilitate coordination and communication between their holders. Imagine if all the holders of gold could, for example, vote on whether to mine more. Moreover, some cryptocurrencies have intrinsic value, such as ether (paying for the use of a distributed network), or HNS (paying for domain names on a decentralized registry).

Improved diplomacy through incentives

The ongoing improvements in global cooperation that happen in the bitcoin/crypto private sector derive from the many players that ensure a proof-of-work (PoW) system remains secure.

The intricacies that go into the production of hashrate, such as power and chipmaker pricing negotiation, manufacturing, international sales and marketing, mining pools and hashpower secondary markets. All are playing a piece in hardening relationships locally and internationally.

Therefore, a properly secured chain has then worked its way into regional regulations and labor, becoming a localized economic staple over time as it approaches scale. And, the second-order effects that come from that embedded chain of incentives include a public blockchain that is secure, not just technically but socially and politically. The most secure chains possessing such widespread economies of scale become powerful economic instruments of finance and political social progress (albeit slowly, but each new major public chain hastens this emergent process, thankfully).

In essence, though these systems may at first seem adversarial to state power by their very design, if you look more closely you’ll see they inherently (slowly) improve diplomacy via scalable trustless cooperation and international business over time.

To understand more on the “alchemy of PoW hashpower” and how it naturally derives incentives for international business cooperation, see this ongoing series from Anicca Research. The trustless systems we deploy globally have powerful consequences, and it’s important that we as an industry understand how to continually scale the positive aspects of decentralized monetary systems, without amplifying the negative effects such as centralized financial influence.

States are not wrong to be somewhat threatened by these hard-to-assess possibilities. If many people decide they would rather hold cryptocurrencies than state-backed currencies, it will diminish states’ abilities to project power through their coins.",2020-10-17 15:00:00+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/monero-scales-10x-with-latest-upgrade/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Monero will undergo its latest upgrade beginning on Oct. 17.

The upgrade includes improvements to transaction times, transaction sizes, and minor security updates.

Monero remains the top-ranking privacy coin, though authorities are drawing attention to illegal uses.

Share this article

Monero will upgrade its network today, with the latest release of its node software, codenamed “Oxygen Orion.”

Performance and Security Improvements

This upgrade contains only one major change: a new ring signatures construction called CLSAG.

That feature will improve Monero’s scalability and performance. By some estimates, CLSAG will reduce transaction sizes by 25% and improve transaction verification times by 10%. This marks the project’s most significant scalability improvement since the project introduced bulletproofs in 2018.

The upgrade also includes a number of small security improvements, primarily concerning Dandelion++, which is responsible for hiding user IP addresses. The remaining changes are minor bugfixes.

Unlike in previous upgrades, there will be no change to Monero’s mining algorithm. That algorithm was frequently modified to disadvantage ASIC miners. However, the project’s October 2019 upgrade included RandomX, which means that the network no longer needs to change its mining algorithm for ASIC-resistance.

Monero Developments

Though not directly related to the upgrade, development on a community Monero project is progressing.

Since September, community developers have been working on an atomic swap that quickly allows users to exchange Monero for other coins. The proposal for the project has now reached full funding (2727 XMR or $300,000).

Meanwhile, Europol has drawn attention to illegal uses for the coin. This week, it recognized that “Monero is gradually becoming the most established privacy coin for Darkweb transactions,” and states that the coin is a “considerable obstacle” for investigators. That statement comes just weeks after U.S. government agencies, including the IRS and the DEA, revealed plans to trace Monero (though the effectiveness of those plans has been called into question).

In any case, Monero remains the top-ranking privacy coin. Its main privacy features remain uncompromised, and continual improvements will likely help it maintain its position in the future.

Correction: This article originally ran with the headline “Monero Scales Up 10x With Latest Upgrade.” The relevant part of the upgrade improves scalability by 10%, not 10x.

While some attribute this growth to the booming interest in decentralized finance among crypto enthusiasts, others see it as a bullish trend that confirms the inflow of fiat currency to the crypto ecosystem.

As the DeFi sector keeps growing, so too does the popularity of stablecoins, used to gain high returns from various decentralized lending projects. Stablecoins are also useful for their ability to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and digital assets. Stablecoins started off the year on a high note, as their cumulative transactional volume surpassed the $90 billion mark in a financial quarter for the first time ever. Although Tether (USDT) still holds the lion’s share of the stablecoin market, Dai and USDC indeed saw growth during 2020.

From conception of the first stablecoin in 2012 with the proposal of the Mastercoin project as a way of tying cryptocurrencies to traditional assets to mitigate price volatility, developers have grown accustomed to using the U.S. dollar as a go-to stable asset.

Currently, however, developers are experimenting with other stable assets such as gold, other fiat currencies and even cryptocurrencies. Here is an updated look on the current state of stablecoin adoption as a list of the top performing stablecoins in the market.

USD-pegged stable coins

Tether (USDT)

Like every other stablecoin, Tether was designed to enable investors to store profit from crypto trading on a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. To quote the website: “Every Tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.” This means that for every USDT coin, there is an equivalent $1 in the company’s reserve. Currently, Tether is the most popular stablecoin, with a market capitalization of over $15 billion and a daily trading volume exceeding $40 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.

Despite claims by Tether’s issuing company that the tokens are 100% backed by liquid reserves, in the past, numerous parties have raised doubts about the company’s claims. But controversy aside, the number of USDT in circulation has recently increased from slightly over $4 billion in circulation at the start of 2020 to a whopping $15 billion. Most experts believe that DeFi has been a huge contributor to the mass-minting of USDT.

Furthermore, the rapid growth of USDT’s dominance has seen the coin overtake giants payment platforms like Bitcoin and PayPal in terms of average daily transfer value, at over $3.5 billion. With its increased popularity, Tether now plans to migrate a majority of its supply to faster networks, as the Ethereum network continues to experience increased gas fees.

USD Coin (USDC)

Issued by Circle, a blockchain-centric financial services provider, USD Coin was launched in 2018 as a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio. In terms of the stablecoin’s transparency, Circle claims on its website that USDC reserves are monthly audited and published for the public by top accounting services.

Like Tether, USDC has seen rapid growth, with an increased circulation above $1.8 billion in the past six months. Just recently, Centre (a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase for the development of management of USDC) announced the expansion of USDC from Ethereum to additional blockchains. The move is set to ensure that USDC remains flexible enough for large-scale financial innovations emerging among DeFi projects.

Paxos Standard (PAX)

According to its website, Paxos, the company behind the PAX Standard stablecoin, says that its stablecoin is the most liquid and well-regulated in the world. With its listing in over 150 exchanges, PAX boasts of over $100 million in daily trade volume and a total of $2 billion minted PAX coins in circulation.

Like its peers, PAX is packaged as a digital dollar that can be used to move money swiftly across the globe and at any time. The stablecoin is built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 protocol, and customer’s funds are held in segregated accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Binance (BUSD)

Launched via a partnership between one of the biggest crypto exchanges and Paxos, Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin has so far received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. This allows other financial institutions in the NewYork area to custody BUSD without needing prior custody licenses from the NYDFS.

In a race toward establishing itself as the go-to stablecoin for DeFi applications, Binance USD just recently launched on Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain. Through its partnership with Dapper Labs — the team that pioneered crypto games such as Crypto Kitties — Binance USD is expected to open doors for developers looking to build stablecoin-powered DeFi applications. The BUSD is also quite popular on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a smart contract-enabled blockchain designed to accelerate the development of DeFi protocols.

Thanks to Binance’s market dominance, BUSD has had one of the most explosive growth rates, with a market cap that grew from about 20 million at the start of the year to its current mark above $500 million.

TrueUSD (TUSD)

While Tether is criticized for its centralized management and lack of transparency, TrueUSD claims to do the very opposite. TrueUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin based on the TrustToken Platform, and claims to run on a transparent ethical code that provides the public with real-time proof of funds stored in an escrowed bank account.

Not even the TrueUSD team has access to the escrow account, as in place of a managing team, smart contracts are put in place to help maintain the peg between the U.S. dollar and the TUSD coin at 1:1.

In March last year, TrustToken partnered with an accounting firm to develop a dashboard that enables third parties to view TUSD in circulation with the collateralized fiat funds.

Apart from TrueUSD, the TrustToken platform is also home to stablecoins backed by other national currencies including the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Hong Kong dollar. All of them were launched in 2019 and are mostly actively traded on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange that hosts a variety of DeFi protocols.

Part two: Projects pegged to other national currencies

XSGD Stablecoin

On Oct. 5, Xfers, a Singapore-based payment company, launched a Singapore dollar-pegged XSGD stablecoin. As the first Singaporean dollar-denominated token, XSGD creators expect that the coin will provide both businesses and individuals a means of exposure to the crypto industry.

To ensure easy access, the token can freely be withdrawn and transacted, even with noncustodial wallets. Also, given that the stablecoin claims to be compliant with the Financial Action Task Force’s travel rule, financial institutions can use it for cross-border money transfers as well. Like most stablecoins, the team behind XSGD is pushing for the token’s adoption within the DeFi ecosystem, with it currently being available on Ziliswap and Uniswap.

While speaking to Cointelegraph, Aymeric Salley, who heads the project, said: “Now is the time for stablecoins pegged to other national currencies such as the Singapore Dollar to emerge.”

Saga (SGA)

Saga, a U.K.-based blockchain company, has launched a stablecoin alternative to Facebook’s Libra in late 2019. Similar to Libra, SGA maintains its stable value by being tied to a basket of national currencies. What sets Saga apart from the Libra proposal is that the value of the SGA token is pegged to bank deposits in the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights. The IMF’s special drawing rights is a basket of assets that are heavily weighted in the U.S. dollar as well as the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound sterling and Japanese yen.

Additionally, unlike Libra, Saga will not profit from the stablecoin, although it will act as the primary issuer of the token. While speaking to CNBC, Saga’s founder Ido Sadeh Man said that the stablecoin’s objective is to act as a complementary currency for cross-border payments, in that consumers would use it to make a payment on ecommerce platforms such as Amazon. Due to its lack of regulatory clarity, Saga is currently unavailable in the U.S. and Israel.

EURS

Backed by the euro, the EURS stablecoin is issued by Stasis, a blockchain-related company that aims to tokenize traditional assets. The company claims that it pulls together various licensed financial intermediaries, including accounting firms and law firms, to ensure compliance and stability of its tokenized assets.

The EURS stablecoin was launched in June 2018. Built on Ethereum’s streamlined EIP-20 standard, EURS was pioneered as the first euro-backed stablecoin, and also boasts of providing continuous transparency through daily statements of its liquidity providers. So far, EURS has issued nearly 32 million coins, with a daily trading volume sitting slightly above the $1million mark.

Monerium

Monerium is a fintech company founded in 2015 that hopes to simplify access to digital currencies. The company launched its first stablecoin in January 2019 after a $2 million seed round led by Crowberry Capital, with the participation of ConsenSys and Hof Holdings.

Monerium’s digital currency is designed such that the digital equivalent of major fiat currencies is issued to customers who can customize their currency basket. Monerium claims to be decentralizing finance by enabling open regulatory and technical standards to support its stablecoin. Currently, Monerium’s services are available across all EU member countries, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and the U.K.

Can stablecoins outshine other currencies?

The reported increase in the overall supply of stablecoins has left many market watchers confused. If analytics from Coin Metrics are anything to go by, April 20 was the first time the number of stablecoin in circulation passed the $9 billion mark. Some analysts argue that the increased supply of stablecoins is a bullish signal as people hedge their positions. Others believe that it’s a bearish signal of people exiting the crypto space.

However, this growth in stablecoins comes at a time when various jurisdictions are also starting to warm up to the idea of creating their own stablecoins. As calls to tokenize traditional assets continue, newcomers into the stablecoin market, such as XSGD Stablecoin, are bound to become commonplace.

With increased volatility, more developers will keep an eye on the developments happening among stablecoins to create financial innovations that mitigate volatility. The question now is whether stablecoins like Tether will overshadow the utility of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as cross border payment protocols, as well as the fiat currencies they are pegged to.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/uni/trader-claims-uniswaps-uni-will-plunge-to-2-00-prior-to-platforms-v3-launch/,"Uniswap’s UNI token has been struggling to garner any sustainable upwards momentum over the past few days and weeks, with each rally being met with massive inflows of selling pressure that force its price lower.

There are no immediate catalysts for it to see any significant upside, as it will still be quite some time before any governance proposal is put forward and passed to distribute fees to holders, and there’s no definitive date for when V3 of the platform will be released.

Until either of these two events take place, it remains unclear as to when the cryptocurrency will be able to see any sustained upwards momentum.

One narrative that could bolster the cryptocurrency in the future is the regulatory clampdown and series of hacks seen by centralized exchanges as of late.

The $150m KuCoin hack a few weeks ago directed a spotlight onto the risks incurred by holding capital on centralized platforms. The recent arrest of the OKEx founder – which resulted in 200,000 BTC being locked within the platform, further bolstered the case for DEXs.

Despite this growing narrative, one analyst believes that Uniswap’s UNI will continue plunging lower in the days and weeks ahead, potentially hitting the lower-$2.00 region.

Uniswap’s UNI Struggles to Gain Momentum as Selling Pressure Mounts

Directly following the recent news of OKEx’s crypto withdraws being suspended, Uniswap’s token price rocketed higher, signaling that investors anticipated this news to provide DEXs with a boost.

It has since surrendered these gains and is currently trading down marginally at its current price of $3.00.

It does appear that a break below the $3.00 support level is imminent, which could kick off a fresh bout of selling pressure.

Analyst: UNI Likely to Plunge Towards $2.00 Before Rebounding

One analyst explained that he believes a move to $2.00 is imminent for Uniswap’s UNI.

However, he does note that the token could get a near-term boost if Yearn.finance decides to switch strategies from Curve to Uniswap in the near-term.

“UNI I’m shorting everything above $3.2. Alpha leak: Expecting YFI to change strategy from CRV to UNI long before UNI v3 launch,” he said.

Unless there’s some catalyst that shifts its near-term trend, Uniswap’s UNI will likely continue drifting lower in the near-term.

OKEx, one of the industry’s largest crypto-fiat exchanges, suspended all cryptocurrency withdrawals, saying one of the exchange’s keyholders has “been out of touch” with the exchange because he is “currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.”

Coming hard on the heels of the BitMEX indictments from a couple of weeks ago, this surely will focus the market’s attention on the security of the withdrawal protocols of large exchanges.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

At the time, concerns surfaced withdrawals might be halted from BitMEX, one of the largest derivatives exchanges in the industry. The withdrawal protocol needed a certain number of authorized signatures, and one of the authorized signatories had been arrested. The concerns turned out to be unfounded and withdrawals continued without a hitch but the possibility, combined now with OKEx’s reality, highlights how unique is crypto asset market infrastructure.

Traditional market-infrastructure businesses are not exempt from regulatory risk. But in traditional markets, customers don’t deposit their funds directly on exchanges; they do so via brokers. Even if a broker were to go bankrupt, for instance, segregation of funds means the broker’s bank could return funds to clients.

Crypto markets don’t work that way. Brokers are not yet a feature, and customer funds are usually held by the exchange platform. When it comes to crypto holdings, there isn’t even a bank that can take over at the behest of the authorities to return funds.

This also highlights the irony that an industry born with a decentralized ethos is dominated by centralized businesses, with centralized vulnerabilities. While exchanges often have multi-sig protocols in place (which allowed BitMEX’s withdrawals to proceed even when one signatory was unavailable), it appears that not all do.

And while traditional markets have participants operating in lightly regulated jurisdictions, these businesses do not dominate their market segment, as they do in crypto.

Another issue it raises is that of jurisdiction. OKEx is based in Malta, which is part of the European Union, but headquartered in Hong Kong. After CoinDesk’s initial report came out, Chinese media reported that the founder Star Xu had been released from police custody in Shanghai. The exact charges are still unclear, and the company has said in an emailed statement they have nothing to do with OKEx. Rumors (not yet corroborated) have surfaced that it is to do with money laundering – were they to be true, which jurisdiction should press charges, and to what extent should Malta be involved?

Chinese media also reported the detention of Xu was the result of an investor dispute over forced liquidations, a systems crash and OKEx’s handling of the situation. The company has claimed it is not aware of such a problem.

What’s more, the corporate structure of OKEx is frustratingly confusing – Xu is also the founder of OKCoin, which is based in San Francisco, as well as the CEO of OK Group and, according to his LinkedIn profile, he’s also based in San Francisco. Some reports say Xu was not detained by the police, that he had asked for their protection. Others say he was detained two weeks ago and has not been since. OKEx maintains that Xu no longer represents the firm, which was spun out from OK Group earlier this year. This leaves unexplained the suspension of withdrawals.

By the time you read this, more news will probably have emerged to clarify the legal situation and the withdrawal schedule. Or perhaps we’ll be even more confused. Meanwhile, the company insists customer funds are safe.

This situation highlights both the relative immaturity of crypto markets as well as how far they’ve come. It reminds us the markets are still immature in that on many systemic platforms there are still relatively few customer protections in place. The market is still largely retail, which has fueled the growth of platforms that do not meet the rigorous compliance and accountability requirements of institutional investors.

Yet, this also reminds us of how far crypto markets have come in terms of resilience and adaptability. The bitcoin (BTC) price initially fell just over 2% on the news, less than the almost 4% drop on the back of the BitMEX indictment news on Oct. 1. As I type, it shows signs of holding steady in the $11,300-$11,350 range.

Looking forward, developments like this will accelerate a trend that has already started: the growing interest on the part of centralized exchanges (not just in the crypto industry) in decentralized applications. Earlier this week, at our invest: ethereum economy event, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao repeated that he sees decentralized finance, or DeFi, as a complement rather than a competitor to the more traditional structure.

Indeed, the price of $UNI, the token of the decentralized liquidity provider Uniswap, initially fell on the shock of the news but then rebounded almost 15% as investors started thinking through the potential impact.

Source: CoinGecko

Meanwhile, tokens issued by more centralized crypto exchanges such as Binance (BNB) and FTX (FTT) fell by 5% and 3%, respectively, and at time of writing have yet to rebound.

It’s not often you get to watch market infrastructure dynamics shift before your very eyes. But, as we say in our industry, a year in crypto is like 10 years in traditional finance.

The crypto market is broader and more interesting than most realize

We had our first Ethereum-focused event this week, which brought together investors, analysts and builders from all corners of the industry to discuss the second-largest crypto ecosystem by market cap, and its upcoming technology change.

I hosted a panel of crypto market-infrastructure leaders to talk about the financial off-chain aspects of Ethereum – its markets, traded products, investors and outlook. We didn’t have time to go into all that I would have liked, but here are some of the key takeaways:

Ethererum is becoming an on-ramp

Bitcoin is still the main crypto asset on-ramp for investors, as it is the most liquid and has the greatest number of venues and trading opportunities. Yet, according to Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investments (like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Capital Group), a growing number of traditional investors are attracted by the potential of decentralized finance and Ethereum’s value proposition as a platform for innovative market applications. Its ETH currency is becoming an on-ramp.

The growth in ETH investors can be seen in the number of addresses with a non-zero balance, which is up almost 40% since the beginning of the year.

Volatility is a feature, not a bug

Many investors cite volatility as a barrier to crypto asset investment. Some regulators use it as an excuse to limit access for retail investors who may face unexpected risk. Indeed, crypto assets are more volatile than most traditional assets – but that is more a feature than a bug.

Both Sonnenshein and Thomas Chippas, CEO of crypto asset platform ErisX, pointed out their client bases represent a wide variety of investment strategies, including risk arbitrage trades. This is no doubt a feature across the market, as traders and quant funds search for greater volatility than they can find in traditional markets since, harnessed well, it can provide superior returns. The growth of liquidity in the crypto derivatives market, both in volumes and in range of products and maturities, shows that hedging strategies are becoming more sophisticated, which enables return-enhancing volatility trades.

The institutions are already here

The “great wall of institutional money” that some crypto market commentators were breathlessly awaiting a couple of years ago did not materialize. But that does not mean “the institutions” aren’t already here.

All three panelists acknowledge that crypto markets are still largely retail, but that institutional investors are playing an increasing role in liquidity and in shaping the development of market infrastructure.

Grayscale Investments, whose clients are mainly institutional and professional investors, announced earlier this week its best quarter ever, with over $1 billion raised in three months, more than four times the amount for Q3 2019.

Also this week, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) released a report that shows over $1.1 billion of institutional money flowed into the industry in the form of venture capital investments. And JPMorgan published an investment note on bitcoin for its institutional clients.

A growing ecosystem in terms of maturity and opportunity

Overall, the event highlighted that the crypto asset ecosystem is about so much more than bitcoin. While that may be the largest and most liquid cryptocurrency, the innovation, building and emerging structure around other crypto assets such as ETH, is bound to attract attention of a broader range of investors – not just those who want to diversify their crypto holdings (ETH has outperformed bitcoin so far this year, +194% vs +60%), but also those who take the time to understand the value proposition of alternative assets as individual opportunities.

In other words, investors will increasingly come to realize crypto assets are much more than an alternative asset group. They are a collection of compelling ideas that respond to unusual market dynamics to create a unique opportunity to witness not only the birth of a new type of value exchange, but also the emergence of new valuation techniques and portfolio strategies.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

As if proof were needed that crypto markets can move fast, the healthy outperformance shown in the chart below was reduced in a matter of minutes when crypto exchange OKEx announced an indefinite suspension of withdrawals (which might have been restored by the time you read this).

With that price dip, which was relatively muted compared to what it would have been a year ago, say, we still have markets moving in a steady band, awaiting further signs of vaccine/stimulus optimism, or pandemic/recession/inflation pessimism.

CHAIN LINKS

At our invest: ethereum economy event this week, CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey chatted with Heath Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), about the regulator’s view on Ethereum and its asset, ether. TAKEAWAY: What stuck out from the conversation was how much thought Chairman Tarbert has put into Ethereum and its potential applications, as well as the upcoming technology shift to Ethereum 2.0. Among the takeaways to keep an eye on:

Staking yields could perhaps be considered income, which could make ETH a security, although this would be the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The decentralized nature of the Ethereum network is a factor in that equation, and could push the classification towards that of commodity.

He was surprisingly accepting of the idea that decentralized finance will disintermediate the financial system from traditional players.

Enforcement actions against crypto exchanges are likely to continue as long as there are exchanges flouting U.S. laws. Chairman Tarbert sees this as necessary for the U.S. to lead in digital assets.

A report by PwC shows the dollar amount of crypto M&A deals in H1 2020 exceeded the amount for all of 2019. Also, the average size of private equity investments grew from $4.8 million in 2019 to $6.4 million in the first half of 2020. TAKEAWAY: Not only is the report illuminating in terms of the number of deals done – where the deals are concentrated is also interesting. The uptick in deals involving crypto asset exchanges and trading companies reveals a growing interest in crypto asset market infrastructure, which signals that institutional investors expect institutional investors to show even more interest in the industry.

Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments’ reported Q3 figures, which showed investment inflows of over $1 billion vs. $255 million in Q3 2019. TAKEAWAY: Not all of this inflow is new institutional money, as many investors recycle their investments – they sell in the market when the lockup expires (now at six months) at a significant premium, and then re-invest the proceeds in new trust share issuance. Still, the figure is representative of institutional interest, and indicates significant growth in demand for bitcoin as an investment.

The Ethereum Trust managed by Grayscale Investments has become a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company, a move that increases the trust’s transparency – and potentially its liquidity. TAKEAWAY: This potentially increases the trust’s liquidity by reducing the mandatory holding period for qualified investors from 12 months to six. It will also increase transparency around the funds flowing through the investment vehicle, per SEC filing requirements.

Investment bank JPMorgan issued a research note on bitcoin that stressed the “vote of confidence” from Square’s recent treasury purchase of $50 million worth of BTC, and the payments company’s growing revenue from crypto asset sales. TAKEAWAY: The analysts seem to be focusing more on demographic sentiment and corporate precedent than fundamental valuations, which is itself a notable shift from other investment bank-sponsored reports. Could it be that traditional finance is finally getting that fundamentals are not the only value drivers?

Institutional asset manager Stone Ridge Holdings Group has purchased 10,000 BTC as a “primary treasury reserve asset,” which it is holding with its crypto subsidiary NYDIG. TAKEAWAY: This adds to the list of non-crypto companies using bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement. Emphasizing the vote of confidence in the ecosystem that this represents is NYDIG’s new $50 million funding round, backed by Fintech Collective, Bessemer Venture Partners and Ribbit Capital.

Bitcoin’s hashrate (an indicator of how much computing power is dedicated to maintaining the Bitcoin network) rose to a record high this week. TAKEAWAY: Remember the Bitcoin halving, just five months ago, when the miner subsidy of new bitcoin was cut by 50% and some predicted that mining would become unprofitable for many? This would then theoretically weaken the network’s security by centralizing mining power in the hands of a few large pools that could enjoy economies of scale. Well, rather than dwindle, it continues to climb. This shows that mining costs are coming down largely due to lower energy prices and more efficient machines. It also shows that the network’s security depends on more factors than just the bitcoin price (which determines the value of the miner subsidies) – technological changes also matter.

The report pointed out that DeFi tokens have been following Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s (ETH) price movements. DeFi assets have recovered over the past seven days, the report confirmed.

It noted:

“Outperforming BTC, tokens such as Ren Network’s REN, Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) have surged 10 percent over this time span.”

But other DeFi crypto-assets such as Yearn.finance’s YFI and Compound (COMP) are both down about 5% during the past week. They’re underperforming Bitcoin and their DeFi peers. YFI had been trading for around $14,500, which is around 15% more than last week.

OKCoin’s crypto market report noted:

“The average DeFi token underwent a strong bounce this week, outperforming Bitcoin’s 7.5% rally and Ethereum’s 10% rally. Tokens such as REN, LINK, and AAVE are up by dozens of percent in the past seven days, while tokens such as COMP and YFI have slid 5–7%.”

The report also mentioned that CFTC Chairman Heath P. Tarbert had stated that he’s “impressed” with the innovation taking place in the Ethereum (ETH) space. As confirmed in the report, further developments took place with layer-two scaling solutions – which are designed to improve the throughput rate of blockchain-based crypto networks.

OkCoin also noted in its report that it’s currently preparing to list three new digital currencies, including Chainlink (LINK), DFI.money’s YFII, and YF Link (YFL).

As stated in the report:

“On-chain analysis by the head of DTC Capital Spencer Noon suggests that the fundamentals of Ethereum and DeFi are stronger than ever despite the correction in the market. Trends showing strong fundamental growth in the space include DeFi protocols being on track to collect $500 million in annualized revenue, the number of DeFi users reaching 600,000, and decentralized exchanges transacting more ethereum than centralized exchanges.”

The report further noted that Curve Finance, a stablecoin-focused non-custodial exchange, will be working on a layer-two scaling solution. Curve will be collaborating with Matter Labs, which is a development firm focused on creating “a trustless scalability and privacy engine for Ethereum.” Matter Labs’ main product is Zinc Alef, a layer-two solution developed on Zero-knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups).

Curve is notably the first app launched on Zinc Alef’s testnet. Users can test swapping between USDC and USDT stabelcoins through the exchange “at effectively no cost and with transactions that take seconds, not minutes,” the OKCoin team noted.

The report also mentioned that Synthetix has launched the second phase of its Optimistic Ethereum testnet trial. Optimistic Ethereum is an Ethereum scaling solution developed by Optimism that makes use of Optimistic Rollups.

As explained in the report:

“Rollups are a technology where cryptography is used to migrate transactional throughput to a second-layer solution where users can send coins and interact with contracts at a much lower fee than the main blockchain… [Currently,] the only application on the Optimistic Ethereum testnet is Synthetix’s Mintr staking platform. Optimism is attempting to onboard other protocols, though porting applications over to Optimistic Ethereum from Ethereum isn’t as easy as copy and pasting contract code.”

The report added:

“This second phase will trial migrating SNX from layer-one Ethereum to layer-two Ethereum. The phase is also important because the project will allow more users to try out this new solution.”

People in Turkey are increasingly turning to bitcoin as the local currency, the Turkish lira, recently hit another record low against the dollar. Bitcoin adoption in Turkey outshines other countries in the region.

Turkey Is Regional Leader in Bitcoin Adoption

Bitcoin adoption has been increasing in Turkey as the local currency, the Turkish lira, hit another record low Thursday, reportedly touching 7.95 to the dollar. The dollar has gained about 33% against the lira so far this year and some analysts are predicting that it will soon hit 8.5. “The Turkish lira is getting smoked” and “will crash to new lows due to ‘unorthodox’ policies,” CNBC reported analysts explaining. “The lira’s underlying problem is the lack of credible inflation targeting by the central bank, which is bound to ultimately debase the currency,” Commerzbank analyst Tatha Ghose wrote in a note to clients last week.

The country has been suffering from high inflation and the unemployment rate is past 14%. Steve H. Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University and a hyperinflation expert, said Turkey’s annual inflation rate is at 36.57% and climbing. “The lira is toast,” he tweeted Sunday. “Turkey is burning through its foreign exchange reserve like a house on fire,” the professor continued, noting that its reserves currently stand at $41.12 billion, down almost $10 billion since July.

Experts attribute Turkey’s high adoption of cryptocurrencies to economic uncertainty in the region and the extremely volatile lira. Ray Youssef, CEO of global peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace Paxful, said Thursday:

The rising inflation of the Turkish lira has been a major financial burden for Turkish citizens. Bitcoin can be used to preserve wealth against instability surrounding the Turkish lira.

Paxful also revealed Thursday that new registrations on its platform in Turkey increased 274% over the past 12 months. The company says it is seeing “massive potential for crypto adoption” in Turkey, which is why it is expanding its footprint in the country. Paxful has formed strategic partnerships with local cryptocurrency companies: Turkish lira-backed stablecoin Bilira (TRYB) provider and cryptocurrency trading platform Cointral. “We hope that by entering into the market we will be able to ease some of the financial burdens of its citizens,” Youssef remarked.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’ Geography of Cryptocurrency report, published in September, highlights how Turkey leads in cryptocurrency adoption in the Middle East. The report states:

Turkey is the highest-ranking country in the region on our Global Crypto Adoption Index at 29th overall, and also accounts for the most total transaction volume in the region.

Chainalysis’ global cryptocurrency adoption index ranks 154 countries. Besides Turkey, the countries with high adoption of cryptocurrencies in the Middle Eastern region are Iran (52nd) and Egypt (64th).

The top cryptocurrency exchange service providers in Turkey are Paribu, Btcturk, FTX, Huobi, Binance, Kraken, and Bitmex.

While Turkey currently has no cryptocurrency regulations, the country’s Capital Markets Board is developing a framework to oversee the cryptocurrency markets, with the goal to eventually enact regulations, the report details. Islam is the most practiced religion in the country. According to the government’s estimates, about 99.8% of the Turkish population of over 84 million people is Muslim. Recently, a shariah expert says that cryptocurrencies are legit commodities.

This signals that institutional investors could be building up positions as they expect the price to move higher in the future.

Along with spot purchases, institutional investors’ participation in the derivatives market has also increased. Data from Arcane Research shows that a record number of investors are taking delivery of Bitcoin from the Bakkt Bitcoin exchange.

Another metric that can be useful for traders is volatility. Bitcoin options data shows that the implied volatility of at the money options has dropped to a 16-month low. This suggests that traders do not expect a large down move in the near future, hence, they are not willing to pay a greater amount to hedge their positions.

Although data suggests that institutional investors are positioned for an upside move, retail traders should keep a close watch on the price action and take large bets only after a trending move starts.

Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could start a trending move next week.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding above the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,137) for the past few days. The buyers purchased the dip to the $11,165 support on Oct. 20, which suggests accumulation at lower levels.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BTC/USD pair could retest the $11,719 resistance. A breakout of this level may resume the up-move with the first target at $12,000 and then $12,460.

Both the short-term and the long-term moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is above 61. This suggests that the bulls are in control.

This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the next support at $10,500.

The 4-hour chart has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $11,165. This bearish setup has a pattern target of $10,611.

However, if the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, the bearish pattern will be invalidated. Such a move could attract short covering by the bears, resulting in a rally to $12,000.

The gradually upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggests a minor advantage to the bulls.

XLM/USD

Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below the 200-day simple moving average ($0.077) on Sep. 21 but the bears could not capitalize on this move and sink the price below $0.066841. This shows buying by the bulls at lower levels.

XLM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The XLM/USD pair has formed an ascending channel and the bulls are attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.084584. Although the bears defended the overhead resistance on Oct. 17, the bulls have not given up much ground.

If the pair stays above the moving averages, the buyers will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.084584. If they succeed, the pair could start a new uptrend that may rally to $0.10.

The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.

The pair had broken above the channel but the bulls could not clear the hurdle at $0.084584. However, on the downside, the bears have not been able to drag the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.079239.

This suggests that the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, a rally to $0.091042 will be on the cards.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to $0.076546 is possible. A break below this level could result in a decline to the support line of the channel.

CRO/USD

The descending triangle completed on Oct. 14 when Crypto.com Coin (CRO) plummeted and closed (UTC time) below the $0.144743 support. This bearish setup has a target objective of $0.10607.

CRO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the bulls might attempt to defend the 200-day SMA at $0.121. A bounce off this level could retest the breakdown level at $0.144743. In a downtrend, traders sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA ($0.144) as the path of least resistance is to the downside.

Hence, if the CRO/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is bearish. The sellers will then again try to sink the price below the 200-day SMA. If they succeed, the decline could extend to $0.10607.

The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI has plummeted deep into the oversold territory, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears. However, a relief rally cannot be ruled out in the short-term.

The RSI on the 4-hour chart has also plunged deep into the oversold territory. This suggests panic selling and usually, after such a round of such intense selling, a minor pullback occurs.

Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the 20-EMA as bears will try to consolidate their advantage.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rises and sustains above the breakdown level of $0.144743. Until then, every rally is likely to be viewed as a selling opportunity.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from $31.9798 on Oct. 16 but the bulls purchased the dip to the immediate support at $29.5646. This suggests that the previous resistance level has now flipped to support.

BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($29.06) and the RSI above 61 indicates that bulls have the upper hand. The 200-day SMA ($19.95) has also started to turn up, which suggests that the long-term trend is also tilting in favor of the bulls.

If the buyers can thrust the BNB/USD pair above the $32– $33.3888 resistance zone, the momentum could pick up and a retest of the all-time highs will be on the cards.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the pair below the 20-day EMA, it will signal weakness.

The bears are defending the $31–$32 zone aggressively. The flattened 20-EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.

This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $29.5646. If this support cracks, a drop to $28 and then to $26 is possible.

Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above the overhead resistance zone, it will signal the resumption of the uptrend.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) is attempting to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $51.50. The flat moving averages and the RSI below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.

LTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the long tails on the candlesticks on Oct. 2 and Oct.16 show that the bulls are buying the dips to the trendline. If the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the LTC/USD pair could again rise to $51.50.

A breakout and close (UTC time) above this level could start a new uptrend. The pattern target of the reversal setup is $61.50.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the trendline. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.

The 4-hour chart shows that the rebound off the trendline is struggling to sustain above $47.7845. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. The 20-EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone.

Therefore, the bears may take one more shot at breaking the trendline support. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $42.

Conversely, if the bulls can sustain the price above $47.7845, a move to $50 and then to $51.50 is likely.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rips-and-cruise-ships-bad-crypto-news-of-the-week,"It’s been a good week for the crypto markets. Bitcoin finally burst through the $11,000 ceiling, and kept going. According to some experts, the coin could be on its way to a full 2017-style bull run. Other analysts have identified five events that could move the markets this week, including the election’s effect on the dollar, Europe’s struggles with Brexit and the coronavirus, and Bitcoin’s high hash rate.

The investment experts at Stone Ridge Asset Management have been paying attention. After executives had made personal investments in cryptocurrencies, the company created a billion-dollar spinoff with a $115 million investment in Bitcoin. Square has been just as forward-thinking. The payments company has now put 1 percent of the company's assets—about $50 million—into Bitcoins.

The growth in crypto’s popularity has led some people to speculate that crypto banks are likely to overtake fiat banks within the next three years. In Italy, the banking system is trying hard to stay ahead. Some 100 banks there now use the blockchain network Spunta to speed up data transfers and settlements. In China, the city of Shenzhen gave away $1.5 million worth of a digital currency controlled by the country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China. And the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange is continuing to roll out regulated payment options for customers in the UK.

Closer to home, things are… well, a bit more cautious. The G7 has said that it will oppose Facebook’s Libra project until more oversight is in place. And Elon Musk has denied that his Tesla Gigafactory has Bitcoin ATMs.

In the world of DeFi, things are looking more fluid. Chainlink might be about to lose its leadership of the ecosystem. Competition is heating up. Constellation Network is building a DeFi project on its Hypergraph protocol and has announced the support of early backers, including FBG Capital and Alphabit Fund.

Cornell University has revealed that the most downloaded dissertation over the last eight years is Adem Efe Gencer’s proposal for Aspen, an algorithm for spreading the workload over a peer-to-peer network. (If you’re looking for a good place to read that paper, you can do worse than choose the crypto cruise ship Satoshi. It will soon be moored in the bay of Panama.)

That certainly rounds off a good week.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.funds-europe.com/etf-report-2020/digital-gold-the-untapped-potential-of-cryptocurrency-etfs,"Largely led by fund manager VanEck, the development of ETFs exposed to bitcoin and similar cryptos is hindered by regulatory challenges. This has created a realm of untapped potential. Alex Rolandi reports.

For many asset managers, investing in cryptoassets such as bitcoin or ethereum through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or similar vehicles is unknown territory in more than one sense.

Crypto markets remain fragile, and blockchain-based digital currencies present a whole new regulatory landscape to navigate for ETF strategists. Volatility – which can often be extreme – is another factor to contend with.

Investors who bought into bitcoin at its inception and held on to it would have seen their investment surge, but with a number of drawdowns along the way. This includes a drop of more than 90% in 2011 – the worst decline recorded, apparently – according to researchers at crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital.

Data from Morningstar shows the number of global ETF products has more than doubled in ten years, exceeding 7,400 at the end of August, but there are still very few cryptoasset ETFs or similar vehicles. In the US, none have been approved by regulators, while in Europe, none are eligible for Ucits funds either.

New York-headquartered VanEck has been trying to get a cryptocurrency ETF-like proposal off the ground for some time now in the States. From the offset, regulation has stood in the way.

In September last year, the firm pulled the plug on a bitcoin offering it planned to launch in conjunction with the software development and financial services company SolidX. The fund manager’s chief executive, Jan van Eck, has since said that a bitcoin ETF in the United States is a long way from becoming available.

Embracing volatility

For Dominik Poiger, a Frankfurt-based ETF project manager at VanEck, the fact that regulators are scrutinising the asset class, and asking questions such as how companies can guarantee protection for their clients’ assets, is only natural.

“Cryptocurrencies trade 24/7 and aren’t regulated. It’s a completely new asset class and difficult to understand,” he tells Funds Europe. “You have to be really careful.”

At the same time, the ETF trader believes that holding on to bitcoin long-term is enough to watch the initial investment grow, highlighting how it has outperformed many other asset classes. He questions what value active management can add. “There are multiple studies asking if active really is outperforming, and it’s not. I would presume that this tendency also applies to cryptoassets or bitcoin in general – hold on to it and wait,” he says.

This view is backed up by the data. According to ETF specialist WisdomTree’s head of capital markets for Europe, Jason Guthrie, allocating to the cryptocurrency through a passive and systematic approach should ultimately lead to returns.

“For example, a 1% target weight, rebalanced at regular intervals, would have historically managed to harness bitcoin’s unique return profile, benefiting from sharp and sudden price appreciations in the asset, with a limited increase in volatility,” he says. This results in a material improvement of the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio, he adds.

From an investment point of view, VanEck’s Poiger argues, the key is to embrace cryptocurrencies’ volatility. “We see bitcoin as a form of digital gold,” he says.

Looking at the bigger picture – and how bitcoin has performed against traditional asset classes since its creation, and has served as a diversifying asset – its volatility becomes irrelevant, he says.

One commentator – financial services firm deVere’s chief executive Nigel Green –recently argued that within a generation, bitcoin will overtake gold as the go-to safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty. Millennial and Generation Z investors, Green said in a statement, “can be expected to go for bitcoin and other digital currencies instead”.

Mining alternatives

The largely untapped potential of cryptoassets could be a digital goldmine for fund managers seeking further diversification in this ongoing environment of sky-high stock valuations and low, or even negative, bond yields.

“Money is being printed like never before, but bitcoin’s monetary policy cannot be manipulated,” says Poiger.

According to WisdomTree’s Guthrie, who believes there is space for both active and passive management in the crypto area, even a small allocation to bitcoin can help improve a risk-adjusted portfolio.

“Despite showing a propensity to fall alongside other assets in times of intense market stress like we experienced back in March, bitcoin’s correlation remains low with traditional asset classes and alternative strategies over longer time frames,” he says.

WisdomTree launched its own physically backed passive bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) last year, listed on the Swiss stock exchange SIX. At launch, the firm’s head of Europe, Alexis Marinof, said that there was enough evidence to conclude that digital assets like bitcoin are “not a passing trend” and can play a role in portfolios. This is especially important given current investment circumstances.

In Switzerland, Dr Mattia Rattaggi, board chairman of boutique crypto specialist Ficas, believes traditional asset classes are saturated. “There’s a sense that we’ve reached the peak in these areas,” he says. “This is the proposition for diversifying: because other asset classes are exhausted.”

In July, Ficas unveiled what it claims is the first actively managed cryptocurrency ETP. Also listed on SIX, the product operates in a regulated environment, but is not actually regulated or supervised by the country’s financial authority. “Otherwise it wouldn’t be an ETP,” notes Rattaggi.

Mitigating risk

Using a discretionary approach, he explains that the strategy trades bitcoin against other top-15 coins and moves to fiat currencies when this is deemed the best option, depending on movement in the markets. It means that investors in the ETP, available only through banks and brokers, are not overly exposed to the risk associated with cryptocurrencies, he says.

The portfolio’s management relies on fundamental analysis to try and avoid the infamous dips seen in cryptocurrencies. Working with the right custodians also plays a key part in guaranteeing a level of security for investors.

The launch came about against a backdrop of increased demand for diversification and alternative assets. The cryptocurrency strategy’s assets under management have since grown by around 50% to over three million Swiss francs (€2.8 million), according to the firm.

“Setting it up was a challenge as we were venturing into unchartered waters, but this was part of the endeavour,” says Rattaggi.

The fact that Switzerland is already a “crypto nation” facilitated the process, he adds. “There has to be an element of open-mindedness to innovation.”

For VanEck in the US, it would be a different story. But VanEck’s Poiger says there is no way around the fact that bitcoin and other cryptoassets are becoming increasingly relevant.

Investing in cryptocurrencies through ETFs and similar products can act as a non-correlated diversification tool for both institutions and retail investors. Having the right expertise is paramount, however.

“The uncorrelated asset and diversification effect has become clearer to more and more investors – they just need to have patience,” says Poiger.

Unlike Poiger, Ficas’s Rattaggi believes active management is a “very appropriate way forward” for cryptoasset ETFs in order for them to function well. While passive investing may be the best approach for traditional asset classes, because markets are already efficient and well-structured, this is not the case for crypto markets, he says.

Entering the cryptocurrency space through a passive vehicle, or without the necessary knowledge base, leaves investors at the mercy of the market, Rattaggi argues. It could blow up in their face and they could lose everything – meaning deep knowledge or a strong algorithm is crucial.

Given how uncharted this territory is, there are likely to be many ‘firsts’ in the cryptoasset ETF space over the coming years as technology improves and regulation evolves.

Established fund manager Fidelity Investments rolled out its cryptocurrency business in Europe last year to help European institutions invest in digital assets. Called Fidelity Digital Assets, the business is intended to offer clients access to custody and trade execution services for digital assets and an institutional-grade solution for bitcoin access, including vaulted cold storage.

More developments like this will surely follow that could, eventually, provide the right basis for cryptocurrency ETFs.

Since then the cryptocurrency’s price went up to trade at $11,500.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, moved from $360 at the start of the week to a $390 high, before its price dropped back down. At press time it’s trading at $376.

Cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments released its financial report for the third quarter of the year this week. The document revealed that it raised $1.05 billion from investors, making it the “largest capital inflow in a single quarter in the firm’s history.”

The report details that Grayscale’s bitcoin product, GBTC, led investment demand with inflows of $719.3 million in Q3 2020. The trust’s assets under management grew 147% year-to-date. So far this year, the firm has seen investors put over $2.4 billion into its family of products, equivalent to “more than double the $1.2 billion cumulative inflow into the products from 2013-2019.”

According to Grayscale’s report, institutional investors accounted for 81% of the investment in Q3, and investors broadened their exposure to cryptoassets during the quarter, as 57% of the funds came from investors with exposure to various Grayscale products. Its assets under management are now $6.4 billion.

Stone Ridge Holdings Group, a $10 billion asset manager, announced this week bitcoin would serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The firm bought over 10,000 bitcoin,m at press time worth over $110 million, as “part of its treasury research strategy.” The move came after an announcement from MicroStrategy revealing the firm invested $425 million into bitcoin, purchasing 38,250 BTC.

MicroStrategy’s investment did not end there, however.r The firm owns a number of premium domains, including Courage.com, Glory.com, and Strategy.com. It redirected one of these. Hope.com, to a page dedicated to giving users educational resources on BTC.

Square, the payments firm founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, also bought $50 million worth of BTC earlier this month. The move was touted as a “strong vote of confidence for the future of bitcoin” and a signal that the payments company sees “a lot of potential” in BTC as an asset by JPMorgan analysts.

While institutions are seemingly increasingly betting on bitcoin, early adopters are moving their funds under the hood. Data from the Bitcoin blockchain shows that so far this year over 2,000 bitcoins from the so-called “Satoshi era” were moved.

But it appears Satoshi ERA coins are on the move now?! https://t.co/scOwEuGsoP Since this post another 50 have moved. Anyone know what's going on? — Paul McNeal #BTC20K 🚀 🔥🏳️‍🌈 🧢 (@_CryptoCurator) October 11, 2020

The term “Satoshi era” refers to the period in which Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was still active in the community. Satoshi left the crypto space in December 2010. Most of the movements simply included wallet changes, although 9.99 BTC ($114,500) were donated to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), while another 9.,99 went to the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER).

Cryptocurrency exchanges’ reserves were also in the spotlight this week. San Francisco-based Coinbase is estimated to have over $11 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in its wallets, making it a risk for the market in case the funds ever end up in the wrong hands. OKEx, which has $2.2 billion worth of BTC, froze withdrawals as one of its private key holders is “out of touch” with the exchange while cooperating with authorities in an investigation.

Hackers Face Pushback in Crypto

Belgium’s financial watchdog Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) estimated Belgian investors lost 10 million euros ($11.8 million) between May 2019 and September 2020. In a report, the FSMA attributed the losses to fraudulent platforms including cryptocurrencies.

A separate report indicated that hackers have stolen over $22 million worth of bitcoin from Electrum wallet users by pushing fake updates via pop-up messages to those running old versions of the cryptocurrency wallet.

While hackers have been running rampant in the cryptocurrency space so far, some companies are starting to push back. This week crypto exchange Binance revealed it helped at least one investor recover $30,000 from a cryptocurrency scam.

The exchange froze stolen funds deposited onto its platform, and sent them back to their rightful owners. The exchange called on others in the space to help stop bad actors.

The crypto platform is proving itself to be the first-choice for developers, drawn to its flexibility and its fast-growing community.

Recent reports have claimed Polkadot saw a 44 per cent increase in developer activity for the 12 months ending in May, while Bitcoin and Ethereum both saw modest declines. Blockchain gaming, crypto wallets and security solutions are among the projects already making use of the Polkadot platform.

One of the main ways that Polkadot differentiates itself from other crypto platforms is that it doesn’t operate apps through smart contracts, instead allowing developers to build their own blockchains. Polkadot’s decentralised relay chain allows independent blockchains to exchange information with one another, whether they are public or private.

Connecting the dots

“Polkadot is a network protocol that allows arbitrary data—not just tokens—to be transferred across blockchains,” the Polkadot website explains. “This means Polkadot is a true multi-chain application environment where things like cross-chain registries and cross-chain computation are possible. Polkadot can transfer this data across public, open, permissionless blockchains as well as private, permissioned blockchains.”

Polkadot has been created by British programmer Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum and the man behind some of the core components of the blockchain industry. The new platform has already raised millions of dollars through a combination of public and private funding, while its own Dot tokens have surged in value.

Although Polkadot is still only trading at a fraction of the value of Ethereum and Bitcoin, its popularity with developers is certainly noteworthy. And as the industry continues to develop, the demand for easy-to-use, secure crypto platforms will only grow.

Via Outlier Ventures",2020-10-19 10:41:17+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/exploring-the-landscape-of-crypto-regulations-in-sub-saharan-africa,"Sub-Saharan Africa has no doubt suffered many regulatory setbacks in adopting cryptocurrencies. With most countries in the region struggling not to buckle under economic uncertainties and pressures looming over them even as the ripple effects of COVID-19 set in, it would appear that many Africans, especially millennials, aren’t waiting for the government anymore.

The main issue inhibiting regulation seems to be a combination of resistance and indecision both from regulators, which has majorly been a result of little or no understanding of cryptocurrencies.

Speaking to Cointelegraph on the attitude of regulatory bodies in Africa toward cryptocurrencies, Andrew Nevin, partner and chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers Nigeria, said:

“I think it’s fair to say that around the continent, people are being cautious. There’s been a lot of problems with cryptocurrency and various kinds of fraud: initial coin offerings and projects that didn’t have sufficient value and have gone backwards or folded up. So, I think that the authorities are taking the right view in taking this step by step.”

For the most part, governments of most sub-Saharan countries have not taken any clear stance toward cryptocurrencies.

The waiting game

Many African governments pretty much don’t know what to do about cryptocurrencies, although recently, there has been some progress. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria has officially defined digital assets under its regulatory umbrella in a recent statement. Before, the Nigerian Central Bank had flip-flopped, going from warning its citizens against doing business in digital currencies to launching research on potential policy proposals. In Kenya, authorities have gone from comparing cryptocurrencies to pyramid schemes to setting up a task force to study the challenges and benefits associated with the underlying blockchain technology.

Over the years, the legality of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets has varied significantly across the region, with over 60% of African governments yet to make their position known.

While some nations have openly declared their support for cryptocurrencies, most countries have either issued complete or partial bans. The most common position, however, is one of caution. Countries such as Kenya, Ghana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe have warned its citizens about cryptocurrencies without actively banning crypto trading or use. Other countries such as Namibia and Burundi, while also not banning usage, have issued bans against trading, citing lack of consumer protection.

Similar to what we see in Kenya, a statement from the Ugandan government referred to “One Coin Digital Money,” as a cryptocurrency alongside Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC) and XRP, among others, putting them all on equal footing as cryptocurrencies. OneCoin was a notorious multilevel marketing scheme that allowed “representatives” to earn incentives from selling memberships for an enterprise with no genuine product.

Taking a critical look at these countries, we could infer that Ponzi schemes have tainted the reputation of legitimate crypto projects and may be slowing things down. Paxful CEO Ray Youssef spoke with Cointelegraph on the subject. Paxful is a leading peer-to-peer crypto exchange platform that has the highest growth of P2P trading in Africa so far by providing on-ramps and off-ramps for cryptocurrencies within the region:

“We ought to understand that regulators are just starting to figure cryptocurrencies out. Many of them have just begun their exploration and they hear about this in the worst possible ways, especially in Africa. Because nine out of 10 people you talk to in Africa have been scammed in a cryptocurrency-involved scam or know someone who has been scammed. That’s a huge number, but then you consider the proliferation of multi-level marketing scams that operate upon Africa like OneCoin, this infamous Ponzi [...] plus the crypto mining scams. Everyone in Africa has been scammed.”

Youssef also added that corruption ranks as one of the factors slowing down the regulation of cryptocurrencies within the region:

“Unfortunately in Africa, things are a little different from in the West. Everyone wants to wet their beak a little bit at the table, and that’s how regulators think [...] and that’s a challenge for people in the African crypto space.”

Possible catalysts to speedy regulation

Despite the regulatory weakness, it has become obvious that the region has seen a continuous increase in interest in cryptocurrencies. Countries such as Nigeria constantly rank first in online searches for “Bitcoin” as seen on Google Trends. A Sept. 10 blockchain analytics report from Chainalysis indicates that Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya cumulatively lead the continent in monthly crypto transfers, which totaled $316 million in June.

Africa’s interest in crypto could also likely be fueled by factors, such as worsening inflation, high remittance fees, low financial inclusion and political instability, among other factors, which, in turn, have made things difficult for the average person in sub-Saharan Africa. These would hasten the decisions of regulatory bodies in the future.

Hyperinflation

Inflation rates across the continent have historically been much higher than the global average. An extreme example would be Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation, which led Zimbabweans to a desperate search for a store of value even as the pandemic has increased economic uncertainties.

High remittance fees

This is another factor that could hasten the decision of regulators, as they already have a growing market. According to a report from the World Bank, remittances worth less than $200 to sub-Saharan countries cost an average of about 9% compared to a global average of 6.8%, while payments between countries cost even more. For example, sending money from South Africa to Zambia costs 18% of the value of the money sent.

Political instability

Not only does political instability exacerbate inflation and currency volatility, but it can also result in forced migration, GDP collapse and wealth confiscation, all of which lead to an intensified search for sound money to preserve wealth. This increased attention would, in turn, hasten the hand of regulatory bodies to make a decision. According to data from the World Bank, just 10 of Africa’s 53 nations have a positive score on the political stability index.

The challenges of hyperinflation, high remittance fees and economic instability are more pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa than other parts of the world. These issues put more financial pressure on the average citizen — pressure that makes regular people search for options for a safer financial future. Faster response from regulators can, therefore, be linked to the astonishing increase in the people showing interest in cryptocurrencies, which are now seen as an escape route from the harsh realities facing most Africans.

The situation in various countries within Africa is similar, as they mostly fall under regulators that are undecided when it comes to crypto. Most countries within sub-Saharan Africa have wavered. Below is an overview of what regulations in some of the largest crypto markets in sub-Saharan Africa feel like so far.

Nigeria

In a recent report, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria officially issued regulatory guidelines for digital currencies and crypto-based companies or startups. According to Nigeria’s capital market and investment regulator, the aim is to protect investors and create standards for ethical practices. The commission also added that it will regulate “all Digital Assets Token Offerings, Initial Coin Offerings, Security Token ICOs, and other Blockchain-based offers of digital assets within Nigeria.” Every crypto asset in Nigeria will be treated as securities unless the company or startup can prove otherwise. This development is a far cry from what was obtainable before now.

In 2017, the commission had taken a more antagonistic approach. It warned citizens to be cautious while investing in cryptocurrencies, as they might experience “financial losses” without guaranteed protection from the regulatory body. That same year, Nigeria’s central bank warned local banks against doing business in digital currencies. Meanwhile, the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country has brought with it a rise in bad actors seeking to exploit unsuspecting citizens.

However, it’s likely that interest in crypto from its citizens may have driven Nigerian regulators to latch on to this budding market.

South Africa

Before Nigeria, South Africa had been the sub-Saharan jurisdiction most receptive to cryptocurrencies. In December 2014, the South African Reserve Bank put out a paper stating its position on virtual currencies. The SARB affirmed that it alone has the right to issue any legal tender and that decentralized convertible virtual currencies don’t constitute legal tender in South Africa. The SARB stated, “Only the Bank is allowed to issue legal tender i.e banknotes and coins in RSA, which can be legally offered in payment of an obligation and that a creditor is obliged to accept. Therefore the decentralised convertible virtual currencies are not legal tenders in RSA.” This was confirmed again by the SARB in its statement in 2017 as it confirmed that it does not recognize cryptocurrency as “currency” or “legal tender” in South Africa.

Continuing the trend of inconsistency, however, the Minister of Finance in South Africa distributed authority over crypto beyond the SARB. The Minister noted in mid-2017 in Parliament that “the National Treasury together with the SARB, [Financial Intelligence Centre], and [Financial Services Board] also established an Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group in December 2016, to develop an approach and revised policy stance towards fintech, including crypto-currencies.”

The country has been trying to affix a pro-crypto stance recently, as seen in a policy paper released by South Africa’s Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group, financial regulators in the country recommended “that crypto assets remain without legal tender status” in a roadmap outlining what could become the nation’s first comprehensive crypto laws.

Zimbabwe

Though many of the nations of sub-Saharan Africa have changed their attitude toward crypto recently, Zimbabwe has seen perhaps the most striking thaw in recent years.

The government banned crypto in 2018. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe instructed the private banks of Zimbabwe’s largest virtual currency exchange, Golix, to close its accounts and made Golix itself refund its customers.

Nonetheless, peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies continues to grow in Zimbabwe as the country’s monetary policies falter. In mid-2019, the crypto rush in Zimbabwe reached such a high that rumors about Bitcoin’s price reaching a 600% premium began to spread.

In its monetary policy statement from February, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe revealed that its focus was on stabilizing its currency. Having suffered massive hyperinflation that peaked in 2007, the bank appears intent on eradicating the volatility of its exchange rate through the establishment of a currency stabilization task force. According to the RBZ, exchange rate stabilization will result in a corresponding decrease in inflation, thus leading to significant economic recovery for the country.

Consequently, Zimbabwe has made somewhat of a U-turn in its crypto policy. A local news source reports that the RBZ is reportedly developing a regulatory sandbox for cryptocurrency companies in the country.

Other parts of Africa

For other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the situation seems to be pretty much the same. As regulators take their time to wrap their heads around this technology and how its implementation can influence the dynamics of their economic scene, citizens are seeing it as a haven for reasons ranging from remittances to hyperinflation.

As of last year, Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed that cryptocurrencies were still unregulated, issuing a public warning to investors in March 2019. Meanwhile, the regulatory space for cryptocurrencies in Kenya is currently nonexistent, with only a warning from its regulator for individuals and organizations to steer clear of transacting in digital currencies.

What the future holds for Africa

For the most part, the neutral regulatory stance on crypto in most countries within sub-Saharan Africa is due to a lack of education. However, it appears that this will not remain so for much longer. The level of interest from its citizens is growing. Beyond the need to hold cryptocurrencies for speculative reasons, Africa seems to be the region with the greatest need for cryptocurrency use cases. This increasing demand will play a key role in hastening regulation across the continent. With Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria, newly involved in the space, we may be about to witness a cascade of regulation from other parts of sub-Saharan Africa.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/81667/fincen-mixing-service-helix-fine-bitcoin,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said Monday that it had assessed a $60 million penalty against Larry Dean Harmon for the years-long operation of bitcoin ""mixing"" services and violations of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act.

Harmon was sued in February by the U.S. Department of Justice for operating Helix, which allegedly catered to dark net marketplace participants. According to documents published Monday by FinCEN, the agency ""identified at least 356,000 bitcoin transactions through Helix between June 2014 and December 2017.""

Per FinCEN's statement:

""Mr. Harmon, doing business as Helix and Coin Ninja, operated as an exchanger of convertible virtual currencies by accepting and transmitting bitcoin through a variety of means. From June 2014 through December 2017, Helix conducted over 1,225,000 transactions for its customers and was associated with virtual currency wallet addresses that sent or received over $311 million dollars. FinCEN’s investigation has identified at least 356,000 bitcoin transactions through Helix. Mr. Harmon operated Helix as a bitcoin mixer, or tumbler, and advertised its services in the darkest spaces of the internet as a way for customers to anonymously pay for things like drugs, guns, and child pornography. Mr. Harmon subsequently founded, and acted as Chief Executive Officer of, Coin Ninja, which operated as an unregistered MSB and in the same manner as Helix.""

""FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Mr. Harmon willfully violated the BSA’s registration, program, and reporting requirements by failing to register as a MSB, failing to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, and failing to report suspicious activities,"" the agency continued.

According to the FinCEN documentation, Helix denied in communications with the agency in March that it was a money services business.

There have been no court updates on Harmon's DOJ-filed case since February, according to data from Court Listener.

As The Block's Steven Zheng previously wrote, Helix was connected to Grams, a so-called ""Google of the Dark Web.""",,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/10/19/crypto-fans-rejoice-bitcoin-rallies-to-the-brink-of-12000,"The world’s largest digital currency rose as much as 3.4 percent on Monday to about $11,835.

Bitcoin’s biggest rally in more than a week has pushed it to the brink of $12,000, a key level watched by chartists and technicians.

The world’s largest digital currency rose as much as 3.4% on Monday to around $11,835. Crypto fans are closely watching the $12,000 level as a major hurdle to cross before it can embark on a bigger rally.

The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks some of the largest digital coins, also rose, gaining 4.5% at one point. Dash and Monero were among the biggest advancers, each rising more than 5%.

On Monday, the International Monetary Fund hosted a virtual panel on cross-border payments and digital currencies which featured BIS General Manager Agustin Carstens as well as the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, among others. Powell said the central bank is evaluating the costs and benefits of a digital currency but has not decided yet on whether to issue one. He also nodded to Facebook Inc.’s Libra as a catalyst for focusing more attention on the issues.

The discussion at least partly helps explain Bitcoin’s move higher as it was closely watched by the crypto community, said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics.

“Comments from Jerome Powell and the other participants made it clear just how far apart the various countries are when it comes to CBDCs,” said Greenspan, referring to central bank digital currencies. “Many on social media were quick to point out that a truly global and decentralized digital currency already exists.”

The coin’s trading Monday also helped it buck a recent trend of moving in tandem with U.S. equities, whereby it was often rising when they were and falling on risk-off days. The S&P 500 Index dropped as investors weighed the latest progress on a new government spending bill meant to help shore up the economy.

Many analysts remain bullish on the cryptocurrency, heartened by its limited supply and comforted by greater institutional acceptance in recent weeks. Square Inc., for instance, said earlier this month that it has made an investment of about $50 million in Bitcoin.

“We see Bitcoin emerging as a relative oasis of calm and outperformance,” wrote Mike McGlone, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, in a note. “There should be little doubt technology and digitization will continue advancing, yet Bitcoin’s supply will keep shrinking, supporting its price.”",2020-10-19 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitstamp-adds-crypto-crime-insurance-for-assets-held-online,"Disclosure

OKEx founder Xu Mingxing was taken at least a week ago and hasn't appeared in a work-related social media group recently, according to a person close to the company. It's not clear what the investigation is about. There have been signs of a renewed crackdown on money-laundering activities on over-the-counter (OTC) trading platforms of cryptocurrencies.

The suspension of withdrawals was because one of the exchange's private key holders is cooperating with the public security bureau in an ongoing investigation, OKEx said in a statement. Two persons close to OKEx told Caixin that the key holder is Xu, a tycoon who has a hands-on management style for the company's finances, one of two persons said.

A private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or her cryptocurrency. When dealing with cryptocurrency, a user is usually given both a public key and a private key to send and receive coins, but he or she won't be able to withdraw them without the unique private key.

The exchange said it has been ""out of touch"" with the key holder, preventing authorization of transactions. The security of customer assets ""will not be affected"" by the event, the exchange said.

OKEx CEO Jay Hao said on Sina Weibo that the decision to temporarily suspend withdrawals was due to personal issues of the private key holder.

This is not the first time Xu has been in trouble. In September 2018, he was detained by the police amid a dispute with investors who had huge losses on his bitcoin exchange platform OKCoin.

Many investors complained that on Sept. 5, 2018, when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged by nearly 10%, OKCoin's platform crashed, causing significant losses for many investors who traded cryptocurrency futures on the platform.

An OKEx seller told Caixin that ""scrutiny has been tightened recently."" For OTC transactions, buyers are required to provide screenshots to regulators of their payment accounts within a week to assist identification and account verification, the seller said.

OKCoin, together with other China-based bitcoin trading platforms, closed their Chinese mainland trading operations and moved offshore after Chinese regulators issued an edict in August 2017 forbidding fundraising through initial coin offerings.

Xu then founded OKEx and registered it in Malaysia. According to OKEx's website, the exchange's operators are based in Malta and the Seychelles.

OKCoin and OKEx still keep offices in Beijing and Shanghai and allow domestic investors to trade cryptocurrencies through OTC trading. Users can buy popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT from OKEx-verified merchants in a way similar to e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, the exchange said on its website.

OKEx ranks 11th among cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap.

The World Gold Council, a major market development organization for the gold industry, released a report on retail gold insights in Russia on Tuesday.

According to the report, cryptocurrency is currently the fifth-most popular investment tool in Russia after savings accounts, foreign currencies, real estate and life insurance. As part of the World Gold Council's rankings of Russian investments made in the past 12 months, cryptocurrency is followed by gold, accounting for 17% and 16%, respectively.

The report is based on a survey of 2,023 online interviews with investors from cities across Russia. The respondents are “active investors” — those who made at least one investment in the 12 months preceding the survey.

According to the report, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) remain popular in Russia and benefit from being an accessible investment tool. In the meantime, gold has not yet established itself as a mainstream investment asset due to a lack of education and trust.

The World Gold Council also noted that the crypto investment trend in Russia comes despite digital assets being a relatively risky investment, while gold has historically emerged as a stable investment for the long term. This could be a sign of growing demand for new investment products, the World Gold Council suggested, stating:

""The rise of cryptocurrencies demonstrates that there is a desire for choice and appeal among retail investors. As the Russian investment market takes shape, opportunities for different investment products will emerge and gold will need to respond.”

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,910 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.8% over the previous 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,673-$12,058

Bitcoin’s price continued to make gains Tuesday following Monday’s steady price appreciation. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency breached $12,000 around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET), going as high as $12,058 before settling in at $11,910 as of press time.

The last time bitcoin was over $12,000 was back on Sept. 1, according to Bitstamp spot pricing. (CryptoCompare, using index-weighted pricing, puts it at Aug. 19.) David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, says bitcoin could hit $12,500 at some point soon but will face a struggle. “The real resistance level is around $12,500-ish, so until a meaningful breakout above that level, nothing is done, $12,000 is just a psychological level.”

Lifchitz said that while the price level is notable, it could lead to bitcoin staying in a sideways pattern around this level similar to when it crossed $10,000. “Bitcoin, having held above $10,000 for more than two months in a row, was a bullish sign, even if it had been trading sideways in a $2,000 range.”

Nevertheless, the last time bitcoin traded below $10,000 on the spot market was back on Sept. 9. This piece of data appears to be bolstering some investors’ faith.

“We continue to break the record each day for the longest streak a bitcoin trades above $10,000, so overall investor confidence is growing I think,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Assets.

Bill Noble, cryptocurrency strategist for analysis firm Token Metrics, said momentum is shifting from Ethereum-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, to bitcoin. “ETH and DeFi are watching BTC awaken like a sleeping giant,” he said. “The BTC move to $12,000 is sending the altcoin universe scrambling for cover.”

Bitcoin dominance, a metric that calculates the cryptocurrency’s share versus other assets on the market, has been trending up since the start of October. The last time dominance was at this level was at the end of August.

“Although there is positive sentiment around BTC, bull runs usually lead to a bear market in alt coins,” noted Melvis Langyintuo, a market strategist for the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.

Market conditions may mean DeFi discounts could develop for traders, Token Metrics’ Noble noted. “A BTC move above $12,000 could result in a DeFi dip that could be bigger than most expect,” he said. “Any such move could be a golden opportunity to pick up the survivors of the DeFi shakeout at discounted prices.”

Ethereum fees get cheap – for now

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Tuesday trading around $369 and slipping 2.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

On Saturday, Oct. 17, the daily average fee on the Ethereum network hit a three-month low, at 0.00246199 ETH. That’s a level not seen since July 12 when the average was 0.00211437 ETH. Fees, which are trending back up from Sunday’s low, are required on Ethereum to send transactions, including to smart-contract based DeFi platforms.

Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, an investment firm that has followed cryptocurrencies since 2014, said deflation of DeFi hype is causing fees to go down. “Gas fees are lower as the recent enthusiasm for DeFi tokens, [decentralized exchanges] and [automated market makers] has hit a wall for now,” Bonnefous told CoinDesk.

If DeFi heats up again, expect higher fees, Bonnefous added. “We could be in for a few weeks of consolidation before another push higher for DeFi tokens, which will most likely see gas costs flaring again. The problem of high gas fees won’t go away without structural enhancements.”

In the past too, incidents of wealthy businessmen losing their money through fake crypto wallets have come to light

Since September, several reports in Indian media outlets have highlighted incidents of unsuspecting customers being allegedly duped of their money through crypto ponzi schemes

Even as crypto stakeholders in India argue against the perceived need for an outright ban on cryptocurrencies in India, reports of crypto ponzi schemes in different parts of the country continue to puncture their cause.

Since September, several reports in Indian media outlets have highlighted incidents of unsuspecting customers being allegedly duped of their money by scamsters believed to be operating crypto ponzi schemes.

In Bengaluru, the police are investigating three companies — Long Reach Global, Long Reach Technologies and Morris Trading Solutions. According to the police, these companies collected at least INR 15K each from over 11 lakh people from across the country to invest in a new cryptocurrency called Morris coin. The police have also arrested a 36-year-old man from the Malappuram district of Kerala who is the CEO of all the three entities.

Last month, Delhi Police was investigating an alleged cryptocurrency exchange scam, believed to have been operated by one Pluto Exchange, which marketed itself as a cryptocurrency investment firm and had its offices in Connaught Place. One of the complainants was asked by one of Pluto Exchange’s founders to invest in a new cryptocurrency that the firm had launched. The complainant was assured that he would receive 20-30% returns on his investment.

After investing about INR 5 lakhs in the scheme but not receiving any payout, the complainant tried to approach the company’s officials, only to find that the exchange’s office had shifted from India to Dubai. In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the 43 complainants had invested close to INR 2 Cr in the scheme.

In the past too, incidents of wealthy businessmen losing their money through fake crypto wallets have come to light. Such platforms target users through emails and SMSes, asking them to deposit their bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies in a “new” crypto exchange to get the opportunity to trade with other users globally. Once users have deposited their crypto assets in the exchange wallet, the operator shuts down the portal, with the users losing access to their crypto earnings.

According to data quoted by cryptocurrency news platform Cointelegraph, between 2017 and 2019, Indian investors have lost more than $500 Mn in cryptocurrency scams operated within the country and abroad.

Amid continued speculation about a ban on cryptocurrencies in India, scant government regulation and no clear law for cryptocurrencies in India contributes a great deal to motivating scamsters in the space. Further, a lack of awareness about digital currencies amongst the public is also a factor. While there is a case to be made about scamsters in the space soiling the name of several genuine and well-meaning crypto exchanges trying to pioneer a crypto revolution in the country, scamsters’ potential for stitching elaborate frauds under the guise of running a crypto exchange can’t be ignored either.

Besides ponzi schemes, other notable modes of crypto scams include fake altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin) being made available at attractive prices on certain crypto exchanges. Those who find bitcoin and the popular cryptocurrencies expensive are drawn to these altcoins, only to find that the new coin isn’t a genuine cryptocurrency, something that’s sooner than later discovered by the relevant authorities. Such fake coins are routinely removed from circulation. However, by the time that happens, millions of dollars worth such fake coins have already been sold to users.

The easiest way to identify a crypto scam is to realise when “offers” and “assured interest returns” on an unheard-of cryptocurrency sound too good to be true.

Sumit Gupta, the founder and CEO of Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, has said in the past that the surging popularity of cryptocurrencies in India would only give rise to more such fraudulent schemes.

To guard against such frauds, Gupta suggested that users should conduct their due diligence before working with cryptocurrencies. This can be done by finding out whether the mobile app for the crypto wallet is linked to an official website for the platform. Further, users should peruse other users’ comments, reviews and feedback for the app on the internet and the Google Play Store. The number of users and downloads are other important metrics to go by before trusting a platform.

The most important factor in judging a crypto scheme’s authenticity still rests in judging whether schemes promising implausible returns can ever come through. While crypto enthusiasts and seasoned traders will always stay clear of fraudulent schemes, those new to the ecosystem can do well with internet-based research before depositing their money in new platforms or buying new cryptocurrencies.

Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School, may be an outlier in the debate, but he says the Financial Conduct Authority’s ban on retail investors’ trading derivatives based on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether could be emulated in the U.S. The FCA oversees financial regulation in the U.K.

Hockett told CQ Roll Call the restrictions could be a first step in preventing another financial crisis.

Corporate DeFi?

R3’s open-source variation of its enterprise blockchain, Corda Network, will see the addition of a native cryptocurrency. The new coin, called XDC, will open the gates to build central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and decentralized finance applications (DeFi) on the network. Programmed by the Cordite Society, a group of former bankers building decentralized tools, the XDC system will have compliance baked in to meet anti-money laundering (AML) standards, as every node represents a legal entity, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. The Cordite Network is welcoming new members to vote on the rate of supply of XDC and other points of governance going forward.

Ironic outcome

Uniswap’s first voting process demonstrated the need to overhaul its governance system, Dharma CEO Nadav Hollander has said, following a “disappointing outcome.” The vote was over reducing the token threshold required to make and pass proposals on the protocol. Despite 98% of the votes cast being in favor of a proposed change, the total number needed for a successful vote fell short of the 40 million required by about 400,000. A successful vote would have seen this requirement drop by around a third. Hollander also said the vote “galvanized users to delegate in much higher numbers,” which was a “healthy outcome for Uniswap.”

Dirty money

Robinhood-esque hackers who stole from corporations to give to charities have seen their donations rebuked. Members of the hacking group Darkside attempted to give bitcoin donations to two non-profits, Children International and The Water Project. The group used ransomware to steal from profitable companies with the intention of giving “some of the money” to charity, according to a BBC report citing a darknet blog. To make the donations, the cybercriminals used the service offered by The Giving Block, a U.S.-based project that converts donations into dollars for charities not set up to handle cryptocurrencies. “If the donation is linked to a hacker, we have no intention of keeping it,” Children International said.

CBDC platform

LINE Corporation, operator of the popular messaging app, is jumping into the CBDC game with a platform to allow central banks to develop digital currencies. The platform reportedly will help central banks develop customized, blockchain-based CBDCs by offering tools to issue digital tokens, tokenize assets and run decentralized applications (known as dapps). LINE is not alone. Mastercard recently released a platform allowing central banks to test how proposed digital currencies would work in real life. A LINE representative told South Korean newspaper Chosun that “major” Asian nations are already in discussions with the firm, though they could not disclose which ones.

Over the past year, deposits have grown by $15.28 billion, or nearly a 40% increase, according to the bank’s earnings release. Signature reports $54.34 billion in total deposits. “Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. As such, analysts have paid close attention to deposit growth at Signature, Silvergate Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank,” CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports.

Bitcoin & the BSA

The executive behind the Helix and Coin Ninja bitcoin mixing services will pay a $60 million fine, following a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) investigation that raises questions around the legality and future of these privacy-protecting tools.

Bitcoin mixers are services designed to anonymize the source of funds. The U.S. financial watchdog hailed these civil charges as the “first” action against a bitcoin mixer.

It was also said to be the first time the U.S. Department of Justice explicitly called bitcoin mixing a “crime,” casting a shadow on any service that obscures bitcoin’s publicly accessible path, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported.

Prosecutors allege Harmon ran the unregistered money services business Helix from 2014 to 2017, conducting 1,225,000 transactions for customers and is “associated with virtual currency wallet addresses that have sent or received over $311 million.” From 2017 on, prosecutors say Harmon provided money transmission services via Coin Ninja.

Each of these transactions are said to be in violation of the Banking Secrecy Act. Prosecutors also said Harmon had a responsibility to file suspicious activity reports and systemically flouted U.S. money laundering laws.

“If you’re in the crypto space you’re about to become as familiar with the BSA as you think you are with the 33 and 34 acts and the Howey test,” Stephen Palley, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Anderson Kill, tweeted. “Each one of these violations is a separate violation of the BSA. That is why the penalty is so massive.”

“The max penalty is $209,144,554. That’s a gobsmackingly enormous number because BSA non-compliance is heavily penalized and because FinCEN really really wants you to comply and really really wants you to be in pain if you don’t comply,” Drew Hinkes, an attorney with Carlton Fields, tweeted.

Harmon also faces criminal proceedings in U.S. federal court.

One sign they might be was provided on Monday by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. During a panel on cryptocurrencies and international payments sponsored by the International Monetary Fund, Powell said that the Fed is researching the viability of creating and maintaining its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).

His words were measured, yet they indicate that the consideration is serious. ""We think it's important that any potential CBDC would serve as a complement to, and not a replacement for, cash and current private-sector digital forms of the dollar such as commercial bank money,"" he said.

Powell enumerated several concerns that he and his colleagues must take into account, not least the potential CBDC's effect on monetary policy and supply, and how it would impact financial stability. Security and privacy are also important considerations.

Some cryptocurrency bulls have advocated for a overarching and accessible global cryptocurrency. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had ambitions in this sphere, announcing in 2019 that it was creating such a product, Libra. But lawmakers and critics soon pounced on the idea of Facebook potentially acting as a sort of unregulated, digital-age central bank on its own, and potential partners started to abandon the project.

Powell's pronouncements, while optimistic, appeared to be short on detail. So at this early stage it's hard to gauge how the Fed's moves in this arena will impact Facebook's project, in addition to cryptocurrency businesses such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC).

Judging by investor reaction to Powell's words, a company like Grayscale might benefit from the creation of a Fed cryptocurrency. In contrast to the broader market's Monday slump, Grayscale's stock rose by 3.2%.",2020-10-20 00:00:00,,,,,,

Bitcoin soared as much as 8% on Wednesday after PayPal announced it would open its service to cryptocurrency purchases and sales.

Bitcoin reached an intraday high of $12,817.17, well above its previous 2020 record of $12,473. It was bitcoin's highest level since July 2019.

The world's largest cryptocurrency is up more than 11% this week alone. Bitcoin broke through the key $12,000 level on Tuesday, and the PayPal news added more fuel to the upswing.

PayPal said it would allow its users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies from their accounts starting in a few weeks. It added that more than 26 million merchants using the platform would also be able to accept cryptocurrencies as a funding source.

PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said in a statement.

PayPal hopes the service will encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by central banks and corporations, President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in an interview.

“We are working with central banks and thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role,” he said.

U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said. It plans to expand to Venmo and some countries in the first half of 2021.

Other mainstream fintech companies, such as mobile payments provider Square Inc and stock trading app firm Robinhood Markets Inc, allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but PayPal’s launch is noteworthy given its vast reach.

The company, based in San Jose, California, has 346 million active accounts around the world and processed $222 billion in payments in the second quarter.

Cryptocurrencies tend to be volatile, making them attractive to speculators, but a lot less appealing to merchants and shoppers. Transactions have been slower and more costly than other mainstream payment systems.

Cryptocurrency payments on PayPal will be settled using fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, meaning merchants will not receive payments in virtual coins, the company said.

Many central banks around the world have expressed their intention to develop digital versions of their currencies in the coming years, while Facebook Inc-led the creation of a cryptocurrency project called Libra in 2019. PayPal was a founding member but dropped out after a few months.

PayPal, which has secured the first conditional cryptocurrency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, will initially allow purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies called ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, it said.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin turned a critical resistance barrier into support that may allow it to rise towards $13,350.

Meanwhile, Ethereum whales have been loading up attempting to push prices to $470.

On the other hand, XRP presents an ambiguous outlook, but the technicals are leaning bullish.

While Bitcoin looks poised for further gains after slicing through $12,500, Ethereum and XRP are approaching crucial resistance suggesting an imminent breakout.

Bitcoin Aims for New Yearly Highs

Bitcoin appears to have broken out of an ascending parallel channel containing its price action since the market crash in early September. After slicing through the upper boundary of this technical formation, market participants seem to have rushed to exchanges to get a piece of it. The spike in buying pressure was significant enough to push the flagship cryptocurrency to a high of $12,000.

Now that the overhead resistance has been cleared, prices could be about to shoot up by more than 3.5% towards the next area of interest, $13,350. This target is determined by drawing a parallel line equal to the channel’s width.

Such an optimistic thesis holds when looking at IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model.

Based on this on-chain metric, Bitcoin currently sits on top of a massive supply barrier that may have the strength to keep falling prices at bay in the event of a sell-off. Roughly 1.6 million addresses had previously purchased over 1 million BTC between $11,550 and $11,930.

On the flip side, the IOMAP cohorts show little to no resistance ahead of the pioneer cryptocurrency that will prevent it from achieving its upside potential.

The only crucial hurdle to pay attention to lies at $13,310, right next to the target presented by the parallel channel previously mentioned. Here, less than 120,000 addresses are holding approximately 75,000 BTC.

Nathan Batchelor, the lead Bitcoin analyst for SIMETRI, said:

“Today’s breakout in BTC does not come as a surprise, given the bullish fundamentals over recent weeks. A major bout of USD weakness only served to accelerate the technicals which have been pointing to a run towards $12,500. Looking at the where BTC heads to next; continued gains above the $12,500 level could encourage bulls to test towards the $13,500 or $13,900 area in the near-term.”

Ethereum Awaits for Volatility

Ethereum has endured a consolidation period over the past month. Its price action led to the formation of an ascending triangle within the 4-hour chart. A horizontal resistance formed along with the swing highs, while a rising trendline was created along with the swing lows.

Although Bitcoin seems to have decoupled from the rest of the market, the smart contracts giant may soon follow its steps. Santiment’s holder distribution chart reveals that the buying pressure behind Ethereum is rapidly increasing.

The number of addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH rose by nearly 1.7% over the past two weeks. Roughly 16 new whales have joined the network over this short period. The upswing is quite significant when considering these investors hold between $3.8 million and $38 million worth of Ether.

If demand for Ethereum continues accelerating, prices will likely break through the x-axis of the triangle previously mentioned and aim for $470.

IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP shows that the $380-$390 range is the only hurdle that could prevent Ether from breaking out. Approximately 1.4 million addresses are holding nearly 1.8 million ETH around this level.

While holders within this price pocket may try to break even on their underwatered positions, slicing through it will drastically increase the odds of a significant upswing.

It is worth mentioning that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap sits on top of a large supply wall. More than 1.3 million addresses bought 14 million ETH between $367 and $377.

Therefore, only a break below this critical support barrier may jeopardize the bullish outlook.

XRP Prepares to Break Out

Like Ethereum, XRP’s price action is also contained within an ascending triangle over the past month. While whales have been loading up on this token since Oct. 13, the demand increase has yet to be reflected on prices. Until then, the $0.24 support and the $0.26 resistance will play a key role in determining where this cryptocurrency is headed next.

Moving past resistance may trigger FOMO among market participants. The increase in buy orders will likely see the cross-border remittances token surge towards $0.30.

This target is determined by measuring the distance between the widest point of the triangle and adding it to the breakout point.

Meanwhile, an increase in selling pressure around the current price levels could push prices below the triangle’s hypotenuse. Slicing through this area can be considered a breakdown of this pattern. Under such circumstances, investors would have to prepare for XRP to drop towards $0.21.

Despite the ambiguity that XRP presents, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) index favors the bulls. Each time the MVRV drops below -8%, a buying opportunity presents. Conversely, when this indicator rises above 18%, it signals that a correction is underway.

Since late September, the MVRV moved out of the “buy zone” and is currently hovering around 2.6%. Such levels indicate that XRP has a lot of room to go up before it enters the “sell zone.” Thus, it is imperative to pay close attention to the $0.26 resistance barrier since breaking through it will confirm the optimistic outlook.

The Crypto Market Moves Forward

The HODL strategy has never looked better than today despite the opportunities to profit previously presented. More than 15 publicly traded companies are holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and now PayPal has decided to join the party.

The online payments firm announced that it would enable U.S. customers to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies. The initial list of digital assets available includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. The firm will also subsidize all trading or storage fees.

The move is set to enable over 26 million merchants connected to PayPal to trade goods for cryptos globally. This is a significant step towards mass adoption that will likely help the crypto market enter a new bullish cycle.

The total number of Bitcoins on exchanges has been steadily declining since March 12th and 13th, when the most famous crypto market crash of the year took place.

Indeed, during those two days, the price of Bitcoin swiftly fell from over $9,000 to nearly $4,000. Since then, data from Glassnode shows that the amount of Bitcoin that is stored in cryptocurrency exchange accounts has fallen $2.85 billion, from 2,950,000 BTC to 2,700,000 BTC.

Why is this happening? And what does it mean for Bitcoin?

BitMEX and OKEx Incidents May Be Fostering Mistrust in Crypto Exchanges

The decline in the amount of Bitcoins being stored on cryptocurrency exchanges could indicate declining user trust in the ability to keep their funds safe.

Indeed, the word of the wise in the cryptocurrency space has long been to never store cryptocurrency on an exchange for any longer than you absolutely have to, but that has not always been the most common practice.

Indeed, there have been a number of incidents throughout the year in which user funds on crypto exchanges and other crypto platforms have been affected: in late September, KuCoin was hacked for roughly $281 million; Eterbase, Cashaa, Balancer, and others have also been hacked.

However, two recent incidents regarding two large cryptocurrency exchanges may have served as an extra incentive for traders to get their coins out of exchange accounts as quickly as possible, though, in both cases, hackers were not involved.

Instead, the trouble came from the law enforcement side of things: specifically, last week’s arrest of OKEx founder Star Xu, as well as the indictment of the four co-founders of BitMEX that took place earlier this month.

While BitMEX’ operations have been more or less unaffected since the indictment, the OKEx incident is another story. Xu’s arrest seems to have caused the exchange to suspend all of its operations; at press time, users could not withdraw their funds from the exchange.

An October 20th tweet from OKEx chief executive, Jay Hao said that “no on-chain out-flow” since the exchange announced it had “temporarily suspended” withdrawals on Friday. P2P fiat activity for the Chinese yuan on the exchange has since been resumed.

While Hao promised that “your assets are safe” and that “we’ll do our best to resume withdrawals ASAP,” the incident has raised concern and frustration from affected users. (Finance Magnates reached out to OKEx for commentary; comments will be added as they are received.)

”Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto.”

After all, even if the loss of access to funds is only temporary, it is still a serious matter: “whenever exchanges block or suspend withdrawals, users enter into a panic,” explained Juan Aja Aguinaco, co-Founder of Shyft Network, to Finance Magnates.

“This further erodes confidence in third-party custody and reinforces the long recited mantra: ‘not your keys, not your crypto’…No one wants to see their funds frozen and stuck in an exchange just because it’s going through a legal battle with the US Department of Justice, or because there was a major security breach.”

Beyond frustration and panic, users’ funds could be at serious risk: John Jefferies, Chief Financial Analyst at cybersecurity firm CipherTrace, told Finance Magnates that for example, “OKEx assumes no liability if the platform is unable to operate properly for numerous reasons, including banking issues, regulation, third parties or damages to users.”

Of course, even if OKEx may not be legally liable, the exchange most likely wishes to protect its operations and users’ funds as much as possible. This has been the case with many crypto exchanges that, while that have not necessarily been legally liable, have taken steps to return hacked user funds and right other wrongs when mishaps have occurred.

Still, the amount of control that cryptocurrency exchanges have over their users’ funds should be raising alarm bells. John Jeffries also pointed out that according to the CFTC injunction on BitMEX, “if a customer’s margin balance drops below the Maintenance Margin level, BitMEX takes over the customer’s trading position, the position is liquidated, and the customer’s maintenance margin is lost.”

Jurisdiction-Shopping and a lack of Transparency May Be Fostering Distrust

Interestingly, the news of the BitMEX indictment had a negligible effect on the number of users who continue to regularly use the exchange. Still, the issue of legal liability is particularly important when it comes to transparency about regulations.

“Poor transparency and jurisdiction shopping conspire to increase risk to traders beyond the volatility of the underlying virtual asset,” John Jeffries told Finance Magnates.

For example, “OKEx appears to be in Malta, a well regulated jurisdiction, but according to their Term of Service non-Maltese and non-Italian clients are serviced through a Seychelles subsidiary, Aux Cayes,” Jeffries said.

“Outside of Malta and Italy, Aux Cayes offers riskier financial products, including margin lending, peer-to-peer matching, spot services, and derivative products linked to VFAs or indices.”

Jurisdiction-shopping has long been a matter of great interest in the cryptosphere. In an attempt to gather information on BitMEX’s operations in preparation for a lawsuit, a small firm known as Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement was allegedly forwarded a meme with “incorporated in the Seychelles, come at me bro” written across an image of one of BitMEX’s founders.

Hard Lessons

While both the BitMEX and the OKEx incidents may be a positive thing for the crypto space in the long term, Juan Aja Aguinaco pointed out that “as long as the vulnerability exists, as long as users’ funds can be hacked, frozen or seized ‘en-masse’, concerns [over the safety of exchanges] will remain valid.

“Exchanges have gradually (and painfully) learned how to improve their security systems, how to de-risk by implementing multi-sig wallets, by balancing cold/hot storage, etc. Yet, these improvements appear to be reactionary, and not proactive, which is always a cause for concern.”

But why would cryptocurrency traders who have been consistently storing their assets on exchanges for years, in spite of the risks suddenly be unwilling to do so now?

Other Factors Influencing the Flow of BTC on Exchanges? “There Are, Essentially, Fewer Sellers, and More Holders.”

Indeed, the majority of the decline in the amount of assets stored on exchanges took place prior to both of the recent OKEx and BitMEX goings-on.

Therefore, while distrust in exchanges could be a factor in the decline in the amount of BTC being stored on exchanges, a number of analysts see a different cause behind the trend, one that is a positive thing in terms of short- and long-term bullish sentiment for BTC.

After all, the fact that less BTC is being stored on exchanges could indicate that more traders are holding onto their coins for the long term, waiting for a bigger price movement before they might be willing to sell their coins.

Juan Aja Aguinaco, co-Founder of Shyft Network, told Finance Magnates that “since the dramatic drop in March and the gradual increase in BTC price, more and more users have opted to hold BTC and other cryptos in their own wallets and wait for a major break.

“There are, essentially, fewer sellers, and more holders,” he said.

This hypothesis is also supported by recorded data. According to Glassnode, a large part of the Bitcoin supply is currently being stored in so-called ‘accumulation addresses’, which “are defined as addresses that have at least 2 incoming transactions and have never spent BTC.

“Bitcoin accumulation has been on a constant upwards trend for months,” the firm said, cited by CoinTelegraph. “2.6M $BTC (14% of supply) are currently held in accumulation addresses.”

There are over 500,000 #Bitcoin ""accumulation addresses"" holding a total of 2.6M $BTC (~14%) Accumulation addresses: – have 2+ incoming txs

– never spent BTC

– were active in the past 7 years (accounting for lost coins)

– exchanges & miners are excludedhttps://t.co/Q57xouw6eH pic.twitter.com/lWZngWfj8p — glassnode (@glassnode) August 25, 2020

The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which tracks whether buyers are more likely to sell (fear) or buy and hold (greed), has also tipped decisively toward greed. Last month, the scale was neutral, sitting around 50 points (halfway between fear and greed.) At press time, the scale had reached 56, adding 6 points toward greed.

Corporate Buyers Show Long-Term Bullish Sentiment for BTC

Additionally, Juan Aja Aguinaco pointed out to Finance Magnates that BTC has recently added a number of institutional entities to its list of long-term holders.

Indeed, last week, investment firm Stone Ridge announced a $115 million investment into Bitcoin; earlier this month, Square announced a $50 million BTC investment. Business intelligence firm Microstrategy announced a $425 million Bitcoin investment at the end of September.

Fernando Martinho, chief executive at Nimbus Platform, explained to Finance Magnates that these large-scale crypto purchases may have sprung from concerns over what COVID-related quantitative easing could do to the global economy: “corporate buyers have begun to silently purchase Bitcoin directly in their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation,” he said.

This increase in large-scale BTC purchases may have also caused a decline in the amount of BTC available for purchases on crypto exchanges: “while there is increasing pressure on the exchanges from the retail market, enterprise investors accelerate the trend exponentially, leading to an eventual supply shock,” Martinho explained.

This lack of sellers in the space could further explain why, according to data from crypto analytics firm Skew, BTC has hit its least-volatile point in months: BTC users are holding their coins, creating one of the most stable price periods in Bitcoin’s recent history.

This apparent holding period may come to an end when traders see a sharp upward movement and wish to liquidate some of their coins, but until then, exchanges may see their BTC reserves continue to stay low.",2020-10-21 08:30:21+00:00,https://www.businessinsider.com/next-big-tech-giant-blockchain-based-crypto-expert-2020-10,"Ben Weiss, COO of cash-to-crypto firm CoinFlip.

A cryptocurrency chief predicted that the next biggest company in the world will be one built on blockchain - and it will be based in Asia, not the US.

Crypto regulations are a lot clearer in Asia, whereas uncertainty in the United States does not help consumer confidence and discredits the overall industry, Ben Weiss, chief operating officer at CoinFlip, said.

""I haven't heard any specific plans from Biden, or anyone, on Bitcoin regulation, but there needs to be sensible regulation,"" Weiss said. ""There needs to be regulatory clarity, because the US is losing the blockchain battle right now to a lot of different countries.""

He believes any presidential candidate who is pro-crypto will win the youth vote for the next 15 to 20 years.

The next Apple or Amazon will be a blockchain company based in Asia, not the US, according to Ben Weiss, chief operating officer at CoinFlip, the world's biggest Bitcoin ATM operator.

That's because the US still doesn't have the regulatory clarity required for the crypto industry to grow and innovate, Weiss told Business Insider in an interview on Tuesday.

Compared to Asia, where regulations are a lot clearer, the US does not have well-defined rules that could boost confidence in digital currencies and help legitimize the crypto industry. Weiss specifically touted Singapore as the potential home to the next biggest blockchain company in the world.

After having jumped about 46% this year, Bitcoin was trading at $12,338 on Wednesday. Weiss expects the price to hit $13,500 in the near-term. The US government has basically ignored Bitcoin over the last few years, and they're going to have to address it at some point, he said.

The crypto chief said regulations in the US are required not just to protect consumers, but to spur innovation as several institutional and retail investors realize the risk of not having some amount of bitcoin in their balance sheets.

But despite growing interest in the digital currency space, there is still a lot of uncertainty around the crypto industry, as US regulators and trading authorities have not issued any updated policies or guidelines ahead of the November presidential election.

Weiss believes buying Bitcoin is one of the most political purchases an investor can make, as it's the most democratizing and inclusive financial revolution.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is currently ahead of President Donald Trump in the polls, has no particular stance on Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, although he has supported financial innovation.

""I haven't heard any specific plans from Biden, or anyone, on Bitcoin regulation but there needs to be sensible regulation,"" Weiss said. ""There needs to be regulatory clarity, because the US is losing the blockchain battle right now to a lot of different countries.""

Weiss believes any presidential candidate who is pro-crypto, whether in this election cycle or the next, will win the youth vote for the next 15 to 20 years. ""I'm surprised no major presidential candidate has gotten fully behind Bitcoin yet,"" he added.

Bitcoin rose to its highest point in a year as said it will enable cryptocurrencies on its platform and UK fintech PLC ( ) announced that it was investing heavily in the cryptocurrency.

Mode, the bitcoin banking app that raised £7.5mln as it floated in London earlier this month, said it has allocated up to 10% of its cash reserves to purchase bitcoin and adopt it as a treasury reserve asset.

Bitcoin's US dollar price today topped 12,700 for the first time since July last year amid growing positive news about the currency.

Following US banks receiving the regulatory green light to provide custody storage services for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the summer, recent months have seen a US$50mln investment by US payment group ( ) as it believes that cryptocurrency “provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system”, and a $425mln investment by business intelligence firm Microstrategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR).

PayPal said on Wednesday that it will enable cryptocurrencies on its platform, with users now able to add bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, and litecoin to their wallets, and use it for purchases.

This is part of Mode's long-term goal to protect investors’ assets from currency debasement, it said, with UK interest rates at record lows and potentially turning negative.

Mode claimed to be the first publicly listed company in the UK to make public a significant purchase of bitcoin as part of its treasury investment strategy.

London investors do have access to other cryptocurrency plays, however, with bitcoin miner ( ) last month reporting a 545% increase in bitcoins mined to 1,669 in the first half of the year, while digital assets investors ( ) recently said there are “exciting times ahead” as the crypto markets enter a new bull cycle.

Mode, which is led by entrepreneur Jonathan Rowland whose Jellyworks investment company was famously bought out six months after debuting on the LSE in 2000, said it has long recognised the potential of bitcoin “as a reliable store of value and an attractive investment due to the asset's asymmetric risk/reward attributes and safe haven status”.

Said Rowland: “We truly believe that Bitcoin is a vehicle for financial empowerment and, through Mode, investors can gain exposure to this highly attractive asset class through a listed and fully compliant company. Faced with the challenges of COVID and with UK interest rates at the lowest level in the 's 326-year history, our confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin has only increased.”

The PayPal news could be a game-changer in the mass use of cryptocurrencies, said financial market analyst Neil Wilson at Markets.com, because of PayPal’s sheer scale and reach.

He cautioned that many other barriers to its widespread consumer and business adoption remain.

“Mainstreaming in this way should boost the usage case and this would tend to underpin renewed bullishness around the crypto space, though we are at pains to stress that nothing is certain when it comes to cryptocurrencies.”",2020-10-21 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-hits-two-month-high-above-12300,"Disclosure

The move may stimulate the global use of virtual coins and new digital currencies that may be developed by central banks and corporations

Beginning next year, 346 million potential users and vendors of PayPal will be able to use bitcoin and other virtual coins as a form of payment while shopping online.

READ NEXT Will crypto crack the mainstream in 2020?

The online payments firm, which facilitates payments between parties through online funds transfers, currently has 26 million online merchants on its books. With such a vast reach, bringing crypto into practical usage on the platform could stimulate new global interest in the use of virtual currency. The price of bitcoin rose alongside the news, breaking US$12,000.

President and chief executive Dan Schulman said the move would prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by central banks and corporations. The company is also working with central banks and “thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role.”

PayPal also said it was aiming to increase customer understanding around cryptocurrency in efforts to encourage adoption: “As part of this offering, PayPal will provide account holders with educational content to help them understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” the firm said.

But the payment tech giant isn’t the only major company betting on cryptocurrencies. Square spent US$50 million to buy more than 4,700 bitcoins earlier this month, as the company believes bitcoin could be more a “more ubiquitous currency in the future.”

Various central banks around the world have expressed their intention to develop digital versions of their currencies in the coming years, while Facebook led the creation of a cryptocurrency project called Libra in 2019. PayPal was a founding member but dropped out after a few months.

PayPal will initially allow purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including ethereum, bitcoin cash, and litecoin, now that it has secured the first conditional cryptocurrency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services. It partners with Paxos Trust Company to offer the service.

YOU MIGHT LIKE CRYPTOCURRENCY How ‘legitimizing’ cryptocurrency could benefit businesses

Are we ready for digital currency?

Cryptocurrency is digital money exchanged without fees between two parties online with no involvement from traditional banks and no regulatory oversight by national governments.

Its volatile prices — along with its historical use as a less traceable payment method for illegal purposes — have led to numerous calls for digital money to be regulated.

For some, the idea of circumventing regulated banking intermediaries and operating in the marketplace without using currency backed by the full faith and credit of central banks may seem somewhat obscure and certainly very risky.

However, several well-known companies globally have accepted, contemplated accepting, or tested the use of Bitcoins. For example, WordPress.com, one of the leading blogging platforms, now accepts Bitcoins for payment, as well as offering a Bitcoin application plugin for its notable blog users such as Forbes, CNN, the New York Times, eBay, Sony, and Best Buy.

Several gift card vendors including Gyft and eGifter accept Bitcoins, allowing cardholders to redeem gift cards at Walmart, Target, or other such retailers.

Even several nations have already seen an increase in crypto adoption, with a handful of banks in various stages of research and development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for five of the major currencies of the world: namely the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan, with China leading the charge in terms of progress.

Interestingly, emerging markets, such as India, Nigeria, and Peru are the forerunners in an exciting crypto-boom, having seen the highest increases in usage during recent months.

The elephant in the room remains the accompanying regulatory demands, which will most likely prove to be the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption. Central banks will similarly be critical to defining the framework and standards for all participants.",2020-10-22 11:17:02+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-cryptocurrencies-analysis-idUSKBN2772I4,"LONDON (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc's PYPL.O decision to open its network to bitcoin and its rivals was hailed by virtual coin enthusiasts as a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies and their path towards becoming a widespread means of payment.

FILE PHOTO: The PayPal logo is seen during an event at Terra Gallery in San Francisco, California May 21, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

But the move might do little to drag existing cryptocurrencies out of their niche in payments, according to many fintech specialists, as holders of such coins often view them as an investment asset akin to gold rather than as a means of spending.

PayPal’s decision could, however, help the company attract new users in an increasingly competitive digital payments landscape where innovation is king, the experts said.

It is also likely to prepare the company for the advent of mainstream digital coins, like those that could be developed by central banks, they added. Such coins are a world away from the ethos of bitcoin, which sought to subvert the financial establishment by doing away with a central issuer or authority.

“I think this is more about PayPal being smart and looking to the future when fiat currencies will go digital,” said David Birch, a director at payments consultancy Consult Hyperion. “I don’t think it makes much difference for bitcoin.”

PayPal said on Wednesday it would allow U.S. account holders to hold cryptocurrencies and shop with them at its 26 million merchants. The California-based company plans to expand the service to Venmo, its peer-to-peer payment app popular with younger consumers, by the first half of next year.

The company said it hoped the service would help cryptocurrencies become more useful, while readying its network for the emergence of more mainstream digital coins.

The shift makes PayPal one of the largest companies globally to give consumers access to cryptocurrencies and sent bitcoin’s price soaring to its highest level in over a year.

“For regular people that have never heard of bitcoin, the association between PayPal and bitcoin, those are all signals for bitcoin being recognised as a digital asset that works,” said Lex Sokolin, global fintech co-head at blockchain software company ConsenSys.

But that association might benefit PayPal more than cryptocurrencies, other experts suggested. Indeed, the company’s stock rose more than 5% following after its plans were revealed.

‘MORE OF AN UNKNOWN’

Simon Taylor, a co-founder and head of ventures at fintech consultancy 11:FS, said PayPal’s move would help it attract and retain the interest of customers, or “user engagement”.

“Robinhood and Square used bitcoin for the engagement. Then the question is, would someone want to use it for merchant transactions, which is more of an unknown.”

Square Inc SQ.N, the payments company led by Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, has been offering crypto buying and selling in its increasingly popular P2P payment app Cash since 2018. Bitcoin revenue for Cash App jumped 600% to $875 million in the second quarter, versus a year earlier.

Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc has been offering crypto trading since 2018 and has seen overall business boom this year.

Through the move PayPal is also broadening the suite of products within its wallet, reflecting a winning strategy by Chinese rival Ant Financial, whose popular Alipay digital wallet includes services such as payments, loans and insurance.

‘DARKNET-RELATED MARKET’

PayPal’s vast merchant network is doubtless likely to make it more convenient for consumers to spend their crypto. By making settlement happen through traditional, or fiat, currencies, it also allows merchants to avoid exposure to volatility risk when accepting cryptocurrency payments.

The real question, however, is whether people will actually want to spend their cryptocurrencies, which are seen by many as a store of value, experts said.

Large companies from computer maker Dell Inc [DI.UL] to travel site Expedia Group Inc EXPE.O have announced plans to accept digital assets over the past 10 years, but none have prompted large-scale adoption by cryptocurrency users as a means of payments.

“Nobody really wants to spend crypto,” said Michel Rauchs, author of several Cambridge University studies on cryptocurrencies and blockchain. “Everybody wants to keep it in order to benefit from potential price increase.”

This was echoed by industry analysts.

“If we look at history, basically bitcoin-specific payments haven’t taken off unless it’s a darknet-related market,” said Tim Swanson, the head of market intelligence at blockchain software firm Clearmatics.

MAINSTREAM DIGITAL COINS

Long term, however, the move is likely to help position PayPal at the forefront of facilitating payments in more mainstream digital currencies, like those that could be developed by central banks and large corporations.

PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman said ahead of the launch that the company was working with regulators on central bank digital currencies.

Major central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, have been accelerating research on issuing their own digital currencies, with the People’s Bank of China’s digital yuan project the most advanced.

Plans have been spurred on by the prospect of privately-issued tokens such as Facebook's FB.O Libra gaining wide traction.

PayPal has launched a new service enabling its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency direct from their PayPal account.

The company cited the Covid-19 pandemic as driving migration towards digital payments, as well as the increased interest in digital currencies from central banks and consumers, as behind the move.

Cryptocurrencies on the initial list include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, with plans to expand to Venmo and ‘select international markets’ in the first half of 2021. The company has also been granted a conditional Bitlicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

There is an important distinction to make here, as the company notes:

“PayPal customers will be able to use their cryptocurrency holdings as a funding source to pay at PayPal’s 26 million merchants around the globe. Consumers will be able to instantly convert their selected cryptocurrency balance to fiat currency, with certainty of value and no incremental fees.

“In effect, cryptocurrency simply becomes another funding source inside the PayPal digital wallet, adding enhanced utility to cryptocurrency holders, while addressing previous concerns surrounding volatility, cost and speed of cryptocurrency-based transactions.”

Ultimately, cryptocurrency payments processed by PayPal will be settled in fiat currencies. What’s more, there is little to no interoperability at the moment. Three questions on a PayPal cryptocurrency FAQ page – which is not readily advertised in its press materials – give more information on the options available:

Can I use Cryptocurrencies to pay or send money with PayPal?

At this time, you cannot use Crypto as a way to pay or send money on PayPal. Can I use my Cryptocurrency balance as a funding source for my purchases?

No, not at this time. Can I transfer Cryptocurrency into and out of PayPal?

Currently, you can only hold the Cryptocurrency that you buy on PayPal in your account. Additionally, the Cryptocurrency in your account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off PayPal.

In spite of the caveats however, this certainly makes for an interesting development, particularly given PayPal was one of the payment vendors who dropped out of the Libra project last year. Libra itself, in April, made a strategic change to tie more into local currencies, citing regulatory hurdles. The service as it stands can be seen as similar to Robinhood right now, as industry analysts have noted.

“Our global reach, digital payments expertise, two-sided network, and rigorous security and compliance controls provide us with the opportunity, and the responsibility, to help facilitate the understanding, redemption and interoperability of these new instruments of exchange,” said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal in a statement.

“We are eager to work with central banks and regulators around the world to offer our support, and to meaningfully contribute to shaping the role that digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,” Schulman added.

The online payments company declared adding crypto was a significant milestone on the path to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Bitcoin investors agreed: Prices rose 5% on the news Wednesday.

The efficiency, speed and resilience of cryptocurrencies give people financial inclusion and access advantages, said PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman, who described the eventual shift from physical to digital currencies as ""inevitable.""

Cryptocurrency is digital money exchanged without fees between two parties online with no involvement from traditional banks and no regulatory oversight by national governments.

""Our global reach, digital payments expertise, two-sided network, and rigorous security and compliance controls provide us with the opportunity, and the responsibility, to help facilitate the understanding, redemption and interoperability of these new instruments of exchange,"" Schulman said in a statement. ""

How it works

PayPal says its new service will give customers the ability to hold and exchange Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin cryptocurrencies using the company's digital wallet, which lets people shop online, request and send money.

The company's US customers will receive crypto service access in the coming weeks, but they won't be able to pay for products and services using cryptocurrency until early 2021. PayPal's Venmo customers and select international consumers won't have crypto services until some time in the first half of 2021.

Investors responded positively to the news Wednesday, as PayPal's stock price surged following opening bell before retreating close to where it opened for the day. The company's stock has more than doubled since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States in mid-March.

The pandemic has fueled a boom in the online payments industry and companies like PayPal, Square and Venmo -- which is owned by PayPal -- because many coronavirus-wary consumers are avoiding the use of physical cash.

PayPal isn't the only major company betting on cryptcurrencies. Square spent $50 million to buy more than 4,700 bitcoins earlier this month. Square Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told reporters at the time that the company believes bitcoin could be more a ""more ubiquitous currency in the future.""

Bitcoin's October rally will continue as investors start scooping up the token as an inflation hedge, the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones said Thursday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 20% this month and recently rallied above $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.

With the Federal Reserve set to pursue price growth above 2% in the future, bitcoin will serve as ""the best inflation trade,"" Jones said on CNBC.

Betting on the cryptocurrency is also like making an early investment in a tech behemoth like Apple or Google, he added.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin recently spiked to its highest level since July 2019, and the hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones expects inflation trends to boost the digital token even further.

The world's largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 20% this month after breaking through key psychological levels and gaining approval from financial-industry titans. Wednesday saw bitcoin rally above its 2020 peak to an intraday high of $13,229.37 before paring gains.

The cryptocurrency hovered just below $13,000 on Thursday, and the rally is still only in its ""first inning,"" Jones said on CNBC on Thursday. The Federal Reserve's updated policy framework will allow for brief overshoots of its 2% inflation target to offset the slowed pace of price growth, he said. The new strategy has investors looking for new inflation hedges as the economy recovers, and Tudor Jones views the cryptocurrency as the strongest bet.

""I came to the conclusion that bitcoin was going to be the best inflation trade,"" Jones said.

Bitcoin bulls have long praised the token for its potential as an inflation hedge. Since the coin is separate from traditional currencies, its value is insulated from inflation rates and, more broadly, monetary policy.

Tudor said he also viewed bitcoin as an early bet on a tech breakthrough, similar to holding Apple or Google shares early in the companies' lifetimes. The cryptocurrency has backing from ""really, really smart and sophisticated people,"" he said. The founder of Tudor Investment Corp. added that he had a small single-digit stake in bitcoin.

Tudor's comments were the latest to fuel the coin's surge from March lows. Bitcoin gained in Wednesday trading after PayPal announced it would allow its users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies starting in a few weeks. Square made a $50 million investment in bitcoin earlier this month, and Fidelity rolled out its first bitcoin-focused fund in August.

The token is up more than 78% year-to-date but remains far from retaking its December 2017 peak of nearly $20,000. Bitcoin traded at $12,866.39 as of 10:25 a.m. ET.

The title was designed for controversy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) seems to be everything Bitcoiners reject: useless tokens created for haphazard projects and quick money-grabs driven by ponzinomics. All of this happening on Ethereum, Bitcoin’s unprincipled competitor.

Yet, to dismiss the piece, and its author Matt Luongo, would be a mistake. Matt is an ardent Bitcoiner making an argument that to me seems obvious. As a long-time Bitcoiner, it has always been my dream to extend Bitcoin’s decentralization to the wider economy. That is precisely what Matt is saying: It is time for us to take our belief in decentralization to the next level.

Edan Yago is a contributor to Sovryn and founder of CementDAO. Sovryn is a decentralized bitcoin trading and lending platform. CementDAO is a decentralized tool to unite the fragmented stablecoin ecosystem.

We already have a decentralized currency; now we should decentralize the services through which we use that currency. I disagree, however, with Matt’s proposed solution.

The same day Matt’s article came out, we learned BitMEX, where so many Bitcoiners have deposited their bitcoin, is under threat. Not only does this place users’ bitcoin and private information in jeopardy, it also threatens the availability of a type of financial service that many Bitcoiners have found useful.

Over time, all BitMEX-type services will find themselves under pressure to become regulated. They will demand users dox themselves through know-your-customer (KYC) rules. They will continue to become centralized chokepoints in the Bitcoin economy where authorities can exert pressure, control and extend their tentacles of surveillance. This is not how we build an uncensorable, permissionless economy around bitcoin. We need an alternative.

If we want to extend Bitcoin’s ethos of freedom and self-sovereignty beyond just hodling, then bitcoin services must become decentralized. That’s what DeFi is. Bottom line, nobody should be paying more attention and be more supportive of DeFi than Bitcoiners.

There is simply no reason to build ""Bitcoin DeFi"" on Ethereum.

So where do Matt and I disagree? Matt suggests the way to accomplish that is by taking advantage of the DeFi services being built on Ethereum. To make this possible, he has been working hard on tBTC, a more decentralized way of tokenizing bitcoin on Ethereum.

Ethereum, he argues, is where the action is, it is where the DeFi services are, it is where the network effects are being built. All of this is true. However, it is also true that on Ethereum, tokenized BTC, however well decentralized the token is, will always be a second-class citizen. The base currency is ether (ETH), the transaction fees are paid in ETH, the security assurances are those of Ethereum.

For me, and I suspect for many, this is at best a major disadvantage and at worst a fatal flaw. There is simply no reason to build “Bitcoin DeFi” on Ethereum. Bitcoin layer 2 provides all the tools to do this in a bitcoin-native environment, with clearer security assurances, lower fees and without creating competing altcoins.

Bitcoin buys

Following a wave of institutional bitcoin buys, crypto custodian Hex Trust and multinational payments gateway Sia have partnered to provide an easier path for banks to hold digital assets. Announced Thursday, Hex Trust will offer custodial software to banks, through Sia, to enable them to hold bitcoin, security tokens and central bank digital currencies for their banking clients. Currently, Hex Trust works with three banks – Mason Privatbank Liechtenstein AG and two unnamed Asian banks. Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini said the firm has 10 other banks that are exploring the custodian’s products.

Bitcoin DeFi?

Hodl Hodl, a non-custodial bitcoin exchange, is launching a lending product seeking status as “the first true bitcoin DeFi” product. Users will be able to borrow USDT, USDC, PAX or DAI stablecoins in a peer-to-peer fashion, without going through know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, leaving their bitcoin as collateral. Hodl Hodl’s Lend marketplace will not act as a custodian and won’t store bitcoin collateral, instead opting for a multisig setup where lender, borrower and Lend each get a key. The lender and the borrower will agree on the amount, time period, interest rate of the loan and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which can be anywhere between 30% and 70%. Lend will take a 2% commission from each deal.

Token merger

Voyager Digital, a publicly traded digital asset brokerage, has agreed to buy LGO, an institutional-focused crypto exchange. As part of the merger, which is awaiting regulatory approval, the companies will merge their two utility tokens, VGX and LGO, for newly minted tokens featuring decentralized finance (DeFi) functions such as community governance and staking at an initial interest rate of 7%. “We think this is really taking the old-school mergers and acquisitions to the token world, which hasn’t been done before,” Steve Enrlich, Voyager’s CEO said. Upon completion, Voyager will issue one million shares for the acquisition and operate in the European retail market with LGO’s Virtual Asset Service Provider registration.

The initiative will see the bank’s RBI Coin integrated with the Pantos blockchain interoperability tool from Vienna-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda, according to a press release on Thursday. RBI Coin facilitates near-instant payments between banks and businesses. Raiffeisen hopes the proof-of-concept will eventually lead the banking industry to become “technology-agnostic in the field of fast-changing blockchain technologies.”

The middle ground?

In the wake of charges brought against BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives exchange that operated for nearly its entire existence without know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, the topic of financial privacy and splinter economies has never been more heightened.

In crypto, the privacy debate is often waged between originalists, who view these cryptographic monies as a means to transact, no questions asked, and the mainliners, who are willing to sacrifice some of crypto’s independence to reach the mainstage of the global economy.

CoinDesk’s Ian Allison explored this divide yesterday in an article rounding up reactions to PayPal’s crypto market entrance. In offering crypto trading and transactional services to a pool of 346 million users and 26 million merchants, the fintech giant will require full KYC and inhibit self-custody.

“Yes, if you’re a pure libertarian, it’s not ideal. But being pragmatic about bitcoin’s trajectory and global adoption penetration rate, this certainly brings more options,” said Charles Hayter, CEO and co-founder of data site CryptoCompare.

PayPal is not alone. Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange by trading volume, recently decided to implement mandatory ID verifications by year’s end. Users will now be required to submit government-issued photo identification, as well as a proof of residence.

This follows on BitMEX’s announcement to accelerate its own planned KYC program. Charged by the U.S. government with facilitating unregistered trading, BitMEX said all of its customers would need to verify their identities by Nov. 5, three months earlier than the original deadline.

Opposingly, today Hodl Hodl unveiled a product that will enable KYC-less, P2P lending, bucking the trend of payment and lending firms to require users to register using their real identities.

While not a perfect analogy, perhaps one way this battle will shake out follows from reactions to the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule.” Coinciding with CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed conference, analysts assessed the knock-on effects of these anti-money laundering financial regulations on tools designed to eschew national borders and mandates.

Speaking at a panel discussion, Bakkt President Adam White said most crypto companies will fall in line – though there will always be a contingent that stands apart. If that happens, there could be a viable “gray market” between the regulated and unregulated, verified and unverified, and KYC’d and non-KYC’d.

Bitcoin's massive leap since Wednesday may have gone too far, too fast.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency surged above $13,000 on Wednesday and continued to climb through the week after PayPal announced its users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin.

Yet the token's 14-day Relative Strength Index passed 80 in Thursday trading.

RSI is a popular gauge of price momentum, and readings over 70 typically signal an asset is overbought.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin's rally through the week might have moved too quickly for investors.

The world's largest cryptocurrency on Wednesday leaped above $13,000 for the first time since July 2019 and hovers around that level as new backers rush to the digital token. The surge began when PayPal announced Wednesday morning that its users will soon be able to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies on its platform. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz called PayPal's move ""the biggest news of the year in crypto.""

Yet the coin's 14-day Relative Strength Index suggests the rally got ahead of itself. The popular technical measure is used to gauge an asset's momentum and determine whether it's overbought or oversold.

Bitcoin's RSI jumped above 80 in Thursday trading and remained there in early Friday trading. Values above 70 suggest the asset is overbought and might be due for a reversal.

The cryptocurrency traded above $13,000 early Friday before falling slightly. Though its momentum has slowed since Wednesday's uptick, the coin remains near its 2020 high and is up roughly 20% this month alone.

Much of the new interest in bitcoin stems from its potential use as a hedge against inflation. The Federal Reserve's updated policy framework signals policymakers will pursue temporary bouts of price growth above 2%. The strategy has investors searching for insulated assets, and bitcoin's decoupling from monetary policy has led some financial industry titans to back the volatile asset.

Hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones deemed the coin ""the best inflation trade"" on Thursday, adding that he thinks its rally is only in its ""first inning.""

Bitcoin traded at $12,959.14 as of 8:30 a.m. ET Friday, up 79% year-to-date.

Paypal (PYPL) to begin offering crypto payment service.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose more than 10% to new 52-week highs.

Late last week, crypto-asset exchange OKEx suddenly suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals without much explanation. Later, reports surfaced that the founder of the exchange, Mingxing Xu was under investigation by the Chinese authorities. OKEx is based in Malta but has a headquarters in Hong Kong. The report does not indicate why authorities are investigating Xu. Meanwhile, Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX was charged by the U.S. government with facilitating unregistered trading. BitMEX will now need to implement more robust identification requirements. Despite the flurry of poor news, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls remained undeterred. BTC dropped quickly by 3%, but prices quickly stabilized, showing that bulls remained in control.

This week, the cryptocurrency industry saw better news. Payment giant Paypal (PYPL) announced that its customers can now buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts. Investors cheered the news, sending Ethereum (ETH) and BTC higher by more than 10%. The news comes after fellow payment company Square (SQ) announced that it would invest 1% of the firm’s assets into BTC earlier this month.

Bitcoin (BTC) shoots to new 52-week highs after Paypal (PYPL) news.

Next Week’s Market Forecast

Crypto markets have had a bullish tone since Square (SQ) announced the large purchase of Bitcoin (BTC). As a new wave of institutional investors have entered cryptocurrency markets in recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has become less correlated to equity and precious metals markets. Perhaps investors are gravitating out of traditional assets due to the uncertainty of the upcoming U.S. elections.

Now that Bitcoin (BTC) is at new 52-week highs, the next important resistance level to watch is the high from 2019 of approximately 14,000.",2020-10-23 00:00:00,https://www.paymentsjournal.com/paypal-adds-ability-to-buy-sell-and-use-crypto-cost-of-bitcoin-spikes/,"With 346 million active user accounts globally, PayPal’s announcement that it will enable its users to buy and sell crypto is huge. But PayPal’s intent to enable crypto to be accepted at PayPal’s 26 million merchants is arguably even bigger news.

The ability for PayPal users to buy, hold, and sell crypto increases the opportunity for individuals to invest, but when PayPal users have the ability to pay for goods and services at PayPal’s 26 million merchants, crypto might actually become more like traditional currencies. Wide acceptance is critical and has been one of the hurdles holding back the broader use of crypto. It will be interesting to see how other networks and acquirers react to this crypto news.

Here’s more coverage from a Futures Magazine article:

“Yesterday, PayPal announced their intention to launch a feature for buying, selling, and being a custodian for several cryptos for U.S. customers while also allowing customers to use crypto to make purchases with merchants integrated with PayPal in 2021 when a global rollout is expected. This is one of the most impactful corporate announcements in the space in some time. The new feature, which will offer services in BTC, ETH, BCH and LTC, will become available ‘in the coming weeks’ according to PayPal. In an interview with Reuters, the firm’s CEO Dan Schulman said the new service is meant to encourage the global uptake of crypto and to prepare its network of users and merchants for new ‘digital currencies’ that may be developed by central banks or corporations. Schulman said PayPal is ‘working with central banks and thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role.’

LONDON — Ripple, the $10 billion financial technology company best known for cryptocurrency XRP, is considering relocating its headquarters overseas due to frustration with the U.S. regulatory environment. The San Francisco-based firm's CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who says he visited London only last month, told CNBC that U.K. markets watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority doesn't deem XRP a security — a key source of contention in its home market. Other regions had provided similar assurances, he added. ""What you see in the U.K. is a clear taxonomy, and the U.K.'s FCA took a leadership role in characterizing how we should think about these different assets and their use cases,"" Garlinghouse said. ""The outcome of that was clarity that XRP is not a security and is used as a currency. With that clarity, it would be advantageous for Ripple to operate in the U.K."" In addition to the U.K., Garlinghouse said Switzerland, Singapore, Japan and the United Arab Emirates were also under consideration for Ripple's potential move abroad. ""The U.S. is out of sync with other G20 markets and how some of them think about these regulations,"" he added.

Chris Larsen, a co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, first flagged the company's desire to move its global HQ outside the U.S. in an interview with Fortune magazine earlier this month. Ripple has been locked in a legal battle with some cryptocurrency investors who accuse it of selling unregistered securities and making misleading statements about XRP. The company disputes the allegations, pushing back on the suggestion XRP qualifies as a security. Meanwhile, officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are not securities that should be regulated in the same way as stocks and bonds. The status of XRP has been shrouded in uncertainty. The ""security"" label matters because it could bring XRP under strict new rules — and that could heavily impact Ripple. Though it claims to be independent of the cryptocurrency, Ripple owns 55 billion of the total 100 billion XRP tokens in existence. The company even makes revenue from selling some of its XRP holdings each quarter.

What is XRP?

XRP is the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ripple says it mainly uses the digital asset as a ""bridge currency"" for its financial services clients to send money overseas quickly and cheaply. The company works with some of the world's largest financial institutions, including Santander and American Express. However, those firms do not currently use XRP for settling transactions.",2020-10-23 00:00:00,https://investorplace.com/2020/10/7-cryptocurrency-stocks-to-stand-test-of-time/,7 Cryptocurrencies to Stand the Test of Time,2020-10-07 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-adds-300-million-in-cryptocurrency-assets-under-management-in-just-24-hours/,"Grayscale Adds $300 Million in Cryptocurrency Assets Under Management in Just 24 Hours

Grayscale Investments said Thursday that it added $300 million in net assets under management (AUM) in just the last 24 hours.

The firm now has a record $7.3 billion in total AUM, according to a tweet by Barry Silbert, chief executive officer of the Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company. The biggest daily increases were reported in the litecoin trust, whose value rose 8% to $34.3 million. The bitcoin trust remains Grayscale’s biggest portfolio, inching 4% to $6 billion. The ETH and BCH trusts rose 4.9% and 4.6% respectively. Others gained between 2% and 6%. Grayscale profited from surging institutional interest in bitcoin. Paypal’s unexpected dive into crypto this week appears to have lit the markets up. The announcement pushed the price of bitcoin above $13,000 on Wednesday, a 2020 high – and so with it Grayscale’s trusts’ valuations. The $300 million Grayscale added represents a significant increase over the $1.05 billion in investments that it amassed over a whole 90-day period during the third quarter of 2020.



As corporate interest in bitcoin continues to increase, institutional-investor focused entities like Grayscale are also expected to continue to experience immense growth.

Key Takeaways:

Paul Tudor Jones has been actively investing, trading, and managing billions of dollars since 1980.

Reuters has described him as a legend of macro traders.

Paul Tudor Jones is a “single-digit” Bitcoin investor and his investment has gained 42% in value since May 2020.

The hedge fund manager says investing in Bitcoin is an inflation hedge with intellectual capital behind it.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Oct. 22, where among other topics, he also discussed Bitcoin.

Last May, Paul Tudor Jones made a single-digit investment into Bitcoin, and he backed up his decision by saying that he likes Bitcoin even more now.

The legendary hedge fund manager compared Bitcoin to being an early investor in a tech company. However, instead of betting on humankind’s ingenuity and entrepreneurialism, with Bitcoin, you bet on humanity’s fallacies to keep on creating inflationary economics.

Talking about Bitcoin, he said:

“…you’ve got this group, that’s by the way, crowdsourced all around the world, that are dedicated to seeing bitcoin succeed and it becoming a commonplace store of value and transactional to boot. I’ve never had an inflation hedge where you have a kicker, that you also have great intellectual capital behind it, so that makes me even more constructive on it.”

He wrapped up his segment on the cryptocurrency by saying, “I think we are in the first inning of Bitcoin.”

Bitcoin has gained 42.126% since May 7th, when Paul Tudor Jones made his “single-digit” Bitcoin investment. In more recent times, Bitcoin’s price has grown by 21% in the past two weeks, and it is continuing to rise alongside uncertainty as we approach Election Day on Nov 4th.",,https://www.coindesk.com/indicators-crypto-traders-chainalysis,"Analyzing cryptocurrency markets may seem easier than traditional markets because blockchain technology has more built-in transparency, enabling anyone to analyze and audit on-chain data.

Simultaneously, however, there are challenges to zeroing in on forward-looking numbers that give insights into current and future price trends. Philip Gradwell, chief economist at the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, joined CoinDesk earlier this week to discuss the five must-track on-chain indicators for all traders.

Exchange inflows

“The first indicator that I look at every day is exchange inflows,” Gradwell said.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings and take direct custody of their holdings when they have a bullish view on the cryptocurrency.

A surge in inflows in a rising market could be considered a sign investors lack confidence in the uptrend. “When you see large inflows, it’s time to be cautious,” Gradwell added.

Also read: Bitcoin Risks Deeper Price Pullback as Exchange Inflows Spike

Nonetheless, inflows do not imply immediate liquidation. Investors can hold their coins on exchanges for as much time as they want.

“Historically coins have been liquidated with a lag of 12 to 36 hours,” Gradwell said, adding that during the March crash there was panic selling.

Thus, this indicator is just one piece of the puzzle because we don’t know when the transferred coins will be sold. What’s more an uptick in inflows or selling pressure is often matched by an equal or more substantial buying pressure.

Trade intensity

To determine the impact of exchange inflows on the supply side, investors should keep an eye on the demand side with the help of the “trade intensity” metric, which measures the number of times an inflowing coin is traded.

“It tells us how many people are willing to buy bitcoins sent to exchanges,” Gradwell said. An uptick in trade intensity shows that buyers are outweighing sellers and it is a sign of trend strength.

Bitcoin jumped over 7% to 15-month highs above $12,300 on Wednesday. Amid the price rally, cryptocurrency exchanges tracked by blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis received a total of 106,519 BTC on Wednesday, the highest daily inflow since Oct. 2.

BTC inflows to exchanges Source: Chainalysis

However, the rise in inflows failed to apply the brakes to the price rally because demand was strong. Bitcoin’s trade intensity jumped to a two-month high of 5.8, more than double the 90-day average.

While exchange inflows and trade intensity help gauge short-term market conditions, the remaining three indicators are more about long-term trends.

Interexchange flows

Investors can buy cryptocurrencies with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or use dollar-backed stablecoins like tether to fund purchases.

Crypto-to-fiat exchanges facilitate the exchange of dollars for cryptocurrencies, while at crypto-to-crypto exchanges stablecoins are used as a gateway to crypto trading.

Investors can determine whether the market is driven by fiat buyers (such as institutions) or tether traders by keeping track of net flows between these two types of exchanges.

Net flow from crypto-to-fiat exchanges to crypto-to-crypto exchanges suggests the market is dominated by stablecoin traders. In this scenario, a rise in the stablecoin’s issuance could be considered a leading indicator of an impending price rally.

Interexchange flows Source: Chainalysis

However, that, too, isn’t set in stone. Since March, crypto-to-fiat exchanges have received 206,000 BTC from crypto-to-crypto exchanges, according to Chainalysis. “It indicates that fiat buyers have mainly driven the market,” Gradwell noted, adding that the data confirms the bullish narrative of rising institutional participation in the top cryptocurrency.

Liquidity

Investors can gauge the hodling sentiment in the market by keeping track of the number of liquid and illiquid entities – clusters of addresses controlled by the same participants in a network. Chainalysis identifies entities by analyzing blockchain transaction patterns to identify which addresses are controlled by a single person or business. This gives a more accurate picture of what is going on as the data better reflects actual holdings and transfers between people and business, reducing the noise of internal movements of cryptocurrency.

Liquidity is the average ratio of net to gross flows of an entity’s assets over the entity’s lifetime, across all addresses controlled by the entity. Chainalysis defines a liquid entity as the one that sends on average at least 25% of the assets it receives, while an illiquid entity is the one that sends on less than 25% of its received assets.

Essentially, an illiquid entity is the one that appears to believe in the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects and hoards coins. That has a weakening effect on selling pressure in the market. For that reason, a sustained rise in the number of illiquid entities is a sign of strong hodling sentiment and a bullish indicator.

Bitcoin liquidity Source: Chainalysis

The above chart shows the liquidity of bitcoin has declined to the lowest level since mid-2017. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise from $5,000 to $20,000 that happened in the final quarter of that year.

Also, the amount of illiquid bitcoin has risen sharply. “It’s been increasing at a greater rate this year than it did before. So you’ve got more investors than ever before. But there’s also fewer bitcoin that are liquid and available to buy than ever before,” Gradwell said.

That possibly the reason why bitcoin recently held steady above $10,000 despite the BitMEX indictments, KuCoin hack, OKEx private key drama, U.S. President Donald Trump’s health scare and a global stock market sell-off.

Value transfers across blockchains

Value transfer refers to the U.S. dollar value of total units on a blockchain that are transferred on a given day. It essentially represents the usage of the blockchain and is accompanied by a rise in the transaction count.

“When there’s greater usage of a cryptocurrency there’s more demand, and that drives the price up,” Gradwell said.

Value transfers across blockchains Source: Chainalysis

Ether’s value transfer began rising sharply in mid-July. A week later, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid around $250 and ended up rallying to $470 by mid-August. Ether led the broader market higher in July and August and outshined bitcoin by rallying 53% and 26%, respectively.

Up until last year, bitcoin pretty much led the broader market in both bull and bear runs. Most investors would buy ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies during bitcoin’s bull run and sell those other cryptocurrencies when bitcoin was on the downturn.

However, the dynamics have changed this year with the explosive growth of the Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocols, making it imperative for investors to track on-chain activity of ether and other coins.",2020-10-23 10:00:00+00:00,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4381145-bitcoin-is-biggest-legal-front-running-opportunity-ever-seen-pal,"Javascript is Disabled

The entry of Paypal into the cryptocurrency industry continues to expose the divide between traditional crypto space players who are less enthusiastic and non-crypto players who endorse the move. Non-crypto players like the analysts at Morgan Stanely are agreement with the notion that the payments giant’s move will lead to greater adoption cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, the analysts believe such a move will not lead an immediate improvement of the company’s bottom line.

In a note, the analysts explain that the move “should expand crypto acceptance online, which to date has stalled at 1% of the top 500 internet retailers.” Still, there is speculation that Paypal’s embrace of crypto is motivated more with the desire to keep up with rival Square than helping bring crypto to the masses.

Violation of Cryptocurrency Principles

Meanwhile, critics of Paypal’s crypto entry like Satoshilabs, a manufacturer of crypto hardware wallets, are less sanguine about the payments giants’ about-turn on bitcoin. Noting that at one point, a former top executive at Paypal once called bitcoin a scam, Satoshilabs says the “service will be entirely custodial, meaning users will not have the key to their own coins.” It is such conditions of service that seem to go against the ideals of bitcoin, which are decentralization and elimination of third parties.

According to Satoshilabs, less reliance on third parties is especially important now when “exchanges are losing user funds, often leaving them (customers) with no recourse.” While Satoshilabs rails against the restrictions that Paypal will impose on the movement of coins, the crypto hardware maker does concede that the payments giant’s regulated entity status will likely attract new users.

Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins

Also echoing the Satoshilabs team’s sentiments is Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO at Ripple whose XRP token is not part of the list of coins Paypal customers can buy. Writing on Twitter, Garlinghouse questions Paypal’s move which he says is:

2 steps forward, 1 step back…Great to see a payment pioneer leaning in, BUT disappointing some fundamental tenets/benefits of crypto are spurned. I suspect PayPal is concerned about the (wait for it…) regulatory uncertainty, impacting its roll-out on a number of levels.

Garlinghouse and others seem to be taking issue with the payments giant’s clarification to customers that “you own the cryptocurrency you buy on PayPal but will not be provided with a private key.” According to Satoshilabs, that statement shows that Paypal’s purported embrace of digital currencies instead “undermines key principles of cryptocurrency.” Still, others like Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya see positives from Paypal’s move.

Paypal’s Determination

Meanwhile, in a move that reaffirms its new commitment to cryptocurrencies, Paypal is reportedly on the verge of acquiring Bitgo, a cryptocurrency custodial services firm. Reports quote unnamed sources saying “PayPal has been in talks with BitGo and may conclude a deal within a few weeks.” However, if negotiations fail, and the payments giant will reportedly seek new targets to purchase.

Alongside the initial announcement, the latest reports appear to be helping to propel the price the Paypal stock upwards. The stock went up 5% on October 21 after the announcement.

As the date of the planned update gets closer, the ETH price keeps rising. Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and adoption, has surged 15% this past week (trading at a little over $400), while the broader crypto markets are experiencing high volatility, OKCoin notes in its recent report.

The extensive report confirmed that some decentralized finance (DeFi) assets are experiencing a price correction after rising dramatically in the past few weeks. The OKCoin team also pointed out that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum surged about 15% during the past week, but most DeFi tokens appear to have stalled.

Major DeFi tokens including Aave (AAVE), Synthetix (SNX), ThorChain (RUNE), Yearn.Finance (YFI), and Compound (COMP) have dropped by around 10% during the last week.

The OKCoin team confirmed:

“Ethereum 2.0 moved closer this week as a developer working on the update revealed that the deposit client code is set to release. DeFi saw continued interest from Silicon Valley this week as Naval Ravikant, a legendary angel investor, discussed it in a podcast. A new decentralized finance project called Barnbridge launched with over $200 million worth of stablecoins in its yield farming pool — a record.”

Crypto-asset fund manager Su Zhu has argued that the underperformance in altcoins may be “pinned to the strength of Bitcoin’s move higher.”

Zhu said that BTC “going up swiftly is not only not bullish for alts but it’s bearish, [because] ,,, money is a coordination game and Bitcoin is the Schelling point; this is independent of how you feel about it, community is literally irrelevant.”

Spencer Noon, Head of DTC Capital, has argued that while major DeFi tokens like AAVE and YFI are down by more than 50% from their all-time highs, the “most important indicators” for the health of this nascent sector are actually heading towards new all-time highs. For instance, the total value locked in DeFi smart contracts has exceeded $12.3 billion (at the time of writing). Meanwhile, the number of ERC-20 compliant stablecoins have reached a valuation of $14 billion.

Noon added:

“Despite a month that saw most tokens fall 50% or more, #DeFi is *still* at ATHs with its most important indicators… Don’t listen to the degens who burned out. Phase 2 of this DeFi bull market will make this summer look like nothing….I believe burnout played a major factor in the recent DeFi drawdown. Farmers spent 3 months (from May to August 2020) making serious gains but with barely any sleep. When the market naturally corrected, anecdotally many of my farmer friends decided to hit the sidelines out of sheer exhaustion.”

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has become the second-largest derivatives market for bitcoin futures in terms of open interest. The popular exchange has seen an influx of demand since the recent Paypal announcement and the Bitmex debacle as well.

Data shows that the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (Bitmex) open interest for bitcoin futures has taken a dive since it was charged with illegally operating in the United States.

CME Group’s rise in open interest began on Oct. 10, as Skew.com reported that the exchange added “nearly 1,500 contracts on the October expiry.”

Since launching in 2017, it’s taken three years for CME Group to catch up with the other bitcoin derivatives markets. CME is now the second-largest bitcoin futures market leader behind Okex in terms of open interest.

Skew.com’s statistics show that CME Group accounts for close to $800 million worth of bitcoin futures contracts this week.

The near $800 million represents over 15.9% of the aggregate open interest amongst 12 derivatives exchanges.

In terms of open interest, exchanges that follow Okex and CME include; Binance, Bitmex, Bybit, Huobi, FTX, Deribit, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bakkt, and Coinflex respectively.

Bitcoin proponents and luminaries believe CME’s open interest stems from banks and institutions beginning to support cryptocurrencies.

Chamath Palihapitiya, the CEO of Social Capital said: “After Paypal’s news, every major bank is having a meeting about how to support bitcoin. It’s no longer optional.”

In terms of aggregate bitcoin futures volumes, CME Group is still behind eight other derivatives exchanges. The top three bitcoin futures trading platforms by volume this week include Binance, Huobi, and Okex.

The increased open interest toward CME Group’s bitcoin futures derivatives contracts coincides with bitcoin’s (BTC) 14.21% price rise during the last seven days.

On Saturday, Skew.com tweeted about CME’s Commitment of Traders (COT) report. “Latest CME bitcoin futures COT report – leveraged funds net record short and institutional net record long,” Skew tweeted. “With market rallying, basis trades are increasingly attractive for hedge funds, currently yielding 10%+”

Key Takeaways Chainlink has launched a new service for Ethereum called Verifiable Random Function (VRF).

VRF can be used by Ethereum developers in games and NFTs that rely on decentralized randomness.

PoolTogether, a lottery prize game on Ethereum is using VRF to choose random winners.

Chainlink is entering Ethereum’s gaming ecosystem. It has launched a service called Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for Ethereum developers to make random outcomes in games more decentralized.

Chainlink Adds Another Dose of Decentralization

Ethereum developers can use VRF to make random outcomes in games more decentralized.

Typically, blockchain games apply centralized solutions to create randomness for gambling or lottery games. Decentralization in blockchain games is needed to ensure that results are unpredictable and have not been manipulated.

Now, VRF has been launched on the Ethereum mainnet and can be utilized in all games that rely on random inputs.

“This launch of Chainlink VRF showcases the power of secure and reliable oracles as not only a means of providing accurate price feeds for the DeFi ecosystem, but generating and delivering provably fair randomness on-chain for gaming, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and various other applications requiring unpredictability,” Chainlink’s team wrote in the announcement.

dApps will send requests for randomness to the oracle network. With each new request for randomness, the Chainlink VRF contract produces a random number on-chain along with a cryptographic proof to check the number’s trustworthiness.

The network charges users in LINK tokens to access the service.

PoolTogether Deployed VRF to Pick Game Winners

Chainlink VRF is being applied to the newest release of the popular DeFi lottery called PoolTogether. The PoolTogether team wrote:

“Chainlink VRF offers a unique set of security guarantees ensuring that no one, including us as the developers, can tamper with the supplied randomness in order to manipulate the outcome of a contract. Additionally, Chainlink VRF allows our users to verify on-chain that pool prize smart contract distributions based on VRF were executed with provably fair and tamper-proof randomness.”

With Chainlink VRF, users can cryptographically check the randomness and be ensured that the results are truly unpredictable. And as the prize pool increases, this added service may attract additional participants.

The industry came into existence with the launch of its first offering, Bitcoin in 2009. Paypal, known as the most used method of transaction in the world, was founded in 1998. Ever since then, the crypto domain has evolved and advanced in multiple surprising ways. However, despite global popularity, cryptocurrencies have not become mainstream and a majority of people still do not know how to turn their crypto investments into a profitable venture. But don’t worry, this article will explore the various ways in which you can put your crypto assets on the working roller and reap in the maximum benefits.

The most promising six ways to double income through crypto:

1. Mining

You cannot be addressed as a crypto lover if you do not know the importance of Bitcoin mining in the world of virtual currencies. It is a technical process that involves solving complex mathematical algorithms using a high-end computer while competing with other crypto miners to receive crypto coins as rewards. The cryptocurrency transactions are verified and added to the blockchain using mining. The user needs to have a lot of technical knowledge about the process and should be in possession of the right hardware equipment like ASIC, GPUs, and many other supporting tools.

2. Investment in ICOs and STOs

Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and Security Token Offerings are also an inevitable part of the crypto world that can pool in some good money for your wallets. New crypto coin projects launch their ICOs to collect money and earn support from the investors and biggies of the crypto world similar to a bitcoin system review. During an ICO, the firm allows investors to purchase tokens, which can be later traded, sold, or held by them. However, the security tokens work as financial securities that are pegged by tangible assets, profits, or the revenue of the launching company. Though both ICOs and STOs can be a good option to catch extra earnings, it is also important to be vigilant while making choices. The market witnesses the entry of new projects promising lucrative returns, every day. Thus, it becomes the duty of the investor to scrutinize the whitepaper of the firm through free forex signal telegram uk, collect information about the development team members, assess the short and long-term goals, and also the roadmap to be perceived by the firm in achieving these goals before investing funds on a project.

3. Buying and HODLing

HODL was a typo which has now, surprisingly, became a humorous backronym suggesting “Hold on for dear life.” In simple words, it refers to the situation where a person has full faith that their crypto coin will certainly have a profitable value in the near future, if not today. Investing in cryptocurrencies with the core purpose of hodling them is one of the most popular means adopted by people to earn money. The most popular crypto coins used for this purpose involve Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple (XRP), Tezos, Monero, etc. To take the maximum advantage of hodling, one needs to have a strong grip on making wild near-about accurate speculations about the coin, market conditions, and risk-bearing capacity as the industry is highly dynamic and things can turn anytime without any warning. So, make sure you have a lot of patience before deciding to hodl assets.

4. Blogging on cryptocurrency websites

Blogging can turn out to be an important way through which you can earn some good profits in cryptocurrencies. These blogging platforms allow users to share their insights on the future price value, fluctuations, and market trends related to leading crypto coins and tokens. The bloggers are paid in cryptocurrencies by these blogging portals if their content is liked by the audience. If the blogger knows that his/her content is valuable, then he/she can directly monetize their content for cryptocurrencies for giving full access to matter to the concerned reader. Some of the leading crypto blogging platforms are Y’alls, Steemit, Yours, etc.

5. Masternodes

Masternode is addressed as an alternative process to crypto mining. It serves as a computer wallet or a full crypto node which lends support to the entire network by storing the full copy of the asset’s ledger in real-time. In lieu of its service, the masternode is rewarded via cryptocurrencies.

6. Staking cryptocurrencies

In simple terms, staking refers to holding your crypto assets in your live crypto wallet for a fixed period as decided by the staking organizer, with an intention to earn interest on them. The reward volume is directly related to the period for which the asset is held during the staking process. It offers a double benefit to the investors as they enjoy price apprehension for holding profitable coins and also earn rewards as dividends for staking.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrencies can be used in multiple ways for generating incomes just like any other traditional financial source. They are secured, transparent, and are simple to operate as they do not involve complicated procedural requirements. All one needs is some high-end knowledge about crypto markets, price fluctuations of coins, market trends, and important crypto investment pedagogies that can be gain from Crypto News. So, don’t wait, pull up your sucks, and delve yourself into the world of cryptocurrencies.",2020-10-24 14:10:18+00:00,,,,,,,,,

Gavin Brown is the Associate Professor in Financial Technology ant the University of Liverpool.

The sale and promotion of derivatives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to amateur investors is being banned in the UK by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It is a further blow to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, coming soon after the US authorities indicted the owners of leading crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX for operating without being US-registered and allegedly failing to follow anti-money-laundering rules.

In view of recent findings from the University of Cambridge that most firms involved in crypto investments are still operating without a license, other operators are potentially vulnerable to indictments too.

It all sounds like bad news for anyone hoping that more investors will put money into cryptocurrencies. But on a closer inspection, I’m not so sure.

Drops and oceans?

The FCA is preventing retail investors from buying and selling the likes of cryptocurrency futures and options, which people often use as a way of hedging their bets on an underlying asset. For example, you might buy an option to sell a certain number of bitcoin at today’s price if the price falls by 10%, giving you an insurance policy in case the market moves against you.

The FCA said it was introducing the ban from January 6 because amateur investors were at risk of “sudden and unexpected losses”. The reasoning is that these people often don’t understand the market, there is lots of “market abuse and financial crime” in the sector, cryptocurrencies are very volatile and they are hard to value.

To stress, the ban is not being extended to professional traders or institutional firms like hedge funds, which have typically been allowed access to riskier financial products than the general population. It is about protecting people who might have been drawn to bitcoin thinking “it may be the currency of the future”, having “heard sensational news coverage about the rise and fall”. There are any number of splashy trading sites offering them quick and easy entry into this world, and YouTube influencers who enthusiastically encourage them to try complex trading.

Some 1.9 million people – around 4% of the adult population – own cryptocurrencies in the UK. Three-quarters have holdings worth less than GBP 1,000 (USD 1,305) and would certainly qualify as retail investors. We don’t know what proportion of UK investors use crypto derivatives, but we do know that the worldwide trade in these financial products was nearly a fifth of the total crypto market in 2019 (and has been growing rapidly in 2020).

Yet retail investors are probably not the main users of derivatives. Trading site eToro said earlier this year that maybe only a tenth of their retail investor spend was on this segment. And with most of the UK contingent using non-UK based exchanges, it’s easy enough to avoid FCA jurisdiction. The FCA says the ban could reduce annual losses and fees to investors by between GBP 19m and GBP 101m.

The ban also doesn’t make much difference at a worldwide level. The UK crypto market is small beer compared to global cryptocurrency holdings, which are worth around USD 400bn. You would not, therefore, have expected the FCA ban to have a material detrimental impact on the price of bitcoin or leading alternative coins like ethereum, and sure enough, it didn’t. In fact, it was widely expected by industry observers and had arguably already been priced in.

Volatility and excessive risk

The fact that the price of bitcoin is very volatile has historically been the scourge of this sector, with many specialists repeatedly saying that this prevents it from serving as a store of value and becoming a functional currency. You could argue that banning some derivatives trading has the potential to reduce this volatility.

When people buy derivatives, they can be highly levered, meaning that they are borrowing to increase the size of their trade to make greater potential gains (or losses). Many exchanges, typically in Asia, allow investors to borrow 15 times the size of the trade, while some offer over 100 times leverage.

When trades are leveraged, investors enter and exit the market more quickly, since their loss or gain is multiplied by the proportion they have borrowed. It’s this effect on the market that increases price volatility. Yet bitcoin has lately been trading at an all-time low for volatility, so the ban may not achieve much in this respect.

None of this is to say that the ban is meaningless. Derivatives make markets more efficient by allowing investors to hedge their bets, so even a partial ban in one major country has to be seen as a step backwards for cryptocurrencies. There is also a bigger danger for the industry that other leading global financial regulators such as the SEC in the US and BaFin in Germany may follow suit.

This damage could be greatly aggravated if the US or other authorities were to indict other unregistered exchanges like BitMEX. That could cause a liquidity crisis as investors withdrew their money en masse. Again, we will have to wait and see what happens. BitMEX said that around 30% of customer funds have been withdrawn since the US issued charges, but insisted it is open for “business as usual”.

But as far as the UK ban is concerned, I would argue on balance that curtailing excessive risk-taking by amateur traders in a sector where trading vanilla cryptocurrencies is risky enough seems logical. I have met many “retail investors” in crypto whose depth of knowledge is refreshing, far exceeding that of financial institutions, but there will certainly be others who don’t understand their risks.

To end on a positive note, part of the FCA’s reasoning for the ban was that there was “no reliable basis” for valuing cryptocurrencies. It did not say there was no value in cryptocurrencies. That is a noticeable shift from what regulators might have said in the past, and is a sign that bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted.

Crypto Exchange is a high-tech platform in which all trade transactions are conducted using modern software created based on the latest IT solutions. The emergence of new types of currencies, in particular, cryptocurrencies, gives a chance for the rapid development of the world economy as a whole. In turn, structural changes in the international economic system gave impetus to the emergence and development of new types of exchange technologies.

Thus, crypto exchanges appeared which allowed its participants anywhere in the world to buy, sell and exchange one cryptocurrency for others, or for the fiat of other countries. Each crypto exchange tries to offer customers convenient ways to convert financial instruments and provides the ability to conduct transactions on its own terms. The high rates of development and distribution of cryptocurrencies, which are based on Blockchain, as well as the gradual wide recognition by the world community and leading economists, ensure the further improvement of exchange technologies. This means that in an effort to provide the most comfortable conditions for its customers, each crypto exchange will take them to an ever-higher quality level of service with innovative nuances. But at the same time, within the framework of the technological process of stock trading, which is available to users (from professional traders to amateurs), the question of psychology and its role in the decision making has not been canceled. Successful trading depends on 70% primarily on the psychology of a trader and only 30% on the trading scheme/strategy.

Trading on the exchange, it is necessary to develop discipline, self-control and be able to respond quickly to changing stock charts. All of this will allow you to earn and minimize your losses more effectively. Everyone should remember, from the amateur to the professional, that in the financial markets you can not only earn money but also lose money. Cryptocurrency rates are still subject to political and regulatory influences; their value is influenced by the reputation of the company’s founders, informational insertions about blockchain projects and plans for their further development, scandals, and disclosures. Nevertheless, there are simple rules for successful trading from the field of psychology, which will reduce the risks when trying to make money on cryptocurrency and not only. There are a number of problems that always hinder every beginner — amateur:

Excitement

Fear

Greed

Unwillingness to learn new things

Imaginary visualization of results

All these problems have psychological aspects. Emotions, feelings, and desires significantly influence the trading decisions made by the trader. This happens all the time, not only on traditional exchanges but also in the cryptocurrency sphere as well. Excitement is an emotional state when it seems to a person that he is lucky, and as the series of successful transactions continues, he performs larger by volume financial transactions. Often, the excitement motivates to turn away from long-term transactions and trends and look towards short-term operations. After all, it seems that the more often you successfully complete operations, the more capital you earn. Not at all! The more often you make mistakes, leading to a default on your account. Money only is earned on long-term trends and operations. Traders are often worried, fearing an unsuccessful deal closing.

Of course, a loss is bad, but sometimes it is better to close a position in minus than to lose a large amount only because of the hope of a quick price reversal. Therefore, fear often pushes for the wrong strategic decisions. Fear of loss, as a result, becomes a sentence for your positioning in profit. On the same face with fear, if not strange, is the factor of greed. Having essentially a different source of inspiration, greed, like fear, leads to a generally pitiable result — to the default of your trading account. The reluctance to learn new strategies, technologies and denial of forecasting also leads to failure. Successful is who always strives to learn new things, and perceives the fact and necessity of continuous learning. Since learning is a process of striving for the progress of its results and professional qualities. Another scourge — Wishlist or visualization. Everyone wants to see the price move in the right direction. This is pretty dangerous. By visualizing the price jump in the right direction, you can dream and invest too much in cryptocurrency. This will lead to losses.

Here you should always remember to diversify your investments. Remember your psychological portrait even when you program your trading strategies, algorithms, and bots. After all, your algorithm is essentially your psychological portrait. Finally, the above-mentioned flaws, especially in the strategy can dominate and damage your deposit and reputation. The main signs of competent crypto-trade are the same as on other exchanges (such as FOREX). This is a kind of algorithm for a sustainable profit strategy:

Risk no more than 10% of the deposit

Use risk per trade of 5% or less

Do not close profitable deals too early

Do not accumulate losing trades

Fix quick speculative profit

Respect the trend

Pay more attention to liquid assets (cryptocurrency)

Set your personal entry and exit rules for trades and stick to them

A long-term trading strategy gives you maximum steady profits

Do not use the principles of Martingale tactics if there is no experience.

You cannot double the volume of the transaction if it closed in the red zone. If a loss was incurred, then the cryptocurrency market situation was predicted incorrectly and it was necessary to work on improving the analytical skills, and not to conclude a larger deal, which probably also closes in the negative

It is obvious that the psychology of trading significantly affects the performance of stock speculation both in the traditional market and in the field of cryptocurrency. It is important to remember that the success of a person in any field of activity depends on the emotional component, namely the internal balance. Exchange trading is a nervous activity, and if you do not learn to take emotions under control, the results can be disastrous. The basis for achieving success in stock trading, in my opinion, are two fundamental factors. The first factor relates to the field of formulation of the trading idea, and the second — to the area of its implementation.

To formulate a trading idea, on the one hand, methods of technical and fundamental analysis are used to select an exchange instrument and determine the moment of opening and closing a position on it. On the other hand, capital management methods are used to determine the optimal size of the position being opened. As you know, without these two crucial moments it is impossible to achieve stable success in stock trading. As experience shows, for the most part, people have enough intelligence to master all the necessary theoretical knowledge of technical and fundamental analysis in a few months of intensive training. There are no special intellectual difficulties. But, as the same experience shows, this is clearly not enough for successful exchange trading, since all knowledge may turn out to be a useless load if the second success factor is not sufficiently present — the practical implementation of trading ideas, which is no longer based on the intellectual sphere, and psycho-emotional. It is within this area that the main problem arises for many traders, which prevents the receipt of stable profits. As a rule, this is due to the psycho-emotional profile of a person. It depends on how the trader will behave in the psychologically stressful situations that the exchange trading is full of. Inherent in all human emotions and feelings — fear, greed, excitement, envy, hope, etc. very often have a decisive influence on the behavior of traders, not allowing them to follow strictly the trading strategy and plan, even if they have one. From a psychological point of view, the process of stock exchange activity can be divided into stages, after which the trader can return to the starting point. The above scenarios and risk factors are one of the options for the behavior of an exchange speculator; however, it often happens exactly the opposite. Having suffered losses from his first transactions in the market, the trader loses interest in exchange trading, he gives up and he falls into despair. In this case, the first step to victory is the admission of defeat. It would seem silly and ridiculous, but it works. After that, there are two options: either the trader leaves the exchange forever, or returns to the battlefield. Such “returns” may occur more than once. In addition, at some other time, after repeated analysis of his actions, mistakes made and their consequences, a person from a beginner begins to turn into an experienced trader, which is marked by the stability of his activity and, perhaps, by slow, but surely growth of his deposit and profit. The psychological basis for success in trading, which leads to victory and the absence of which is equivalent to defeat, are as follows:

It is not only the lack of self-control, discipline and focuses on the process that causes the defeat

Self-control, discipline, and ability to concentrate is not enough to achieve success

To achieve success, it is equally important to be able to adapt to changes.

In principle, one can consider the idea that traditional approaches to the psychology of trading are limited. In the majority of benefits for traders, the key qualities necessary for successful exchange trading are only self-control and discipline. Of course, these qualities are necessary for any field of business activities. Trading is not an exception, especially considering that it is in the risk zone. But self-control and discipline are not enough to achieve success. Trading is a business. Moreover, any business does not stand still. You cannot find a formula for success and use it forever. You will need to monitor trends and constantly look for new successful solutions.

The main feature of a successful trader is adaptability to changes. The lack of development leads to defeat, large monetary losses. Many technology companies continued to produce stationary computers when laptops became popular. The same companies continued to produce laptops when tablets appeared and became popular. The products of these companies were of high quality, and their employees organized pre-set tasks in an organized manner. But they lost large sums due to the fact that they could not adapt to changes in demand. If we draw a parallel with the sphere of investment, the similarities will become noticeable. The stock market, like any other subject to change. One period is replaced by another. Those methods that allowed achieving success in the previous period can lead to failure in the current. The key concept in stock trading is volatility. The change in this indicates the onset of a new period. When volatility increases, the trade becomes riskier. Accordingly, with a decrease in this indicator, the degree of risk during trading operations decreases. With a high level of volatility, trends most often unfold. Strong and weak positions can be swapped out. With a high level of volatility, trends continue for some time. From the foregoing, it should be concluded that market processes and methods during periods of high and low volatility differ strongly. You cannot use the same methods during changing market trends. Often it is the adherence to the previous methods, excessive discipline leads to collapse as well. The fact that the investor was defeated does not mean that he suddenly became morally unstable, unorganized. Trading is trading.

Therefore, we have every right to assert that under the psychology of trade in the markets is meant human preparedness for the risks that inevitably accompany any activity. Trading on the stock exchange is based on the interaction of the three most important components: capital management, analysis, and the psychology of trading (which cannot be considered in conjunction with the other aspects of trading). The psychology of human behavior is a source for understanding what is happening in financial markets. The source for understanding the events occurring in the financial markets and the behavior of traders during exchange trading is the psychology of the human person. Emotions — greed, fear, doubt, hope, a sense of self-preservation — are peculiar to any person in life — are clearly manifested in the hard rhythm of decision-making during the dynamic course of exchange trading (which was partially considered above). Knowledge of human psychology and their behavioral characteristics must be used to achieve success. The psychology of a trader is formed from a multitude of grains — it is a belief in what one does in the stock market, in one’s actions, in own system of one’s decisions, in the trading method. In addition, the psychology of a trader is that one can unload oneself emotionally, one does not accept the intellectual challenge that the stock market carries. On the contrary, becomes restrained, calm when making decisions on operations in the stock market. There are many situations where a trader expresses his attention and focus; he does not disperse it on the tracking of news factors or on the receipt of stimuli from the news agencies. Consequently, the crowd psychology is the factor that makes prices move, therefore, in addition to assessing one’s own psychological state, one must be sensitive to changes in the mood of other market participants, move in the flow, not against it, and then success will not take long.

Of course, you can argue that why do I need this psychology? After all, besides creating your own strategies and individual work, some exchanges (including crypto exchanges) allow minimizing risks by following the strategies of experienced traders; this service is called a PAMM account. PAMM provides an opportunity for clients (Subscribers) to follow the trading strategy of experienced and professional traders (Providers). Provider’s trading results are publicly available. With the help of the rating of accounts, graphs of profitability and reviews of other traders, you can choose the most suitable Provider and begin to follow his strategy. Again, in this case, the provider is a human with all the ensuing consequences. And psychological aspects are not foreign to professionals as well, including victories and mistakes. The financial market attracts people the possibility of obtaining independence, including financial. A successful trader can live and work in any country in the world without having either a boss or subordinates. The motivation of people on the exchanges can be different: from getting a higher percentage than from a bank to making several thousand dollars a day. At the same time, there are two main categories of people in the financial market (including cryptocurrencies): investors who acquire assets or currency for a relatively long period, and speculators who profit from changes in the prices of certain assets for short periods. Many believe an easy way to make money is not for everybody. First, the skillful use and manipulation of the psychological aspects of a human make it possible to become a speculator. And this, of course, in addition to knowledge and analytical skills. Experience shows that successful speculation is the right state of mind. It would seem that this is the simplest thing that can be acquired by a human. But in fact, this self-tuning is available to very few. It is also necessary to distinguish the psychology of the market and the personal psychology of the trader. The behavior of the market as a whole depends on people since it is the stock market crowd that determines its direction. However, quite often traders lose sight of the most important component of victory — managing their personal emotions, that is, their psychology. Without control over oneself, there can be no control over one’s trading capital. If a trader is not tuned to the trend range of the stock crowd, if he does not pay attention to changes in her psychology, then he will also not achieve significant success in trading. To succeed in the exchange, one needs to take a sober look at exchange trading, recognize its trends and their changes, and not waste time on dreams or lamenting about failures.

Any price of a financial instrument is a momentary agreement on its value, reached by a market crowd and expressed in the fact of a transaction, i.e. it is the equilibrium point between the players for a rise and a fall, or the “equilibrium” price. Crowds of traders create asset prices: buyers, sellers, and fluctuating market watchers. Charts of prices and trading volumes reflect the psychology of the exchange. In addition, this is always worth remembering! After all, the main purpose of the presence of the analysis of psychology in stock trading is not the quantity, but the quality of transactions. A person striving to become a good trader needs to remember the words of DiNapoli, a well-known stock exchange trader: “The most important trading tool is not a computer, not a service for supplying information, or even methods developed by a trader. It is he himself! If a trader is not suitable for this — he should not trade at all”! Therefore, before pushing orders on the trading platform, think about whether you are suitable for this role.

Bitcoin’s price was riding high Monday, going up to $13,250 on spot exchanges like Bitstamp before dropping as low as $12,773 around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

John Willock, CEO of crypto liquidity provider Tritum, said the bitcoin market can stay near its current price point, although some traders participated in profit-taking Monday.

“I think that it is possible to keep around $13,000 for the short term,” said Willock. “There will likely be some traders looking to close out longs from the recent run-up that might cause a minor retrenchment,” he added.

However, Consantin Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, said bitcoin had positive momentum going for it before its abrupt drop in price, and that more is to come. “We must take into account that a correction is already brewing,” he said.“I think it will happen this week.”

Major global stock indices are also down Monday amid COVID-19 uncertainty.

“When macro issues happen, it affects the entire market and not just one asset class,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “Hopes for stimulus are dimming while coronavirus cases are ticking upwards in America and around the world. This is causing countries to shut down things again, which will cause the economy to contract further.”

While bitcoin has dipped when equities slump of late, the bellwether of cryptocurrency has performed much, much better than stocks over the balance of 2020.

Despite the price drop Monday, the bitcoin derivatives market is still signaling bullishness, according to Cindy Leow, partner at multi-strategy crypto firm 256 Capital. “The market sentiment is starting to grow more exuberant with call options with a $50,000 strike by end of year being listed on Deribit, and futures are starting to heat up,” Leow said.

Indeed, funding rates on futures are still mostly positive on futures exchanges, which means long-oriented traders continue to pay for leverage liquidity to make bullish bets.

Ether fees keep dropping

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday trading around $391 and slipping 4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

On Saturday, Oct. 24, the average daily network fees on Ethereum hit 0.00223399 ETH, a low not seen since July 12 and beating the previous October 17 low. Ethereum network fees hit a 2020 high as recently as September, and a record $166 million was paid out to miners during that month.

Yield farmer “devops199fan”, a longtime active participant finding profit opportunities in decentralized finance, or DeFi, said he expects more positive expected volume, or EV, with fees dropping. “I actually think this is good for yield farming,” he told CoinDesk, “because it means more opportunities are positive EV since the fees are lower.”

Bitcoin is a store of value, like ""digital gold,"" and will unlikely be used as traditional currency for the next five years, the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told Bloomberg.

The Bitcoin bull expects the digital currency's price to keep rising as more people pile into the idea of adding it to their portfolios.

He expects several banks and credit-card companies to catch up to PayPal's recent decision to allow customers to transact in cryptocurrencies.

""It's no longer a debate if crypto is a thing, if Bitcoin is an asset, if the blockchain is going to be part of the financial infrastructure,"" Novogratz said. ""It's not 'if', it's 'when', and so every single company has to have a plan now.""

Bitcoin is like ""digital gold"" and won't be used in the same way as traditional currency for at least the next five years, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz told Bloomberg on Friday.

""I don't think Bitcoin is going to be used as a transactional currency anytime in the next five years,"" the bitcoin bull said in an interview with Bloomberg TV and Radio. ""Bitcoin is being used as a store of value.""

Bitcoin is still a relatively small asset class, mostly favored by millennial investors who aren't as influential in the financial markets yet, as the older generations that have typically opted for physical gold as a store of wealth.

Novogratz, who has long favored the widespread adoption of digital currencies, believes that while Bitcoin could see further upside, it will not be used for daily transactions anytime soon.

""Bitcoin as a gold, as digital gold, is just going to keep going higher,"" the former hedge-fund manager said. ""More and more people are going to want it as some portion of their portfolio.""

Bitcoin has surged over 14% in the last week, hitting $13,169 on Monday. The rally was sharply driven by US digital payments firm PayPal announcing that it would allow customers to buy and hold cryptocurrencies.

The size of the cryptocurrency market has grown to around $397.9 billion, from around $195 billion at the start of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin is, by far, the largest digital coin in circulation, with a market cap of $244 billion and accounts for around 61% of the total market.

Novogratz said PayPal's decision last week was ""the biggest news of the year in crypto.""

He expects all banks to catch up in the race to service crypto products. Companies including E*Trade Financial, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express can be expected to follow suit ""within a year,"" he told Bloomberg.

""It's no longer a debate if crypto is a thing, if Bitcoin is an asset, if the blockchain is going to be part of the financial infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's not if, it's when, and so every single company has to have a plan now.""

At press time, it’s at $13,070.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, moved from $375 at the beginning of the week to a $420 high before enduring a slight correction. It’s trading at $405 at press time.

Headlines this week were dominated by an announcement from PayPal Holdings revealing a new service that allows its customers to “buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account.” In its announcement, the firm revealed PayPal plans to “significantly increase cryptocurrency’s utility by making it available as a funding source for purchases at its 26 million merchants worldwide.”

The new service will let PayPal users buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin and will for now only be available in the United States. The company is planning to “expand the features to Venmo and select international markets in the first half of 2021.”

PayPal’s move came after fintech startup Mode Global Goldings PLC (“Mode”) announced it had become the first publicly listed company in the United Kingdom to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

Mode was founded in 2019 and incorporated in August 2020 to “build a next-gen ecosystem that combines the best of banking, payments, investments, loyalty, and digital assets.” The exact value of its bitcoin holdings wasn’t revealed, although it “allocated up to ten percent of its cash reserves to purchase Bitcoin.”

Mode adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset after business intelligence firm MicroStrategy acquired “a total of 38,250 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $425 million” back in September, and after Jack Dorsey’s Square announced it “purchased $50 million in bitcoin” earlier this month.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a Managing Director at J.P. Morgan who works on Global Market Strategy, published this week a report on the long-term potential of BTC, detailing the cryptocurrency is competing with gold. These developments have seen the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which is based on an analysis of “emotions and sentiments from different sources,” enter the “Extreme Greed” category.

As the price of bitcoin moved up to the $13,000 mark, 98% of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are currently in a state of profit, a level that hasn’t been seen since December 2017, when the price of BTC was at an all-time high near $20,000. An unspent transaction output refers to the BTC remaining after a transaction was executed, similar to the change received after a cash transaction.

Crypto Asset Manager Sees $1.4 Billion Inflows in October

Cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments has seen its assets under management (AUM) swell by over $1.4 billion so far in October, bringing the total to over $7.3 billion, from $5.9 billion at the beginning of the month.

The inflows come after the firm posted a record quarter in which it raised a total of $1.05 billion, making it the “largest capital inflow in a single quarter in the firm’s history.” In its report, Grayscale detailed that in Q3 of this year institutional investors accounted for 81% of the inflows.

Canadian investment manager 3iQ has seen its public bitcoin fund, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, hit a new milestone after it surpassed the $100 million market cap. Called The Bitcoin Fund, it’s Canada’s first crypto fund listed on a major stock exchange and works as an exchange-traded product (ETP) as it gives investors exposure to its underlying asset.

Institutional investors aren’t the only ones interested in cryptoassets. The hackers that breached the security of Singapore-based exchange KuCoin have moved $1.25 million in ETH to a transaction mixer in a bid to hide their tracks from blockchain sleuths. The volume is so large they may make the work of law enforcement agencies easier by making up the majority of the funds in the mixer.

In an odd turn this week, those behind the Darkside ransomware group have donated some of the BTC they extorted to two charities: The Water Project and Children International. Both charities received 0.88 BTC (worth $10,000 at the time of the donation), but Children’s International quickly claimed they have “no intention of keeping” the donation if the funds are indeed stolen.

But the most drama in crypto markets came after an exploit of the decentralized finance protocol Harvest Finance sent the platform’s native FARM token tumbling by 65% in less than an hour.

In traditional markets, European stocks slid as Spain declared a COVID-19 state of emergency and Italians were urged to stay home. U.S. equity futures pointed to a lower open on signs of a resurgence in the coronavirus and dimming hopes for a big stimulus package prior to the election. Gold was little changed.

Market moves

Bitcoin bulls are accustomed to the put-downs. The largest cryptocurrency has been lambasted in recent years as a “fraud” for having ” basically no value” and for failing to qualify as “a suitable investment.”

Now, as bitcoin mounts what might be its most durable rally in almost three years, the bulls may have to get used to a new sensation: vindication.

Analysts for JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, wrote Friday in a report that bitcoin has “considerable” price upside in the long term, as reported by CoinDesk’s Zack Voell.

Bitcoin’s increasing use as an alternative to gold is amplified by millennials’ interest in cryptocurrency, according to the report, written by JPMorgan’s global quantitative and derivatives strategy team.

“Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here,” the analysts wrote.

Such plaudits from the biggest of big U.S. banks represent a remarkable milestone for a digital asset launched in early 2009 with the specific aim of eliminating middlemen in payment systems.

And it’s pretty hard to resist dredging up JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s memorable remark in 2017 that bitcoin was a “fraud.”

“If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day,” Dimon said at the time.

Lately, that price just keeps going up, buoyed by the growing belief among many crypto investors that bitcoin might serve as a hedge against trillions of dollars of central bank money printing.

Bitcoin has climbed 82% in 2020, and it has doubled in value since Dimon made the disparaging remark in October 2017. Those who bought the cryptocurrency are looking smart compared with shareholders in JPMorgan, whose shares have tumbled 26% in 2020, leaving the stock price roughly where it stood three years ago.

Bitcoin’s technical charts are showing signs of temporary bull fatigue.

The cryptocurrency carved out a spinning top candle on Sunday, which occurs when an asset sees two-way price action during a specific period. It is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace, especially when it appears following a notable rally, which is the case here.

The candle validates signals from another technical indicator, the 14-day relative strength index, where its reading of over 70 suggests the market is overbought. The immediate support is seen at $12,500 (horizontal line on the daily chart).

Dips could be short-lived, as the cryptocurrency’s long-term bull case has been bolstered by the online payments giant PayPal’s recent decision to announce support for bitcoin.

Also, several top public companies have recently disclosed their bitcoin holdings, providing a strong vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future.

Besides, the recent rally from $10,000 to $13,300 is backed by increased accumulation by large investors and looks sustainable.

As of Sunday, the whale population – clusters of addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – rose to 1,939, the highest since September 2016, according to data source Glassnode.

Tweet of the Day",2020-10-26 12:50:11+00:00,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ethereum-is-available-for-retirement-accounts-with-bitcoin-ira-301159384.html,"LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin IRA, the world's first, largest and most secure digital asset IRA technology platform that allows clients to purchase cryptocurrencies and other digital assets for their retirement accounts, today released several new guides to help educate individuals about Ethereum and its highly anticipated upgrade to version ""Ethereum 2.0.""

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency with an estimated marketcap at over $40 billion. Like the internet, Ethereum is ""open-sourced"" and it's decentralized so it's not controlled by any government entity. But unlike Bitcoin, it offers ""smart contracts"" which make it programmable. This revolutionary technology enables developers to build real-world applications on top of the network, dramatically expanding its use cases. Today, Ethereum has over 25 billion in monthly transactions from applications built on top of the network including decentralized crypto exchanges, ""stable coins,"" lending and borrowing apps from decentralized finance (""DeFi""), gaming, digital collectibles, and more.

In the next few weeks, developers will be launching the largest upgrade to Ethereum's network since it launched over 5 years ago. The goal of the upgrade is to increase its security by moving to ""Proof of Stake"" and increase its scalability to eventually handle more transactions per second than Visa and other major payment processors. The upgrade will also enable more casual investors to become validators to help secure the network and earn a reward for doing so.

To help individuals better understand Ethereum and its applications, Bitcoin IRA has developed a few new resource guides:

Ethereum Investing - Your easy 3-minute guide to understanding Ethereum

Ethereum 2.0 - An overview to the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since its launch

Ethereum Price Predictions - A summary of what experts are saying about the price of Ether

Ethereum Staking - How individuals can earn interest by holding Ether

Overall, Ethereum is an exciting digital asset with a rich development roadmap which can offer enormous potential for long-term investors.

",,https://qz.com/africa/1922466/how-bitcoin-powered-nigerias-endsars-protests/,"After initially existing mainly as a recurring hashtag on social media, #EndSARS—a campaign against police brutality in Nigeria—evolved into mass protests which drew thousands of Nigerians across in several locations across the country this month.

With the protests growing organically and quickly across cities all over the country, the need for funding—to cover food and water for protesters as well as medical supplies and hospital bills when necessary—soon became clear. And calls for funding through donation drives were answered quickly as Nigerians at home and abroad began sending cash through local banks and online payment methods in a bid to fund what had become the largest protests in about a decade.

But a hiccup soon emerged.

Feminist Coalition, a gender equality group that had been founded just weeks earlier and had become one of the key organizations accepting donations for protests, began to notice bank transactions were being slowed down while its online payment links to facilitate donations had stopped working. While the Nigerian government has maintained a lack of involvement, the widespread suspicion was that the disruption of donation accounts and methods was the result of pressure from “high up.”

While the move may have proven to be a death-knell for the donation drive a decade ago, it only proved a temporary setback: Feminist Coalition began accepting donations through bitcoin instead and received support from bitcoin advocate, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter.

The move was in keeping with an overarching theme of the protests which had seen young, internet-savvy Nigerians leverage digital tools to drive and sustain their campaign against establishment institutions, from building online teams to respond to legal issues like arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention of protesters to using social media channels to debunk misinformation spread by government actors and traditional media.

As of Oct. 22, when Feminist Coalition stopped taking donations in light of a government curfew which had effectively ended physical protests in Lagos, its summary of accounts showed a bitcoin balance that accounted for around 40% of the $387,000 raised in total.

That total is remarkable for a country where digital transactions still come a distant second place to cash in the day-to-day economy, which is still dominated by the informal sector.

Over the past decade, bitcoin has become the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency used both as a medium of exchange and storage of value. While bitcoin’s adoption has happened much faster in Europe and North America, it has also been gaining more traction across Africa as users on the continent increasingly adopt it to get around the difficulties of international transactions including digital payments.

Given how it was used to keep funding for the protests alive, the protests inadvertently showcased a use-case for bitcoin in a market where it is increasingly being adopted but still remains quite synonymous with fraud. It showed Nigerians bitcoin wasn’t just something used by scammers, says Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful, a global peer to peer bitcoin marketplace which counts Nigeria as a leading market. “Now people are starting to see its real utility. It shows people the full spectrum of what bitcoin can do.”

The association with scams in Nigeria stems from when Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox, an infamous Russian Ponzi scheme which saw Nigerians lose around $50 million when it first crashed, attempted a comeback by using bitcoin as a payment method.

And it’s a link that remains despite the growing local use of bitcoin to facilitate cross-border trade and as a medium for remittances, not just in Nigeria but across the continent. In fact, fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms received just over $8 million from users in Africa in June alone, according to research by Chainalysis, a blockchain market intelligence firm.

There are crypto investors, who became overnight billionaires. No, cryptocurrencies are not a get-rich-quick scheme. They are a new asset class, which offer substantial profits. However, the volatility in the crypto market scares many investors, especially the ones, who are set in their ways with traditional assets. High returns, on the other hand, attract them. So, are they worth the investment? Here’s what you need to know:

How are cryptocurrencies different?

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, underpinned by distributed ledger technology -- the most secure technology existence. While they can serve as a medium of exchange, they are an investment class for people to trade and gain profits.





Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrency’s supply is limited and they aren’t regulated by any central authorities. Their value is determined by people who trade them, rather than any institution.





Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created during the 2008 financial crisis and since then its performance has attracted investors from all over the world. While many other cryptocurrencies such as Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, Libra (recently proposed by Facebook), etc. emerged over the years, Bitcoin still dominates the market. Based on CoinMarketCap data, the value of Bitcoins alone in the world was $160.4 billion as of March 4, 2020.

Why are they volatile?

As stated earlier, they are not controlled by any central authorities. It’s up to speculators to drive prices upward or downward. While cryptocurrencies are slowly making a leap towards the mainstream, they are newer than any other assets. Historically, the common asset classes of today such as gold and real estate were also volatile in their early days. It took them years to stabilize around the world and the same is true for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Is it a good idea to invest in cryptocurrencies now?

The number of visitors and traders on cryptocurrency exchange platforms is growing by the day. In India, since the Supreme Court lifted the ban on the trade of cryptocurrency, the market is seeing higher crypto demand and trade volumes than usual.





It’s not hard to see why shrewd investors are allocating a portion of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. No investment is a safe bet. While risk associated with cryptocurrency indeed exceeds that of any other investment class, so do their returns. It has shown a growth of over 1000% over the last decade. According to Finder.com, Bitcoins will thrive in 2020 and are expected to reach highs of $15,499 per unit by the year-end.





Besides high returns, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer ease and a greater degree of independence to investors. Both entry and participation in the crypto market are easy. Unlike markets for several other assets, the cryptocurrency market doesn’t have a very high entry threshold, i.e., investors don't need to have a significant amount of money at their disposal to enter the market. Also, there is no need to visit banks and sign a ton of papers. Investors can just create an account, get a wallet, and easily track their assets.





Also, their value can’t be manipulated. Governments can print an unlimited amount of fiat money and they do so to boost the economy. When there is excessive money in the economy, inflation occurs, reducing the value of the money in your pocket and other correlated assets.





However, cryptocurrency’s supply is limited, making them anti-inflationary assets. They have performed extremely well in countries facing rampant hyperinflation. For instance, countries such as Venezuela or Argentina, where inflation rates are absurdly high, have benefitted from the use of cryptocurrency.





While there are many crypto billionaires, some people lost a fortune because they simply weren’t wise investors. According to experts, the wisest thing to do is to risk as much money as you can afford to lose.





While allocating a portion of your investment portfolio to cryptos, it's important you do your research thoroughly, follow the right strategy, and create a well-balanced portfolio. If you use a legitimate crypto exchange platform, your money is safe and can be accessed at all times.





Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, decentralised in nature, are not directly impacted by ongoing social, geopolitical, and economic issues. This explains why they have outperformed every other asset class in times of crisis. Now seems like a good time to include some in your portfolio.",2020-10-27 14:17:11.837000+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/why-paypals-bitcoin-support-is-a-big-deal/,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) will soon allow you to buy and sell cryptocurrency on its app. The payments company will expand the service to Venmo, and eventually, allow users to use their crypto to make purchases at the over 26 million merchants that accept PayPal. The announcement was viewed as a positive for both PayPal and bitcoin investors.

Here's why there's a lot to like about PayPal's embrace of cryptocurrency.

Increased engagement

The ability to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on PayPal's platform should lead to increased engagement with its services. CEO Dan Schulman wants PayPal to have daily utility, and that starts with getting users to think about it more often.

Rival Square (NYSE:SQ) has successfully increased engagement by adding additional features like bitcoin trading to its Cash App. Management notes that users who take advantage of features like bitcoin trading are also sending more money via its platform, spending more on their Cash Card, and using other monetizable features in Cash App.

PayPal eventually aims to go a step beyond where Square is now by giving users the ability to pay for any purchases using their cryptocurrency holdings. Behind the scenes, the company will actually liquidate the cryptocurrency and send fiat currency to the merchants, but users will be able to store their funds as cryptocurrency up until they want to spend it. The option for such seamless transactions could lead to cryptocurrency fans making more frequent use of PayPal.

The fintech company isn't taking a commission nor looking to earn anything off the spread from those who trade bitcoin on its platform. It can facilitate cryptocurrency trading for free and make its money on the uplift in transactions on its payments network.

Diving deeper into cryptocurrency

Giving people the ability to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrency for payments through PayPal looks like just the first step here. ""The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable,"" Schulman said in the press release announcing the new features. The CEO said he wants PayPal to ""meaningfully contribute to shaping the role that digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.""

PayPal has been picking up the pace with its introduction of new products and features recently, and it's willing to spend to further its growth. During the company's second-quarter earnings call, CFO John Rainey said it'll spend an additional $300 million in the second half of 2020 ""to advance our key priorities and accelerate our growth initiatives.""

To that end, PayPal is also exploring the acquisition of cryptocurrency companies. It's reportedly interested in bitcoin custodian BitGo, according to Bloomberg. It's currently partnering with BitGo's competitor Paxos Trust, to enable the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies.

PayPal may also explore developing its own cryptocurrency. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) tried to launch a digital currency last year, Libra, in order to facilitate commerce on its social networks. PayPal initially backed the project along with a couple dozen other companies, but it backed away after Facebook started facing regulatory issues with Libra, halting its progress.

A cryptocurrency may make more sense for PayPal. Cryptocurrencies can speed up transactions, particularly cross-border transactions, while reducing their cost. A PayPal cryptocurrency would also reduce its dependence on traditional banking and payments partners.

That could enable PayPal to lower its fees and increase its profit margins. Considering the company facilitates hundreds of billions of dollars in payments every year, even a small margin improvement on them would have a massive impact on its bottom line.

There's a lot of potential for combining the utility of cryptocurrency with PayPal's expansive network of consumers and merchants. With its strong free cash flow, PayPal has the funds to acquire companies in the space and spend money on developing new technology, so it could move fast if it sees good results with the features it just announced.",2020-10-27 00:00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/is-paypals-crypto-announcement-really-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/,"Last week, payments giant PayPal lit the cryptosphere ablaze with the announcement that it would be allowing its users to purchase, sell, and hold a number of cryptocurrencies on its platform. Specifically, the new features, which are to be launched in ‘the coming weeks’, allow users to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

The announcement is largely cited as the primary cause behind a boost in Bitcoin prices that began in the latter half of last week. Last Tuesday, Bitcoin sat around $11,800. However, by Wednesday, BTC had climbed above $12,000. Since then, BTC has spent much of the last five days above $13,000.

At the same time, bullish analysts are joyfully crying that PayPal’s adoption of Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies is the long-awaited push that crypto has needed to break out into the ‘mainstream’ financial world.

But is the PayPal announcement really all it is cracked up to be?

“With Almost 350 Million Active Users, PayPal’s Decision Will Increase Interest in Cryptocurrency across the World.”

Brian Estes, Founder of Off the Chain Capital, a cryptocurrency sector fund with $40 million AUM, told Finance Magnates that indeed, the company’s decisive entrance into the crypto world is deeply significant for adoption.

Estes said that this latest move by the company, which also operates mobile payments service Venmo, “represents the next step towards adoption.”

He explained that according to the S-Curve Analysis model, which can be used to chart the adoption of new kinds of technology, crypto adoption is on the rise. Approximately 15 percent of US citizens own cryptocurrency today; Estes predicts that crypto “will reach 90% of US households by 2029.”

“A company of this size and stature entering the market is a logical progression on the S-Curve Analysis model,” he said.

A representative of cryptocurrency purchasing platform, Xcoins.com also pointed out to Finance Magnates that the sheer size of PayPal’s user base could significantly raise the number of individuals and families that are exposed to cryptocurrency in the relatively near future.

“With almost 350 million active users, PayPal’s decision will increase interest in cryptocurrency across the world,” Xcoins.com said. “PayPal has said that they are making this move now as a consequence of growing Central Bank developments across the planet to create new digital coins.”

PayPal’s Announcement Will Not Necessarily Cause More People to ‘Buy Stuff with Bitcoin’

However, while PayPal’s recent announcement may not be anything to shake a stick at, other analysts question whether or not the crypto world should believe the hype.

After all, CoinDesk author, Noelle Acheson pointed out that the ‘buying stuff with crypto’ use case is not one that seems to have gained much traction (perhaps with the exception of the purchase of illicit materials.)

Indeed, “the investment use case became more predominant,” Acheson wrote. Therefore, “why would people spend an investment asset, forgoing any potential gain?”

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

While it may be true that Bitcoin is much easier as a financial instrument for online purchases in some places in the world, such as Nigeria, Acheson said that “just because the service is now available does not mean that people will use it in significant numbers.”

Additionally, the act of selling and purchasing things with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does not necessarily boost the value of Bitcoin over the long term, since many merchants, who opt to receive payments in BTC, simply cash out of the coin as soon as it is received, perhaps paying a fee to PayPal as they do so.

Will PayPal’s Announcement Increase Crypto Adoption? “Not Really.”

Indeed, when we asked Jim Angleton, President of Aegis Finserv Corporation, whether Paypal’s recent announcement will pave a pathway to true widespread adoption, his answer was simple: “not really.”

This is because while PayPal does allow users to purchase cryptocurrency and use crypto at PayPal-equipped merchants, the scope of what customers can really do with crypto on the platform is somewhat limited.

For example, crypto holders who purchase through PayPal will not have access to their own private keys. They will also be unable to transfer their crypto holdings out of their PayPal account, and they cannot send crypto to other PayPal users through the platform.

Indeed, CoinDesk’s Noelle Acheson wrote that “in other words, PayPal more or less dictates what users can do with their cryptocurrencies, and could presumably freeze accounts if they see fit, at least for now – not exactly in line with the industry’s origin and ethos.”

However, Jim Angleton believes that this could change over time, in spite of the fact that “Paypal, owned by eBay is a payment platform and was not originally conceived as a digital conveyance, mining and delivery system.”

“Judging by their reports to their State and Federal Government, we believe they have crafted this extra market in a scalable fashion,” Angleton said. “Perhaps over time when they are better experienced and have dealt with adverse issues that plague those who enter this space, you may see them offer more programs.”

“The Entire Premise of Crypto Is to Be Stealthy and Cheap. PayPal Is Neither.”

Still, in many ways, Angleton pointed out that the ethos of PayPal is contradictory to the ethos of the crypto space, a factor that may deter crypto-curious folks from using PayPal as a gateway to cryptocurrencies.

“Paypal has a good reputation and believes they will see at first a little bump in activity as some try it out, but over time, we believe because PayPal is so expensive, many fees and costs, it will downtrend,” he said. “The entire premise of crypto is to be stealthy and cheap. PayPal is neither.”

As such, Angleton emphatically believes that the ‘PayPal rally’ that is currently boosting BTC prices will not last over the long term.

“Bitcoin is facing many challenges,” he said, a factor that has caused his own company to “[drop] the bitcoin part of our digital programs in full.”

Specifically, Angleton said that Bitcoin is “not cybersecure, does not meet compliance and many other efficient operators will eat their lunch in the coming year.”

Additionally, Angleton believes that Bitcoin could see some serious challenges as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rise to prominence: “as China comes online with their Yuan Crypto, many Central Bankers and Nations will watch this launch to see if it is successful.”",2020-10-27 10:54:54+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/only-black-swan-event-may-prevent-bitcoin-rising-beyond-15000/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin just hit new yearly highs after a week-long consolidation period.

A further spike in demand could see BTC rise towards the next psychological resistance around June 2019’s high of nearly $13,900.

On-chain data shows little to no resistance above this price hurdle, suggesting that a new bull market has begun.

Bitcoin stole the crypto spotlight after slicing through a crucial resistance barrier that had been preventing it from advance further since Oct. 21.

Data reveals that if buying pressure continues to increase, prices could rise beyond $15,000.

Rising to New Yearly Highs

Bitcoin entered a consolidation period after breaking out of an ascending parallel channel on Oct. 21.

Throughout the week, prices have been contained between the $12,800 support and the $13,300 resistance level. The dormant price action forced the Bollinger bands to squeeze on BTC’s 4-hour chart, signaling that volatility was underway.

Today, a spike in the buying pressure behind the pioneer cryptocurrency allowed it to move past the overhead resistance. The sudden upswing can be considered part of the breakout that the Bollinger bands forecasted.

A further increase in demand could see Bitcoin rise towards the next psychological resistance represented by June 2019’s high of nearly $13,900.

Little to No Resistance Ahead of Bitcoin

While many market participants consider June 2019’s high as a critical area of interest, IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model suggests otherwise. Based on this on-chain metric, Bitcoin could run all the way up to $15,000 before it finds any resistance.

Here, approximately 140,000 addresses had previously purchased nearly 54,000 BTC.

When considering the massive supply barriers that lie underneath the flagship cryptocurrency, the overhead resistance seems insignificant.

Therefore, those who are looking to profit from the recent breakout must be aware that Bitcoin could be about to “teleport upwards into a full-on, FOMO induced, bull run” as on-chain analyst Willy Woo recently stated.

Regardless, the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market makes it impossible to disregard the bearish outlook. If sell orders were to pile up, triggering a sudden downswing, the range between $12,600 and $13,400 might keep falling prices at bay.

More than 1.3 million addresses are holding over 950,000 BTC around this price level.

The Singaporean multinational banking and financial services corporation DBS published an announcement revealing it was launching a cryptocurrency exchange. The announcement was later removed by the company, but crypto proponents have learned about the upcoming support for assets like bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash.

DBS Bank Ltd is Southeast Asia’s largest bank in terms of assets under management (AUM), as the corporation’s 100+ branches hold more than $600 billion today. The bank published information on the subject and then swiftly removed the announcement. However, a number of cryptocurrency proponents caught the DBS statement before the bank deleted it. The Twitter account dubbed ‘Fiat Minimalist’ tweeted a screenshot and said: “Cat’s out of the bag.”

“This has been in the works for 2 years,” Fiat Minimalist told his 2,300 followers. “All banks will have to follow suit. Imagine being bearish [toward] BTC,” he added. The announcement has also been caught in the web’s cache and is now hosted on Archive.org as well. “DBS Digital Exchange offers trading services from fiat currencies to four of the top digital currencies in circulation – Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, and XRP,” the DBS Digital Exchange website reads.

The DBS Digital Exchange page also states:

Unlike most digital exchanges today, DBS Digital Exchange does not hold any digital assets. Instead, all digital assets are kept at DBS Bank, which is globally recognised for its custodial services. To keep customers’ digital assets safe, DBS Bank has deployed DBS Digital Custody, an institutional-grade custody solution specially tailored for safekeeping digital assets.

The news about the newly created DBS Digital Exchange follows the announcement made by the payments giant Paypal last week. Additionally, in September it was revealed that U.S. banks are now allowed to hold reserves for stablecoin issuers.

The new DBS trading platform also plans to allow for security token offerings. “Companies searching for a regulated option to raise private capital from qualified investors can now tap on DBS Digital Exchange to securitise real assets into tradeable digital tokens,” DBS notes.

Furthermore, DBS thinks that cryptocurrencies are “the future of capital markets.”

“Digital assets are poised to be the future of tomorrow’s digital economy. With DBS Digital Exchange, a bank-backed digital exchange, companies, and investors can now leverage an integrated ecosystem of solutions to tap the vast potential of private markets and digital currencies,” the DBS exchange announcement concludes.

JPM Coin — a cryptocurrency JPMorgan launched last year — ""is being used commercially for the first time this week"" by a big technology client, which the bank did not identify, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The client is using the cryptocurrency for cross-border payments.

The bank also introduced a new segment devoted to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the record-keeping technology that enables cryptocurrency transactions. That segment is called Onyx.

JPMorgan hopes blockchain could reduce errors and rejections in cross-border payments by helping banks verify account information and regulatory compliance, CNBC said.

Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan's global head of wholesale payments, told CNBC he believes the world is ""shifting to a period of commercialization"" of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

The advance for the bank's cryptocurrency follows years of theorizing over the potential for bitcoin and blockchain. Blockchain records transactions and other data on a shared ledger that allows participants to agree on the information's accuracy.

Analysts have said blockchain, as a result, has the potential to eliminate middlemen and remake everything from payments to ride-hailing to identifying theft and counterfeits. Bitcoin prices have sailed through peaks and valleys over the years, however, as hype built but failed to materialize.

JPMorgan Stock, Bitcoin Price

JPMorgan stock fell 1.9% to close at 99.33 in the stock market today. The stock was just above its 50-day line. Shares have a Composite Rating of 47 and an EPS Rating of 72.

Bitcoin rose 5% to $13,670 on Tuesday. The advance for the digital coin put it at levels not seen since early 2018.

Cryptocurrency prices jumped last week after PayPal (PYPL) announced the launch of a service that would allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrency from their PayPal accounts. That followed similar move from fintech rival Square (SQ) earlier.

""The migration toward digital payments and digital representations of value continues to accelerate, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased interest in digital currencies from central banks and consumers,"" PayPal said in a statement last week.

""Mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies has traditionally been hindered by their limited utility as an instrument of exchange due to volatility, cost and speed to transact,"" the statement continued.

Tackling Paper Checks, Central Banks

As part of the Onyx launch, JPMorgan has also changed the name of its blockchain-based Interbank Information Network to Liink. The Interbank Information Network, intended to speed up global payments, launched as a pilot in 2017. The network consists of more than 400 banks and corporations worldwide.

The bank also hopes blockchain could facilitate paper-check processing. JPMorgan is also looking into creating payment rails for central banks looking into creating their own digital currencies, CNBC said.

The bank, while more receptive to blockchain, was not always so receptive to cryptocurrency. CEO Jamie Dimon in 2017 called Bitcoin a ""fraud.""

According to data published Oct. 27 by independent crypto researcher Kevin Rooke, MicroStrategy has earned more from its Bitcoin (BTC) investment than it did through its actual business for the last three years, from Q1 2017 to Q2 2020.

Rooke’s data shows that the business intelligence firm’s 38,250 BTC holdings — worth roughly $425 million at the time of purchase in August and September — were valued at more than $525 million during the recent price surge to $13,745. According to the researcher, Microstrategy only earned $78 million in net income from its business operations in the last three and a half years.

“Our recent decision to make Bitcoin our primary treasury reserve asset is the latest example of MicroStrategy’s embrace of virtual technologies,” said CEO Michael Saylor regarding the firm’s most recent quarterly report. “The purchase of $425 million of Bitcoin during the quarter offers the possibility of greater return potential for investors than holding such balances in cash and has increased the overall visibility of MicroStrategy in the market.”

MicroStrategy initially purchased 21,454 BTC in August for $250 million, adopting the cryptocurrency as its primary reserve asset. Following the initial investment, the firm bought an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million. Though the company added digital assets to its quarterly financial report for the first time in Q3 2020, it also reported a $14.2 million net loss in income from its business operations. MicroStrategy stated in the future, it would purchase or sell more BTC depending on the Treasury Reserve Policy.

Initially claiming “Bitcoin’s days are numbered” in 2013, Saylor has since turned bullish on the cryptocurrency. In the weeks since MicroStrategy's initial $425 million investment, he has seemingly embraced a Bitcoin maximalist mindset by calling BTC one of the few “crypto-asset networks.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/india-will-soon-have-crypto-banking-at-22-physical-locations,"India’s digital assets space continues to see rapid development, with the latest news from the subcontinent being cryptocurrency financial services offered at physical branches.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

The cryptocurrency sector went into a tailspin last week as news reports finally confirmed long-running rumors that PayPal would start to support digital assets. According to a press release on the company’s website, PayPal users will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies — namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash — within their PayPal accounts.

The news comes thanks to a partnership with regulated crypto firm Paxos Trust Company. PayPal also confirmed it had been awarded a first-of-its-kind conditional Bitlicense by the State of New York. Although the service will only be available to U.S. users for now, it seems inevitable that PayPal will seek to roll out to more countries in time.

Aside from giving PayPal users the ability to buy and sell crypto, the company’s announcement came with even bigger news. The utility of cryptocurrencies will gain a major boost next year when PayPal makes cryptocurrencies available as a funding source for purchases. More than 26 million merchants worldwide accept PayPal, and the crypto integration requires no change on their part, as the company will settle all transactions in the merchant’s chosen fiat currency.

For the cryptocurrency sector, PayPal’s announcement is huge in terms of making digital assets available to a more mainstream audience of potential new adopters. According to one analyst on Twitter, there are around 187 million Bitcoin users, compared to PayPal’s global user base of 487 million. The news sent both the price of Bitcoin and PayPal’s share price skyrocketing. Bitcoin was trading up by more than $1,000 to a new yearly high of $13,000 last Wednesday, while PayPal stocks climbed around 5 percent to $211.

The First of Many Developments?

While PayPal’s press release doesn’t give much else away, there are heavy hints that we can expect more to come from the payment giant. It states that it’s been “exploring the potential for digital currencies through partnerships with licensed and regulated cryptocurrency platforms and with central banks around the world.”

Within a day of the initial news emerging, Bloomberg reported that PayPal was considering acquiring crypto custodian BitGo. Such an acquisition would mean that the company could handle custody of digital assets directly, rather than having to partner with external entities.

Those within the cryptocurrency community are speculating even more far-reaching developments. In an interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at digital asset manager Coinshares, mused about whether or not PayPal was considering launching its own token. Considering its high-profile departure from the Libra Association last year, it doesn’t seem to be impossible.

However, Jason Sibley, CRO at blockchain-based social media platform Hyprr, has a different take on it. “From its inception, PayPal’s founders had the idea of creating a new global online currency beyond the manipulation and control of governments,"" he explained in a recent interview with Entrepreneur. ""Arguably, cryptocurrencies have emerged in the space to fulfill the original PayPal vision, and now with PayPal announcing that it will offer cryptocurrency services to its userbase, it has come full circle.”

A Case for Stablecoins

If PayPal were to launch its own currency, it seems most likely it would be some kind of stablecoin, of the kind planned by Libra. Another option would be for the company to integrate one or more of the existing range of stablecoins. The biggest one by market cap, Tether (USDT,) is currently locked in a legal battle with the New York State Attorney General over alleged fraud, making it a likely no-go for PayPal. However, thanks to the explosion in popularity of decentralized finance, other stable tokens are gaining in popularity.

PayPal already has a partnership with Paxos Trust, which has its own USD-backed stablecoin regulated in the state of New York. Kava, which issues stablecoin USDX, is run by regulated financial institutions and banks that operate nodes on the network. Kava’s CEO Brian Kerr has already spied the opportunity, making an offer via Twitter to integrate USDX into PayPal’s crypto service.

Which way PayPal goes next remains to be seen. However, the payment giant seems intent on bringing cryptocurrency to the mainstream, representing what could prove to be a tipping point for widespread adoption.",2020-10-28 13:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/trump-campaign-website-compromised-by-hackers-for-crypto-giveaway-scam,"Disclosure

Coinbase claims it’s “the easiest, quickest way to spend your crypto worldwide.” Previously, the card was only available in Europe.

There are a number of debit cards around the world that allow you to spend cryptocurrency (you’ll soon be able to do so with Paypal as well). But many platforms require you to load funds onto the card in order to spend them. The Coinbase Card eliminates the middleman, instead pulling funds directly from your Coinbase account. Other cards are limited to one or a few currencies; the Coinbase Card supports more than 30, according to the company (and converts everything to US dollars before completing purchases and ATM withdrawals).

There’s an optional rewards program as well (only available to US customers for now). You can choose to earn 4 percent back in Stellar Lumen or 1 percent back in bitcoin. There’s no issuance fee, but Coinbase says that “cryptocurrency conversion fees may apply” (and those can be steep).

In Coinbase’s app, you’ll be able to keep track of recent transactions and rewards earnings. You can manage your rewards currency there, as well as the currency you’re spending with.

If this sounds like something you’re interested in, you can join the waitlist via the Coinbase app. It’ll be a bit of a wait — Coinbase says the first customers will be approved “this winter.” As soon as you’re approved, you’ll be able to start spending with a virtual card. You’ll get your physical card in the mail “within two weeks.” You, of course, need to have a verified Coinbase account in order to use the card.

JPMorgan has launched Onyx, a new business division for its blockchain projects, after its digital token was adopted for commercial use by a big technology client for the first time this week, CNBC reported.

A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the report.

JPM Coin is now being used for round-the-clock global payments by a ""large technology client,"" the bank's global head of wholesale payments told CNBC. The client was not named.

""We are launching Onyx because we believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,"" Takis Georgakopoulos said in a CNBC interview.

JPMorgan has launched a new business division dedicated to blockchain technology, called Onyx, after the bank's own digital currency was adopted for commercial use this week, CNBC reported on Tuesday.

A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the report to Business Insider.

JPM Coin, which was created last year, has been picked up for round-the-clock global payments by a ""large technology client"" this week, Takis Georgakopoulos, the bank's global head of wholesale payments, told CNBC in a phone interview.

He did not name the client, but said others are being onboarded too.

That headway and other under-the-radar progress induced the launch of Onyx, which is aimed at capturing the major shift towards digital currencies in the financial services industry.

""We are launching Onyx, because we believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,"" Georgakopoulos told CNBC.

Onyx is staffed with over 100 employees.

The development could be a push in favor of other blockchain and crypto-based industries that have been advocating for the end of traditional currencies.

Last week was a bullish one for digital currencies, as US payments firm PayPal announced it would allow use of Bitcoin on its network, investor Paul Tudor Jones called it the ""best inflation trade,"" and JPMorgan published positive research on the cryptocurrency.

The price of Bitcoin has soared by almost 25% this month to its highest since early 2018 and is now closing in on $14,000.

Tyler Winkelvoss, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, has even said the US dollar is ""no longer a store of value"" and has long recommended buying Bitcoin.

JPMorgan plans to focus on building a more inclusive system in the wholesale payments world to reimagine efficient ways of exchange and value, Georgakopoulos said.

Traditional financial-media outlets like Bloomberg News were writing about it.

Prices appeared to hit resistance just below $13,900, close to last year’s high. But analysts said that if the level is breached, there appear to be few brake points before the 11-year-old cryptocurrency ascends to $14,000 or beyond.

“Between the levels of $14,000 and $20,000, there is insufficient price data to single out any specific points of resistance,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in a newsletter.

In traditional markets, European stocks dropped to a five-month low and U.S. equity futures were declining, amid investor concerns about rising coronavirus case loads. Gold weakened 0.4% to $1,900 an ounce.

Market moves

Bitcoin‘s recent rally as U.S. stocks floundered has simply widened the cryptocurrency’s outperformance compared with traditional markets. As more investors tune in, the expanding gap could become a self-reinforcing trend.

Following Tuesday’s price surge to a new 2020 high around $13,700, bitcoin is now up 90% for the year to date. That puts the cryptocurrency well on pace to exceed last year’s 94% gain.

It’s also far ahead of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, where a recent slide has trimmed the year-to-date gains to just 5%, after a 27% rise in 2019.

Many big institutional investors, such as pension funds, are under pressure to hit annual return targets of 7%, and with stocks now faltering and bond yields close to historic lows, they’re casting about for alternatives. Bitcoin’s track record alone might be enough of a sell, but the 11-year-old cryptocurrency also represents what could be the beachhead of a brand new, state-of-the-art financial system – the digital rails, as the crypto-market ecosystem is described by some industry executives.

Then there’s the theory among many investors that bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a useful hedge against central-bank money printing – yet another compelling narrative at a time when top authorities from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund say massive stimulus is needed to keep the global economy from faltering. As highlighted in this column earlier this week, even analysts for the once-naysaying JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, are now opening discussing bitcoin’s potential upside.

“Every major institution is re-looking at it right now,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused money management firm Bitwise, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “There’s lots of pings in my LinkedIn inbox.” The San Francisco-based firm announced Wednesday that its assets under management recently crossed above $100 million for the first time.

According to Hougan, there are a few key differences now from prior bull runs in bitcoin, such as in 2017 when the cryptocurrency’s price shot to up to about $20,000.

There’s been a rapid explosion in the industry’s support infrastructure, from the development of regulated asset custodians to more reliable pricing feeds and more recently U.S. officials’ move to explicitly authorize banks to provide services to cryptocurrency companies. Last week’s move by PayPal to let users buy bitcoin offers a new seal of approval from an established company along with an incentive for other big financial firms to follow suit, in order to avoid getting left behind.

Notably, Bitwise has repeatedly failed in its years-long efforts to win approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. But Hougan said his firm has found a growing and welcoming cadre of financial advisors looking to steer money into its cryptocurrency investment funds, since they’re among the few assets having any major positive impact in 2020 on clients’ portfolios.

“We’re reaping the harvest of two years of building infrastructure in this space,” Hougan said. “It’s no surprise that we’re hitting multiyear highs.”

Digital-asset traders are so familiar with bitcoin’s infamous price swings that such bullishness can sometimes sound fawning, breathless, credulous. But right now it’s not just crypto money managers selling the story; bitcoin is getting a shot of credibility from its own market performance.

Bitcoin has decoupled from stocks this week. Prices narrowly missed the June 20019 high of $13,880 early Wednesday and were last seen at $13,550.

The minor pullback could be attributed to the overbought conditions signaled by the above-70 reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). The 14-week RSI has also crossed above 70.

An overbought reading does not imply a bearish reversal. That said, it often yields a temporary consolidation or pullback similar to the one seen in May and July.

Dips, however, could end up recharging bulls’ engine for a stronger rally, as fundamental indicators such as market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score, which measures market value’s deviation from realized value to assess undervalued and overvalued conditions. Right now the indicator suggests that bitcoin is far from overvalued and has plenty of room to extend the sharp rally from $3,867 to $13,800 seen over the past 7.5 months.

The MVRV Z-score, currently at 2.12, is hovering at two-year highs, according to data source Glassnode. That’s still well below the 7.0 score at which an asset is considered near a top.

All things considered, the path of least resistance for bitcoin remains to the higher side and bigger gains look likely albeit after minor consolidation.

An Indian bank is preparing to start providing crypto banking services at its physical bank branches. Customers can buy bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies at these branches with Indian rupees, open savings accounts with crypto wallets, make loans against their cryptocurrencies, and more.

Crypto Banking at Physical Bank Branches in India

Cryptocurrency users in India will soon be able to visit physical bank branches for crypto banking services as well as learn about cryptocurrency investing. This is due to a partnership, announced Monday, between crypto banking platform Cashaa and The United Multistate Credit Co. Operative Society (United), as part of Cashaa’s expansion plan in India. The United is a member of the National Federation of Urban Co-operative Banks and Credit Societies Ltd.

Dinesh Kukreja, Managing Director of United Multistate Credit Co. Operative Society, will be the CEO of the joint venture between the two companies. The announcement details:

The joint venture, Unicas, will build the world’s first crypto-friendly financial institution with physical branches and operations.

“Unicas will enable people to access traditional banking services along with crypto banking services both online and through its 22 physical branches across north India,” the announcement adds. Customers will be able to buy cryptocurrencies with cash at these physical branches, “Open saving accounts with crypto wallets … Loan against cryptocurrencies, gold, and real estate … [and] Invest in cryptocurrencies, bonds, and fixed deposits.”

A spokesperson for Cashaa confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com that “Currently, there are 22 active branches and the Unicas operations will start in December … we will be ready with 22 branches.” The companies had planned to launch crypto banking services at 34 branches. However, he explained that “Due to the covid situation opening up the remaining is a bit challenging … We are seeing a slow opening from the lockdown.”

Cashaa detailed: “Initially account holders will be able to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC), cashaa (CAS), ethereum (ETH), binance (BNB), bitcoin cash (BCH), EOS, litecoin (LTC) and ripple (XRP) in cash or with the account balance in Indian rupees.”

Crypto Lounges at Indian Bank Branches

“The United’s existing branches will be transformed and modernized as Crypto Lounges,” Cashaa described, noting that “Members can walk into any of these branches and get educated about cryptocurrencies along with other banking services.”

The spokesperson further shared with news.Bitcoin.com: “We will educate them on investment opportunities, utilities of bitcoin and other cryptos, how to use and store crypto, etc.” He clarified that non-bank customers “will have access to general material, but the usage of lounges are for bank customers.” Cashaa emphasized:

The immediate plan is to open these Crypto Lounges in Delhi, Gujarat, and Rajasthan covering a population of 150 million Indians living in these states.

Kukreja commented: “By increasing our exposure to emerging technologies, we are aiming to rapidly expand to over 100 physical branches by 2021, employing thousands of skilled professionals in India,” noting:

Our savings bank account holders will also be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collaterals to take loans, like any other traditional loan given by banks.

A while back, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm Coinbase launched the Coinbase Visa debit card for European customers. Coinbase disclosed that the card is now being leveraged in 30 different countries within the UK and Europe.

On Wednesday, the company announced that American residents can now register for the crypto card.

“Starting today, customers in the U.S. can join the waitlist for Coinbase Card, a Visa debit card that allows crypto to be used for payments and purchases online and in-store as well as for ATM cash withdrawals,” the company announced. The announcement explains that the Coinbase card will allow people to spend with nine different cryptocurrencies.

Similarly to competitor cards from firms like Crypto.com, U.S. card users will be able to obtain purchase rewards from Coinbase. “At launch, customers can opt to earn 4% back in stellar lumens (XLM) or 1% back in bitcoin (BTC),” the San Francisco tech firm detailed. American Coinbase card applicants must be fully verified on the system and there will be a wait time until the firm makes its first approvals.

“The first customers will be approved this winter,” Coinbase disclosed. “Once customers are approved, they can spend with a virtual card right away and will receive a physical card in the mail within two weeks.”

Coinbase notes that there is no fee required in order to issue the card, but standard crypto conversion fees may apply. Much like the Crypto.com Visa or the Bitpay Mastercard, the Coinbase card will also provide a virtual card. The firm detailed during the announcement that users can utilize the virtual Coinbase Visa as soon as they are approved.

The company also details that the card is powered by Marqeta, and issued by the FDIC member Metabank. “Coinbase will automatically convert all cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars for use in purchases and ATM withdrawals,” the company announcement concludes.

According to the firm, U.S. residents from all the states are eligible except for residents from Hawaii.

Iran has reportedly revised the country’s cryptocurrency regulation to require licensed bitcoin miners to sell their coins directly to the central bank for use to fund imports.

Iran’s Revised Crypto Law

The Iranian government has amended its cryptocurrency regulation to enable the country’s central bank to fund imports with bitcoin legally mined in the country, the government-controlled IRNA news agency reported on Saturday. Iranian publication Financial Tribune conveyed:

The measure proposed by the Central Bank of Iran [CBI] and the Ministry of Energy requires licensed cryptominers to sell the coins they mine directly to the CBI.

“The Ministry of Energy is tasked with defining a ceiling for output of authorized crypto units subject to the energy consumed by each unit. Miners’ output should not exceed the ceiling,” the publication added, noting that the central bank will soon announce details of the new law.

Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, deputy head of Iran’s Power Generation, Distribution, and Transmission Company (Tavanir) and the spokesperson for the power industry, confirmed that “These cryptocurrencies can be exchanged according to the regulations set by the central bank,” Mehr news agency quoted him as saying.

Presstv, an Iranian state-owned news and documentary network affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), explained: “The miners are supposed to supply the original cryptocurrency directly and within the authorized limit to the channels introduced by the CBI … The legal cap for the amount of cryptocurrency for each miner would be determined by the level of the subsidized energy used for mining and based on instructions published by the Ministry of the Energy.”

Cryptocurrency analyst Alireza Shamkhi told ISNA news agency that the new law is vague and ambiguous. For example, it does not state how the central bank will price cryptocurrencies or the exchange rate between dollars and rials. Previously, miners could exchange their cryptocurrencies for dollars, rials, or other currencies at market prices. He added that the requirement for miners to report their output to the central bank is not seen in other industries, concluding that the new law will likely reduce the industry’s attractiveness and significantly lower miners’ profit margin.

Iran has issued over 1,000 licenses to crypto miners, including one to the Turkish bitcoin mining giant Iminer. Power plants in Iran are allowed to mine cryptocurrencies and bitcoin miners have been granted exclusive access to electricity generated from three of them. Meanwhile, over a thousand illegal bitcoin miners have been shut down.

Key Takeaways Monero miners are earning more fees than Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash counterparts.

Privacy ranks high among developers and users for payment-focused cryptocurrencies.

The privacy-centric cryptocurrency, Monero, is now outpacing leading altcoins as the industry turns a new eye to personal privacy.

Monero Enters Mainstream Crypto Payments

The total fees on Monero have surpassed that of Bitcoin Cash in April and Litecoin towards the end of September this year. Moreover, the transaction costs for the next popular privacy-based cryptocurrency Zcash is less than 5% of XMR.

This is an indicator of XMR’s healthy network usage compared to BCH and LTC. Justin Ehrenhofer, a community lead for the Monero project, told Crypto Briefing:

“There seems to be a perfect storm going on where liquidity is up, supporting more payments than were previously reasonable, which thus are driving more liquidity. It’s a positive feedback loop from more payments moving to Monero with its greater liquidity as far as I can tell.”

There has also been a consistent rise in average fees for transactions on Monero since July this year. This metric is roughly five to eight times the average transaction fee on Litecoin.

The transaction privacy on Monero prevents comparing transaction count and volume on these protocols.

The increase in the average fee on Monero, however, suggests that the actual volume of transactions on Litecoin is greater. This is because, while the XMR’s total earning from fees is 1.33 times of LTC, the mean transaction fee is five to eight times more.

The fees on Monero are higher than Litecoin, however. It costs roughly $0.007 to make an LTC transaction, and $0.05 to make an XMR transaction. Users needn’t worry about any exorbitant costs when making XMR payments relative to LTC. The rise in earnings via fees helps grow the mining ecosystem, strengthening the network’s security and liquidity.

Privacy Tops The List

Monero, famed for its use on the dark web, has been neglected mainly due to regulatory concerns.

However, the recent push towards privacy from Bitcoin and Litecoin developers is accentuating mainstream usage of Monero. Litecoin, for instance, has already announced its privacy upgrade Mimblewimble in 2021. Ehrenhofer added:

“There is also another dynamic where the cryptocurrency community more and more trusts and recommends Monero for private payments.”

Along with on-chain progress on Monero, other privacy-based tokens like Zcash and Dash have performed better in terms of price compared with Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

Still, Monero leads the year-to-date price gains with a 175% increase compared to 100% on Zcash and 65% on DASH. The same metric only gives Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash a 35% increase.

Based on this data, the market ultimately appears to be valuing privacy-based coins greater than traceable counterparts.

The move aims to resolve tax dilemma since it produces a variety of tax filing formats that the IRS often requires.

Gemini will use TaxBit’s Tax Center Suite to automate tax forms and filings, which helps reduce potential human errors and ensure automatic regulatory updates. The company’s Tax Information reporting solution allows Gemini to protect its users just as investors of other asset classes.

“TaxBit’s software automates the calculations required for crypto tax reporting, helping reduce the pain point of crypto tax for our users. Investors will also be able to see real-time tax implications of any trades they make on Gemini, ” said Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini.

TaxBit provides customers with a tax liability dashboard, which gives them better visibility into the tax impact of their crypto transactions. Additionally, it helps file more accurate tax returns, monitors their tax liability and highlights potential tax refunds. Customers can see the real-time tax impact of their transactions, as well as receive trade alerts when tax saving opportunities are available.

US Regulator Gets Tough on Crypto Taxes

This collaboration with Taxbit, which is backed by Gemini founders, the Winklevoss twins, should address the reporting needs of the cryptocurrency customers in the upcoming tax season. As such, accounting professionals servicing crypto-transacting clients will have sources required when reconciling cryptocurrency balances and transactions.

Recently, there have been numerous reports emerging of tax authorities clamping down and going after cryptocurrency traders. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also sent letters to taxpayers who might have failed to report income and pay the resulting tax from cryptocurrency transactions.

At the very core, the IRS still deems crypto assets to be property rather than currency for income tax purposes, the same as its regulatory guidance came out five years ago. That means the authority will continue to tax crypto profits and losses like those for stocks, at capital gains rates.

TaxBit CEO, Austin Woodward also commented, “We are excited to partner with Gemini in order to bring industry leading tax technology to Gemini’s platform. Gemini is making crypto taxes, something that historically has been viewed as intimidating and complex, simple.”",2020-10-29 16:51:38+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/10/29/crypto-whales-are-quietly-accumulating-these-six-crypto-assets-amid-bitcoin-breakout/,"High net worth crypto investors are quietly pouring money into six crypto assets amid Bitcoin’s recent price surge.

All six assets are built on Ethereum, and the amount of each held by the top non-exchange whale addresses have hit one-year highs in the past week, according to the analytics firm Santiment.

“With most eyes on Bitcoin’s market price between this $12,700 and $13,300 range, whales of many respective ETH-based altcoins have added to their non-exchange bags. ETH, LINK, REN, ELF, KNC, and ZRX are among those recently hitting one-year highs.”

Ethereum is trading at $389.81 at time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. That’s down from a 2020 high of $487.21, which ETH reached in August right as decentralized finance (DeFi) projects were exploding.

Santiment says the second-biggest crypto is currently displaying bullish and bearish metrics simultaneously.

“There is good news and bad news for Ethereum’s quest to again surpass the $420 price barrier.

The good news is that miners aren’t selling, and there is a big increase in new ETH addresses being created, and pre-existing addresses have shown an increase in activity. The bad news is that social sentiment is bordering on euphoric territory, and daily active deposits have jumped in a big way.”

The other five popular altcoins amongst whales have also failed to reach new highs in the past week and have seen varied price action over the past seven days.

LINK is up 7% on the week, REN is down 14%, ELF is down 0.4%, Kyber is down 7.4% and ZRX is down 9.4%.

However, a closer look at the conditions and permissions made some wonder if there was any point. Is there?

PayPal introduced its “Crypto Currencies Hub” to U.S. residents (excluding Hawaii) in October 2020. It allows users with a Personal Account and Cash Account to maintain a balance in BTC and/or selected other digital assets via a third-party provider, which for most at this stage is Paxos Trust Company LLC.

The company’s detailed Terms and Conditions page for the Crypto Currencies Hub lists what you can do with these digital assets:

– Buy Crypto Assets;

– Hold Crypto Assets;

– Sell Crypto Assets; and

– View market information and educational content.

This list is notable for what you can’t do. The terms also explicitly state:

You currently are NOT able to send Crypto Assets to family or friends, use Crypto Assets to pay for goods or services, or withdraw Crypto Assets from your Cryptocurrencies Hub to an external cryptocurrency wallet. If you want to withdraw the value from your Cryptocurrencies Hub you will need to sell your Crypto Assets and withdraw the cash proceeds from their sale.

In other words, you can buy/sell “crypto assets” only as an investment—the Terms does say “currently,” which could mean there are plans to expand the functionality, but there’s no timeframe or guarantee that will happen. You’re also prevented from shopping around exchanges for the best price, since you can only buy/sell through PayPal’s official broker.

PayPal’s Terms state that users do actually “own” the digital assets in their balance, but do not own specific units of each asset. It holds all its digital funds in an “omnibus account” rather than individual wallets/addresses for each user. This is presumably to prevent users attempting to claiming assets resulting from a chain split or fork.

Some wondered if it’s possible to audit PayPal’s wallets to see if the digital assets in your balance even exists—or even if it might lead to companies holding fractional reserves:

The PayPal thing is an abomination! You cannot use the cryptocurrency at all… It is merely, an investment tool. There produce and offer zero utility to the underlying asset. You can't even send it anywhere or pay with it… I thought I'd seen it all, but this takes the cake! https://t.co/h8EWHbbgDW — Eli Afram (@justicemate) October 28, 2020

A couple of things to mention: if I hold a PayPal balance in a foreign currency, it’s also virtually impossible for me to withdraw that, unless I have a real bank account in that unit. I can’t withdraw 100 Swiss francs and receive physical cash, for instance, so it’s a similar deal. On the other hand, I could actually pay another person in Swiss francs with my balance, so it’s still more useful than PayPal BTC.

Also, the BTC (and other digital asset) community has done little over the years to promote blockchain assets as much more than speculative investment vehicles, something to “HODL” until the next big bull run, when you can sell it for fiat and buy that Lambo. BTC in particular gives lip service to payment utility, but cripples the protocol to make it infeasible on a mass scale.

Other terms, like the ability to freeze/seize your balance or prevent you from trading if they suspect you of violating terms, are standard PayPal fare and also apply to fiat currency balances, or the ability to keep a PayPal account at all.

The idea (or fear) of custodial wallets, exchanges and payment providers maintaining only fractional reserves in digital assets is not new either. Unless a service provides regular, trustworthy audits of their reserves or allows users access to individual addresses, this is always a possibility.

Perhaps PayPal’s limited options are more a reflection of how people view digital assets. For some, they’re an alternative form of money, but the mainstream majority still sees them as investments only—mainly because few actually accept them as a payment method. PayPal, as always, is doing what it can within the limits current regulations allow.

PayPal expanding into other payment options

PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has said his goal is 1 billion users transacting on PayPal every day. To that end, the company has been branching out into a greater variety of payment methods in recent times. It has promoted in-store payments by adding QR code capabilities to the PayPal and Venmo apps, and partnered with CVS Health to integrate QR codes into their own point-of-sale systems. PayPal is also exploring other contactless payment methods with (non-blockchain) tokenized currencies other payment card companies use.

There’s also a new Venmo credit card and PayPal is expanding its business debit card service to more countries. Its new “Pay in 4” option for merchants allows consumers to make a payment up-front and then pay it off in four (interest-free) instalments.

PayPal could well extend the functionality of its Cryptocurrency Hub in the future, and if it meant hitting that 1 billion transactions a day mark, it would probably be happy to. But for now, buying/holding/selling digital assets is all the mainstream wants.

Do we really need Bitcoin on PayPal?

In a world that runs on the Bitcoin blockchain (that means BSV, since the world can’t run on the BTC blockchain) with myriad tokenized assets, PayPal wouldn’t even be necessary. There would be many multi-asset services that could swap instantly, just as wallets often have that functionality built in today.

It’s ironic that BTC fans celebrate recognition and “support” by popular financial services (and complaining about their limitations), while at the same time promoting their own asset network as an alternative to them that skirts around their regulations. The more Bitcoin (BSV), BTC, ETH or other digital assets become seen as “real money,” the more they will be subject to the same regulations. Only BSV is set up for the regulated world that we live in.

A crypto hedge fund index launched in September 2018 by crypto fund of funds Vision Hill Group showed a return of 126% in 2020.

Non-crypto hedge fund sectors tracked by another data group, BarclayHedge, were also in positive territory, but up a modest 1.70% through September.

The emergence of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which are crypto platforms that facilitate lending outside of traditional banking institutions, was at the core of crypto funds’ robust performance this year, said Scott Army, founder and chief executive officer of Vision Hill, which has exposure in DeFi as well.

The total number of loans on DeFi platforms was $11.1 billion on Thursday, industry site DeFi Pulse data showed, up 180% from roughly $4 billion in August. DeFi sites run on open infrastructure, with algorithms that set rates in real-time based on supply and demand.

Framework Ventures, a $100-million venture capital fund and the biggest investor in the DeFi space, believes DeFi will soon have its mainstream moment.

“Users are trying to vote with their dollars in terms of how they view the capabilities of DeFi,” said Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures, noting that some DeFi platforms have more volume than the much larger digital asset exchanges.

Meanwhile, bitcoin’s more than 80% increase this year also helped propel hedge funds, as it drove rallies in the crypto market.

Off the Chain Capital posted returns of 94% so far in 2020 and average annual returns of 112% since its inception in 2016, purchasing at a discount bitcoin claims from those impacted by the Mt. Gox hack in 2014, said Brian Estes, the firm’s chief investment officer and managing partner.

That hack saw 24,000 customers lose access to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.

Terry Culver, chief executive officer at Digital Finance Group USA, said the crypto space has matured, with a lot more innovation in the industry.

“Giving trick-or-treaters Open Dimes and Square Crypto grants this year. Speaking of which, this one goes to Maggie Valentine, a designer working to simplify wallet onboarding flows by reducing technical jargon and increasing user education,” the company said via Twitter.

Square Crypto supports the development of the Bitcoin network by giving grants to developers and companies working in the crypto space.

The company wants to give its latest grant to Valentine so she can design a wallet that is easy-to-use for crypto newbies.

According to Valentine’s thesis, people are not using Bitcoin or Bitcoin wallets because they’re too complicated. One thing that puts users off, she says, is the “technical jargon, unfamiliar user concepts”—plus potential users have had “little-to-no education.”

She said: “Unless equipped with a technical background, users are often deterred from reaping the benefits this technology has to offer. To preserve the ethos of this space—an ethos built upon fixing the otherwise broken current financial system—it’s crucial to use design as a vehicle to create better experiences for all types of users.”

Valentine hopes to improve this by looking at how a selection of wallets “present private keys/seed phrases to users by looking at specific copy and onboarding flows.” She will then work to “understand which option might be the ‘best’ for non-crypto-savvy folks”—and design a new wallet.

Square added in its announcement that “difficult wallet UX shouldn't determine who benefits from Bitcoin.”

According to an investigation by the Metro newspaper published Tuesday, a number of investors said they had invested in a cryptocurrency project called Lyfcoin on promises of hefty returns, but had not received their money back.

According to the allegations, investors were told to make staking commitments for five months to receive a 100% return, but as the period was ending they were told they’d have to extend to 12 or 24 months. Staking is a way of supporting some blockchain networks and earning rewards by committing funds for a period of time.

While it’s not alleged by the newspaper that Lyfcoin itself is a fraudulent scheme – though investors likened it to the multi-billion dollar OneCoin scam – investors who spoke to Metro.co.uk said they had been encouraged to invest by individuals claiming to be involved with the project.

The group says it lost around £100,000 (US$130,000) in investing in the coin and estimates that up to £2.5 million ($3 million) could have been lost in the U.K. in total.

They claim an individual named Sakhi Rezaie recruited people for the alleged pyramid scheme, showing presentations, holding Zoom seminars and inviting potential investors to his Birmingham office. Payments to stake the token were sent to Rezaie’s bank accounts and not to an official Lyfcoin account, they said.

Rezaie has claimed he was merely an investor in the crypto project, Metro said. However, the newspaper was shown WhatsApp chats and proof of payments to his account in the name of M.K. Brothers Ltd by an investor who lost £36,500 to the scheme.

The investors further allege there were several “ringleaders” in the U.K.

After payments were made, Rezaie “ignored” queries from investors about selling their stakes, they claim.

The lyfcoin token had been touted as having a value of $1.60, but investors say they later found that it is not traded on most exchanges and in effect had a value of “zero.” They were not provided with a wallet or tokens, they said.

One investor made a report to U.K. reporting organization Action Fraud, which Metro said passed it on to the West Midlands Police. This spring, he signed a contract – seen by the Metro – with Rezaie promising to drop the case and apologize on social media in return for monthly payments of roughly £5,000 ($6,470). He claims to have received only one payment.

The investor said he managed to claw back £18,500 of the £36,000 he put in after warning members of a Lyfcoin WhatsApp group about the alleged fraud.",2020-10-30 09:30:26+00:00,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/30/2117954/0/en/Coin-Founder-Damon-Nam-Is-Disrupting-Finance-and-the-Blockchain-Industry-with-his-Venture-Coin.html,"Los Angeles, CA, Oct. 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (via Blockchain Wire) If you’ve been looking into the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Decentralized Finance (DeFI) movement for more than five minutes, you’ve probably run into the name Damon Nam. Damon is a 20 year IT professional, Microsoft alumnus, entrepreneur, and currently the Founder and CEO of Coin; an emerging financial services and technology company.

During his 17-year tenure at Microsoft, he assumed a number of different roles within the Microsoft Services organization. In his last role at Microsoft as a US Services Program Director, he was responsible for driving and managing Microsoft’s entire partner program for the US subsidiary; a program with approximately seventy-five partner organizations and a total book of business of over $90 million in revenue. With a great deal of business and information technology services experience under his belt, Damon, who has had years of interest in blockchain technology, decided it was time to put his particular talents to the task of tackling the problems in the traditional financial services industry. To that end, he founded Coin, a US-based FinTech startup.

Today’s financial solutions, centralized banking entities, and devaluing dollars from continuous money printing by governments across the world, have sparked a renewed interest in sovereign wealth management for consumers. This has resulted in a large demand for an open financial system driven by blockchain technology and alternative assets such as Bitcoin. While innovative, the complex nature of today’s solutions in the blockchain industry has created a dynamic that eliminates a large percentage of the population that seeks to join the revolution. Damon and his team at Coin want to completely democratize this industry and bring it to the masses by creating a paradigm shift that makes wealth management for digital assets seamless, simple, affordable, and accessible. Thereby, also reducing the wealth gaps that exist in our society and creating equal opportunity and a level playing field across the world. Damon’s goal is to develop solutions that reduce the complexities and pitfalls of the world’s traditional financial system and its inherent problems of high costs and risks that stem from corruption, human involvement, and custody of customer funds.



Coin XYZ, Inc. develops blockchain solutions to empower the world to execute secure financial transactions with freedom and simplicity. Coin is led by a team of Microsoft veterans including Byron Levels, and prominent advisors such as Christina Apatow, founder of FetchyFox, Jeremy Gardner, founder of Augur, Alex Mashinsky, founder of Celsius Network, as well as Pete Cashmore, founder of Mashable.

Coin is staying the course and creating this new reality for all of us. They have architected a decentralized network that contains products and services that work cohesively together to solve these problems and empower consumers to manage their wealth. So what’s the platform that is going to disrupt the financial and blockchain industries might you ask?



The Coin Exchange, an all-in-one cross-chain P2P decentralized cryptocurrency wallet, exchange, and assistant powered by atomic swap and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Coin Exchange includes an integrated cryptocurrency wallet for users to store popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. For exchanging assets, Coin Exchange leverages atomic swaps which replace the need for any third party involvement. This ensures low fees and is the most secure method of transferring value, as transactions occur directly between users, on the blockchain. This also makes Coin Exchange non-susceptible to hacks as users are the only custodians that can access their funds and no personal data is collected or centrally stored.



The Coin Exchange also includes browser extension support for the Internet’s most popular web browsers such as Google Chrome and Safari. When installed, this feature extends its capability by using AI technology to execute transactions faster and provide insights to help users save time and money. Similar to Grammarly’s grammar recognition, Coin Exchange includes an assistant that can recognize blockchain-related keywords from any webpage. This allows Coin to provide education, insights, or help consumers execute financial transactions directly from any webpage with an input field. For example, users can send, receive and exchange transactions in a guided process or simply by typing text commands such as “Send $50 Bitcoin to @cryptojane” in any input field on the Internet. What is currently considered a complex task, can now be completed in a matter of seconds while browsing the web.



Unlike other solutions in the financial/blockchain industry today, the Coin Exchange brings a fresh innovative user experience to an industry filled with complexity and confusion. For example, instead of requiring users to navigate and login to their banking website or app, Coin’s AI works behind-the-scenes and seamlessly merges personal finance into the natural workflows of our daily activities on the Internet including browsing the web, creating documents, and updating social media.



“By leveraging emerging technology, we are placing the power back into the hands of the people, and empowering consumers to manage their wealth with an innovative digital assets experience that is simple, secure, and personalized,” says Damon Nam, founder and CEO at Coin.



The Coin Exchange creates a seamless, unified experience while browsing the Internet to help bridge the gap and bring cryptocurrencies to the masses. The shift to sovereign wealth management has already begun… Damon and his all-star team at Coin aspire to become the industry-leading financial organization that leads the charge to disrupt the norm.

The theoretical concept of digital currencies has been examined long before the inception of Satoshi Nakamoto’s pioneering Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Early proponents of ‘crypto’ foresaw the benefits of applying revolutionary principles from the fields of computer science and mathematics to address the shortcomings of sovereign currencies.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts had been working for decades on earlier iterations of digital currencies, which paved the way for the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. Its meteoric rise in popularity meant Bitcoin became the first publicly used means of exchange, combining decentralised control with user anonymity and record-keeping via a blockchain.

More than 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence today and their exponential growth has accumulated more than 100 million unique users worldwide. However, as early as the 70s, several classical economists were already highlighting the flaws of traditional monetary policies and proposing the idea of a competitively driven medium of exchange.

The most prominent among them was F.A. Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist from Austria, who believed a state’s monopoly over the issuance of currency should be extended to private companies – in order to foster competition and give people the freedom to choose their own currencies.

A primary advocate of classical liberalism, Hayek believed it was markets, not states, that guaranteed individual liberty. For Hayek, liberty is “a policy which deliberately adopts competition, markets and prices as its ordering principles”. Furthering this idea in his polemic ‘The Road to Serfdom’, he argued Germany and the Soviet Union’s mistakes were in their state planning because it interfered in the natural operation of markets, disrupted liberty and set society down a one-way street towards slavery.

The modern libertarians today – from Steve Baker in the British Conservative Party to US Republican Senator Rand Paul – could argue crypto is the antithesis of state bureaucracy, by breaking its monopoly on the volume of money in circulation, as well as on credit and interest rates.

Hayek today would resent any ‘market’ environment where one apparatchik in Whitehall or state actor must decide an action each time, so much so they ultimately must be deferred to repeatedly over time. No one individual can make rational choices about economic problems without the information to base their decisions upon.

Anyone can now securely open a Bitcoin account from their mobile device, offering the potential to democratise monetary systems like never before. What is more, the market-driven price of cryptocurrencies aligns with Hayek’s vision where the free market acts as a constant referendum on the value of goods and services within an economy. In other words, the market represents a form of collective agreement, voluntarily made amongst all people operating in it.

Markets are extremely complex networks with millions of transactions going on all the time –precisely what cryptocurrencies have become.

The principles underpinning Bitcoin’s design also align with Hayek’s proposal of establishing a decentralised currency or “privately issued money” – explored in his revolutionary work ‘The Denationalisation of Money.’ For Hayek, established currency systems lead to social inequality as the government monopoly on them prevents the discovery of a better method of fulfilling the market’s needs.

In this, Hayek argues centralised economic planning is not the key to economic stability, rather market signals from independent actors. The lack of in-depth information available to a centrally regulated entity means regular boom and bust cycles of supply and demand are artificially created and are wrongly perceived to be relatively stable. Hayek’s theory advocates for a decentralised, “permissionless” network of nodes, much like those observed in the decentralised network of actors in a blockchain ledger.

Since there is no single point of failure or control of their underlying system, cryptocurrencies contain robust bulwarks against external manipulation, geopolitical influence or censorship. The collectively maintained Bitcoin ledger includes a snapshot of which transactions have been approved by the community, and consequently, provides an indication of how much Bitcoin is owned by each account (which in turn belongs to end-users). Users are prudently paid for keeping and maintaining this ledger through ‘mining blocks’.

Cryptocurrencies, therefore, represent the real-world implementation of Hayek’s thesis for monetary systems.

Despite their benefits, these technologies will continue to face resistance from governments before being more widely accepted. Primary among the criticisms of cryptocurrencies are their market volatility, issues of privacy and the interoperability of different types of currencies, all of which have hindered their adoption and all criticisms which Hayek himself would have shared.

Another issue with the widespread adoption of “privatised currency” is that the objectives of private issuers may conflict with providing an indispensable commodity like money – especially if they are only focused on maximising profits. In this case, a digital currency with central bank backing could be a credible alternative to deliver some of the benefits of cryptocurrencies to potential users.

The Governor of the Bank of England, however, is a sceptic. Andrew Bailey described the digital asset as a “volatile” and “odd commodity” and told Members of Parliament earlier this year: “If you want to buy Bitcoin, be prepared to lose all your money… [Bitcoin] has no intrinsic value.”

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has also said he’ll never own any cryptocurrency, acknowledging Bitcoin’s choice role for money launderers and terrorists to move money around.

All these factors and more have hindered the growth of cryptocurrencies. That said, it is undeniable they have the potential to enable a paradigm shift in the way our monetary systems operate.

Speaking about sound money in 1984 Hayek said presciently: “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.”

His predictions will be tested further in the future as cryptocurrencies continue their journey towards formal recognition and acceptance. For the moment, crypto is here to stay.

The Bitcoin price surge continued this week and it managed to increase by 4.5% to reach $13,60 at the time of this writing. The coin was trading slightly above $13,000 last Friday and moved sideways along this level over the weekend.

On Tuesday, Bitcoin started to surge higher as broke resistance at $13,415, climbed above $13,500, and reached the resistance at $13,815 (1.272 Fib Extension). The bulls could not close a daily candle above this resistance, which led to Bitcoin dropping as low as $13,000 on Wednesday.

Since then, Bitcoin has traded sideways in a wide range between $13,815 and $13,000.

Looking ahead, if the buyers push higher again, the first level of resistance lies at $13,500. Following this, resistance lies at $13,815, $14,000, $14,190, and $14,500 (1.618 Fib Extension).

On the other side, if the sellers push lower, the first level of strong support lies at $13,000 (.236 Fib Retracement). Added support then lies at $12,750, $12,500 (.382 FIb Retracement), $12,236 (downside 1.618 Fib Extension), $12,100 (.5 Fib), and $12,000.

Ethereum

Ethereum saw a sharp 8.3% price drop this week as it falls into the $380 support (.5 Fib Retracement). Last Friday, Ethereum struggled to break above the resistance at $416 – provided by a bearish .618 Fib Retracement. It rolled over from here and started to head lower during the week as it fell beneath $400.

Initially, Ethereum managed to find support at $389 (.382 Fib Retracement). However, the sellers broke past this support today as it plummeted into the $377 level (.5 Fib Retracement).

Moving forward, if the sellers break beneath $377, the first level of support lies at $364 (2019 High). Beneath this, support lies at $355 (100-days EMA), $350, and $342.

On the other side, if the buyers can rebound from $377, resistance lies at $390, $400, $410, and $416.

Against Bitcoin, Ethereum has struggled heavily this week as it hits as low as 0.0284 BTC(Feb 2020 Highs). The coin was trading above 0.031 BTC at the start of the week as it was trading at the 100-days EMA resistance. From there, ETH headed lower as it collapsed beneath both 0.031 BTC and 0.030 BTC in a couple of days.

The coin continued to plummet over the last few days as it dropped beneath the 200-days EMA and 0.029 BTC to reach the current support at 0.0284 BTC.

Looking ahead, if the selling continues to break 0.0284 BTC, support lies at 0.0281 BTC, 0.0278 BTC, and 0.027 BTC.

On the other side, resistance is first expected at 0.029 BTC. This is followed by resistance at the 200-days EMA, 0.03 BTC, and 0.0305 BTC.

Ripple

Ripple also saw quite a sharp 7.8% price fall this week as the coin drops beneath the 200-days EMA into the $0.237 level. Last Friday, XRP was trying to overcome resistance at a falling trend line but could not do so. As a result, the coin headed lower throughout the week and broke beneath the 100-days EMA yesterday.

Today, XRP continued lower to break beneath a rising trend line (the lower boundary of a triangle) to drop beneath the 200-days EMA and hit the current $0.237 support. XRP spiked as low as $0.23 today, but the buyers have since pushed the price higher.

Moving forward, if the selling continues beneath $0.237, support initially lies at $0.23. This is followed by support at $0.228 (.618 Fib), $0.22, and $0.217.

On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at $0.24. Added resistance lies at $0.245 (100-days EMA), $0.251 (bearish .382 Fib), and $0.261 (bearish .5 Fib).

XRP is currently in a terrible downward spiral against BTC and reached lows that have not been since December 2017 this week. It was trying to reclaim the resistance at 2000 SAT last Friday but failed to do so and proceeded to plummet over the weekend.

The price collapse continued throughout the week as XRP reached as low as 1755 SAT today. The buyers have since pushed it higher slightly to trade near 1780 SAT, but the situation is extremely bearish.

Looking ahead, it is likely that the selling will continue. If the sellers push beneath 1755 SAT, additional support is found at 1730 SAT, 1700 SAT, 1680 SAT, 1650 SAT, and 1600 SAT.

On the other side, resistance lies at 1800 SAT, 1865 SAT, and 1900 SAT.

Chainlink

LINK saw an 8.6% price fall over the past week as it approaches the lower boundary of an ascending price channel. The coin was trading at the upper boundary of this price channel at the start of the week but was unable to break above it. A bearish .5 Fib Retracement further bolsters the upper boundary at $12.75.

As a result, LINK rolled over and started to head lower throughout the week as it broke back beneath $11.50 to reach the current $10.95 level.

Looking ahead, if the bears push LINK lower, the first level of support lies at $10.50 – the lower boundary of the price channel. If the sellers break beneath the channel, support lies at $10, $9.80, $9.00, and $8.77.

On the other side, if the buyers can rebound at the lower boundary, resistance lies at $11.50, $12, and $12.75 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement).

Against Bitcoin, LINK has also been falling this week. It was trading near 100,000 SAT last Friday but started to head lower from here. It dropped beneath 90,000 SAT throughout the week and fell beneath a rising trend line yesterday to hit 80,777 SAT today.

Moving forward, if the sellers break beneath 80,777 SAT the first level of support lies at 80,000 SAT. Beneath this, support is found at 75,600 SAT (downside 1.414 Fib Extension), 70,000 SAT, 68,400 SAT, and 60,000 SAT (.786 Fib Retracement).

On the other side, resistance lies at 86,800 SAT. Above this, resistance is expected at 90,000 SAT, 94,300 SAT, and 100,000 SAT (bearish .382 Fib Retracement).

Binance Coin

BNB also suffered a 7.6% price fall this week as it drops into the $28.17 support (.382 Fib Retracement). BNB managed to climb above $32 on Tuesday, but the sellers quickly stepped in to push the coin lower.

Today, BNB fell sharply beneath $30 and continued to fall until support was found at $27.54 (downside 1.272 Fib Extension). It has rebounded from here and is now trading at $28.17 (.382 Fib).

Looking ahead, if the bulls can continue to rebound from the current support, the first level of resistance lies at $29.30. This is followed by resistance at $30, $30.72, $31.30, and $32.

On the other side, if the sellers push beneath $28.17, support lies at $27.55, $27 (.5 Fib), $26.34 (fownside 1.618 Fib Extension), and $25.84 (.618 Fib).

Against Bitcoin, BNB created a fresh October low today at the 0.00207 BTC level (downside 1.272 Fib Extension). The coin was trading at around 0.00236 BTC last Friday, and it pushed higher on Monday and Tuesday to reach as high as 0.00242 BTC. It was unable to break this resistance, which caused the coin to roll over and head lower.

Today, BNB dropped beneath the support at 0.0222 BTC (.618 Fib), and it dropped lower to reach the support at 0.00212 BTC – where it is currently trading.

Moving forward, if the sellers continue to push lower, the first level of support lies at 0.00206 BTC (downside 1.272 Fib Extension). Following this, support is found at 0.002 BTC (.786 Fib), 0.00194 BTC, and 0.0019 BTC.

Resistance is expected at 0.0022 BTC, 0.0023 BTC, and 0.00235 BTC.",2020-10-30 15:59:26+00:00

This is causing the alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market to pullback, which has seen rising selling pressure and low buyer demand.

On Oct. 30, researchers at Santiment pinpointed the growing volume and dominance of Bitcoin, while Chainlink (LINK), Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) struggled. They wrote:

“The dominance involving #Bitcoin is continuing to display itself, particularly via trading volume. When comparing other top blockchains in the past day, note the decline in $ETH, $XRP, $LINK, and $BNB trading volume, while BTC's levels stayed high.”

At least in the foreseeable future, traders believe the so-called “altseason” is not returning, especially as Bitcoin outperforms altcoins.

When would altcoins recover?

Historically, during bull markets, the cryptocurrency market saw Bitcoin experience a rapid uptrend first. Then, altcoins followed, after BTC surged to a local peak or an all-time high.

Traders foresee a similar pattern playing out in the current price cycle, generally expecting altcoins to recover in 2021. But until BTC stabilizes and completes its rally, traders do not see a proper altcoin uptrend happening.

Since Sept. 13 lows, the Bitcoin dominance index has increased from 56% to 63.4%, recording a 7.4% increase within two months.

However, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said an altseason in the first quarter of 2021 is possible. He said:

“Dominance hit the red zone here. Still waiting until December for a top structure on this one. After that -> Quarter 1 altseason.”

The problem with altcoins is the current dynamic of the cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin rises quickly, altcoins fall as capital cycles back into BTC. If BTC drops, then altcoins drop in tandem, putting altcoins in a precarious position.

A pseudonymous trader known as “DonAlt” said he has been short Ether for several days. He said that if ETH does not recover against Bitcoin, then a broader altcoin market pullback is a possibility. The trader noted:

“I've been short ETH for a couple days now. That said ETHBTC is approaching support. So there is a good chance it bounces here, if it doesn't the entire altcoin market gaps down quite aggressively.”

Similarly, a trader recognized as ""CryptoCapo"" said that the technical structure of altcoins is not compelling in the near term. For traders, that makes Bitcoin more attractive, given that it has portrayed strong momentum throughout October. He emphasized:

“Let's be honest: There are alts that look really bad, alts that look decent, and alts that look good. I don't see any altcoin that looks really good right now. Choose wisely.”

The key is for the Bitcoin rally to cool down

As long as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge rapidly and Ether lags behind, an altseason is highly unlikely in the near term.

A strong sign of an altseason would be a consolidation of the ongoing Bitcoin rally followed by a breakout in the price of ETH.

Considering that BTC/USD broke out of the $13,000 resistance level merely a week ago, technically, an Ether and altcoin market uptrend could still potentially be several months out.

So far, the capital in the altcoin market still seems to be shifting towards Bitcoin, however. As Cointelegraph reported, decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, have continued to bleed volume in October. This indicates that the demand for DeFi tokens is slowing down likely due to Bitcoin's curren momentum.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-s-bottom-line-gets-beefier-on-bitcoin-moves-bad-crypto-news-of-the-week,"It’s been another strong week for Bitcoin. The dollar price is up about 2.5 percent over the week, although that’s still something of a decline from its recent high above $13,400. At one point, Bitcoin fell 4 percent in 24 hours. But bulls remain optimistic and see the price advancing towards $20,000, possibly as early as March. That future price movement will depend on a number of factors, including whether banks follow Paypal into cryptocurrency acceptance; the size of the stimulus expected to counter the new coronavirus outbreak; and the pattern of the hash rate, among other factors. One point of volatility could come at the end of the month: that’s when the BTC options market reaches a $750 million expiration. In the meantime, large amounts of Bitcoin are on the move. A whale has recently transferred a billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoin. It cost them $3.58.

Despite that volatility, Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, thinks that Bitcoin has broken away from its correlation with the stock market and is now a safe haven for investors. Mike Novogratz agrees. He sees Bitcoin as a kind of digital gold: a good way to store value but not something that will function as a currency in the next five years. That opportunity, though, may only be available for Bitcoin. Altcoins are doing less well; Ethereum, for example, has been looking relatively weak despite Bitcoin’s growing strength.

Some companies have been doing well out of that strength. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has made more than $100 million in profit from its Bitcoin investments. That’s more than it’s made analyzing business. Visa might struggle to follow them. The US Department of Justice is now investigating the company’s acquisition of Plaid, a fintech company.

The government has also been investigating social media. A Senate Commerce Committee hearing gave the CEOs of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, a partisan grilling. One solution to the opacity of the companies’ content moderation, though, might be open-source algorithms.

Senators haven’t been alone in engaging in partisan hackery. A group of hackers took over President Trump’s campaign website. The hackers said that they had evidence proving the president’s “criminal involvment and coorperation with foreign actors” (sic)… and asked for funds.

In Japan, a group of companies have come together to create a blockchain-based trade data management system. In Siberia, a new Bitcoin mine will create 100 jobs. Singapore’s biggest bank, DBS, is launching an exchange to swap fiat for cryptocurrencies. And in China, charities are using the blockchain to give donors trust as they raise money for people in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. In the US, though, while Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman has said that machine learning and cloud tech will drive evolution in capital markets, the adoption of the blockchain is “complicated” and “will take longer.”

At least the art world is moving ahead. From art inspired by the blockchain to crypto art and digital marketplaces, artists and auction houses have found new opportunities in blockchain technology. Another reason for optimism.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/happy-birthday-dear-bitcoin-crypto-s-first-white-paper-turns-12,"Has it only been a dozen years since Oct. 31, 2008, that Satoshi Nakamoto published a modest nine-page paper describing a new online payments system called “Bitcoin?” Depending on where one stands, that pseudonymous white paper — its author(s) remain unidentified — fostered either a fintech revolution or, as some believe, “the greatest scam in history.”

To mark the anniversary of the publication of “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” Cointelegraph invited comments on the enduring vision of the paper’s author. Would Satoshi Nakamoto have been pleased with how Bitcoin and blockchain technology have developed and evolved over the past 12 years?

James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Cointelegraph: “It has set in motion a revolution in finance with the rise of DeFi apps, smart contracts, and coin offerings, in addition to a payment revolution that is leading to central bank digital currencies.” Gina Pieters, an assistant instructional professor at the University of Chicago’s economics department, told Cointelegraph: “He would be pleased to see the evolution and new applications of his vision.”

The influence of Bitcoin’s (BTC) white paper goes beyond finance, Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, told Cointelegraph: “Its impact is worthy of being considered alongside other major technical innovations, such as the personal computer and internet.”

Would Satoshi be disappointed?

Satoshi’s vision was for a P2P, or decentralized, digital cash system — as referenced in the white paper’s title. The problem with incumbent digital commerce was that it relied exclusively on “financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments,” Satoshi wrote. This had inherent weaknesses. Transactions could be reversed, banks had to mediate disputes, and transaction costs were high. Satoshi’s solution was presented in the second paragraph of the white paper’s introduction:

“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”

In the 12 years since the paper’s publication, the need for P2P transactions — without interfering third parties — has become something of an article of faith among Bitcoinists. But, on reflection, has this aspect of Satoshi’s vision been fulfilled? David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, told Cointelegraph:

“I think the greatest source of disappointment for Nakamoto would be the increasing centralization of blockchain governance in entities such as mining pools and even central banks, which are on the verge of launching their own cryptocurrencies. Nakamoto’s mission was to challenge the hegemony of central banks, and ironically, the greatest issuers of digital currencies seem likely to be the central banks themselves.”

Angel went further: “Satoshi would be appalled at the politics of concentrated mining pools that currently dominate the Bitcoin protocol.” While Pieters added that Satoshi would be disappointed that the “primary transactions of Bitcoin were not occurring through peer-to-peer trading, but rather intermediated by centralized exchanges or companies.”

Thwarting fraud

The matter of fraud in digital transactions has always loomed, and in Bitcoin’s white paper Satoshi proposed a way to solve the classic “double-spend” problem — where miscreants spend the same coin twice, something not difficult to do with electronic coins. He did this using a “peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.” In this way, explained Satoshi, “transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud.”

Solving the double-spend problem today is considered one of Satoshi’s greatest achievements. His Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked (though the same can’t be said for the many crypto exchanges that trade BTC). Still, fraud associated with digital payments has not been squeezed out of the system. Would this have dismayed Bitcoin’s founder?

Angel said that Satoshi would “have been disappointed that Bitcoin did not turn into an everyday payment medium but instead a store of value for fearful fatcats and tax evaders.” Moreover, Satoshi would “have been saddened by the increase in inequality that Bitcoin’s history has created, with a few early adopters becoming whales and the other 99.99999% of the population as have nots.” Still, one assumes Bitcoin’s creator — whether man, woman or group — would have marveled at the breadth of BTC’s adoption, as Yermack outlined:

“Nakamoto would be astonished by the growth of blockchain projects and the many thousands of digital coins and tokens that have been created in the image of Bitcoin. One suggestive piece of evidence is that Nakamoto fixed the size of the blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB in 2010 and mysteriously commented that ‘we can always increase this later when we need to.’”

He had no inkling that the blockchain would become overloaded within the next five or six years, continued Yermack, “and that a contentious debate, still unresolved today, would break out among different constituencies of Bitcoin about the best way to expand the blockchain’s capacity further.”

In the past 12 years, most of Satoshi’s original software code has been altered or substituted, added Hileman, but still, Bitcoin has retained its key foundational qualities, including “its fixed supply of 21 million coins, open access, and censorship/tamper resistance. I believe Satoshi would be happy with the ongoing software optimizations and improvements to these core foundational characteristics that continue today.”

Was Satoshi an environmentalist?

While the white paper says a lot about transaction fees, CPU power, network nodes, proof-of-work chains, and even the Gambler’s Ruin problem, it says nothing much about the larger world around, including the environment. Angel contends that Satoshi would be shocked by the environmental damage caused by the Bitcoin mining arms race, adding: “At current hash rates and mining efficiency, Bitcoin mining alone is consuming about seven gigawatts of electricity, which is the equivalent to seven Chernobyl power plants.”

And while little is known about Satoshi’s politics, his creation, in the form of the first crypto blockchain, would also be disturbed by the idea of central bank digital currencies, and in some cases, “those currencies are designed for repressive governments to engage in even more surveillance and control over their populations,” added Angel.

Focusing on the white paper proper, Franklin Noll, a monetary historian and the president of Noll Historical Consulting, told Cointelegraph: “His concern was with speedy, anonymous, low cost, non-mediated, non-reversible transactions. So far, Bitcoin transactions — and many other blockchain transactions — have not been found to be all that speedy, anonymous, or low cost.” He further added:

“I believe Satoshi would want to see more use of non-custodial wallets to store and transact Bitcoin,” added Hileman, who explained that custody firms that manage private cryptographic keys on behalf of Bitcoin owners “resemble traditional banks.” Meanwhile, he believes that “Satoshi was not a fan of trusted third-party financial intermediaries.”

What is Satoshi’s legacy?

After a little more than a decade later, what is the significance of Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper? In the financial sphere, “It incentivized financial companies and central banks to prioritize evaluating their technology, considering both increased digitization and ‘always-on’ digital platforms,” Pieters opined, continuing: “In some cases, like the renewed examinations of CBDCs, this has led to explorations of new systems even if it is not directly the adoption of blockchain technology.”

“Bitcoin and blockchain have fundamentally changed the monetary world,” added Noll. “Terms like proof-of-work, distributed ledger technology, decentralized finance, programmable money and smart contracts are now part of the lexicon of anyone serious about the future of money and finance.” Hileman added:

“We are also only beginning to understand the potential impact of blockchain technology in areas outside of finance, such as digital identity, addressing the problem of fake news, and public election tampering.”

“The publication of Nakamoto’s 2008 paper was an important turning point in financial record-keeping,” said NYU’s Yermack. “We are only beginning to understand the ramifications, but they appear to be vast.”

A surprisingly modest document

One won’t find the word “revolution” in Satoshi’s paper. There is nothing about overturning the economic order or narrowing the gap between rich or poor. It’s an unassuming treatise on electronic payments — how they can be made to function effectively.

On his own terms, Satoshi succeeded wildly. He promised a workable P2P digital payment system, and he delivered. The market value of Bitcoin stands at $251 billion 12 years after the idea was unveiled.

Whether Bitcoin is also harming the environment, abetting money launderers or propping up political regimes, goes beyond the scope of his paper. What can be said is that economic decentralization continues to present governance challenges. How much “peer-to-peer” does society really want? The larger global community will have to decide.

Twelve years out from the publication of “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” it’s worth remembering that “it is a dictum of history that revolutions do not always turn out as the founders planned,” Noll told Cointelegraph.",,https://www.coindesk.com/us-banks-could-seek-to-partner-with-or-buy-crypto-custodians-occs-brooks-says,"U.S. banks are looking at ways to handle crypto adoption in the wake of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) July decision to allow banks to provide custody for cryptocurrencies, Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks said in a podcast.

Suffice to say, it’s a great time to be alive for compliance hardliners and a rough patch for privacy advocates, aside from a healthy recent boost in the price of Monero (XMR).

Stepping back and looking at the larger trend, many in the crypto community are now imagining a world with two “Bitcoin blockchains” — or perhaps, two distinct networks of various blockchains. The first is a blessed white blockchain, or “lightchain,” akin to a friendly neighborhood where everybody knows each other’s name; the other is a sinister “darkchain” full of drug traffickers, pimps and terrorists (as far as we know).

Privacy advocates fear that because Know Your Customer rules are being placed on exchanges that custody crypto and that banks and institutional wealth will make crypto mainstream via similar custodial solutions, only those who custody crypto with such institutions will be allowed onto the lovely lightchains. These chains will lie within the lofty ivory pillars of Wall Street and beneath the halls of wealth and power, while the vast unwashed masses who prefer to hold and control their own crypto will be forced into a crypto ghetto on the darkchain.

Anti-Money Laundering compliance

While the basis of these fears is well founded, it is important to remember the original purpose of AML compliance, originating in 1970s America, was to assist law enforcement in its investigations. Maintaining a vast reporting system for monitoring user activity and feeding it to the government, like the modern Transportation Security Administration airport panopticon, is a 21st century, post-9/11 invention of Bush-era America and hardly a prerequisite for a global financial network.

In fact, this recently imposed norm was a major impetus for many privacy-friendly innovations in crypto, including, arguably, Bitcoin (BTC) itself. In other words, the “lightchainers” are justifying potentially removing the privacy from blockchains under the same “War on Terror” rationale for the Patriot Act, only with the possibility of permanently airing your dirty laundry on a public ledger rather than keeping it between the banks and government (and occasionally leaked to Buzzfeed).

More importantly, it has long been obvious that even in the crypto space, the imposition of global mandatory wallet identification and traceability has strained this original “assisting law enforcement” rationale for AML rules. Historically, the Elliptics, CypherTraces and Chainalysises of the world have spent most of their energy working with law enforcement to map out actual criminals and their transactions resulting from actual criminal activity, rather than setting up vast dragnets of everybody’s wallet addresses.

Whether it was Mt. Gox or other exchange hackers, BitLocker scammers or international criminals of many stripes, Bitcoin has a feature that allows blockchain exploration compliance firms to demarcate known bad guys and create an actual “darkchain” not to be mixed into the polite company of the remaining blockchain(s).

This system has worked. Most virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, (i.e., exchanges) use blockchain explorer compliance tools to block and track transactions on the darkchain and assist law enforcement with its investigations. These efforts have also made it much, much harder for actual criminals to launder their crypto on compliant exchanges.

Lightchain vs. darkchain

So, let us reject the thesis that we are barreling toward a “lightchain-vs.-darkchain” dichotomy. Rather, let’s recognize that we already have a small darkchain of proven money launderers that VASPs do not, and should not, work with and should freeze and work with law enforcement to deal with. We then have the splotches of lightchains that exist within VASPs (i.e., exchanges) for which they are, and should be, legally obligated to keep private and share only to the extent they detect darkchain or demonstrable criminal activity, rather than sharing private user information of noncriminals. This leaves us with a third chain, the vast, lovely, delightfully opaque “graychain” blockchains that have served us so well for all these many years.

To “keep blockchain gray,” we must resist the efforts of the lightchain to penetrate the gray by penalizing VASPs and blockchain exploration and compliance tools that engage in unjustified tainting of the gray with the white. In other words, publicizing identifying information of exchange customers should lead to lawsuits and, in Europe, anti-privacy enforcement actions. Likewise, we must resist the darkening of our beloved graychain by policymakers, pundits and so-called crypto lawyers who advocate for penalties on operating in the gray zone.

There is nothing wrong with holding your crypto in a hardware wallet, and to argue that those who exercise healthy cybersecurity by doing so have “something to hide” stains credibility. We must resist this by advocating for the graychains, which are by no actual measures true vectors for money laundering, and by pointing out the irrationality of believing that pseudonymous blockchains are more valuable when they are no longer anonymous at all. In the end, even if the lightchainers are successful, they will be sowing the seeds of even more private forms of money that lie beyond their reach.

Bitcoin will rise in value no matter who wins the US election, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency hedge fund Arca.

A string of positive headlines for Bitcoin last week have lowered the fear-factor for investors to enter the digital market, Dorman told Business Insider in an interview.

""Most conservative people on Wall Street don't want to be the first and don't want to be the last,"" he said. ""Once there's that precedence set, I think it opens the floodgates for everyone else.""

While there's no specific presidential candidate who will make a difference to Bitcoin, Joe Biden might be more favorable for the cryptocurrency in the long term, he said.

Bitcoin and other risk assets are not reliant on who wins the US elections as they will shrug off market uncertainty regardless of the outcome, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency hedge fund Arca.

""They just want to know that there's a winner,"" Dorman told Business Insider in an interview on Thursday.

He said while a majority of investors expect a hung election, or one in which neither party has an overall majority, it doesn't matter who wins because all risk assets will see a huge rise.

Longer term, however, a Joe Biden victory would be better for Bitcoin and gold because that would imply an unprecedented level of government spending, he said. ""I would say Democrats are better for inflation hedges, but as long as there's a clear winner at some point, everything's going higher,"" Dorman said.

Bitcoin has surged more than 4% this week to $13,282 as of Friday, and is up 80% year-to-date, putting the digital currency within proximity to its June 2019 high of $13,880.

It benefited from a stream of supportive headlines last week. PayPal said it would enable users to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin, investor Paul Tudor Jones called it the ""best inflation trade,"" and fintech firms including Square, Microstrategy, and UK fintech Mode disclosed that they had bought Bitcoin as part of their cash reserves.

Dorman, who has been in the asset management business for 17 years, said a billionaire investor like Tudor Jones investing in Bitcoin won't necessarily ignite a bull market, but it has lowered the fear factor of entering the digital asset market.

""Most conservative people on Wall Street don't want to be the first and don't want to be the last,"" he said. ""Once there's that precedent set, I think it opens the floodgates for everyone else. I don't think that alone is enough to start a bull cycle, but I think it is enough to increase the total addressable market of demand for Bitcoin.""

Dorman, who calls himself a Bitcoin bull, said fintech firms are disrupting the traditional finance industry, as they have the ability to move quicker on offering services for digital assets.

""Look at the stock prices of traditional banks versus fintech this year and see how high the PayPals and Squares and the likes are doing relative to JPMorgan and Bank of America,"" he said. ""It is a huge deal. It's a bigger negative to banks than it is a positive to bitcoin, in the sense that you're now offering an additional service that banks can't provide,"" he said about the potential of fintechs.

Dorman does not think Bitcoin is a safe-haven alternative to the US dollar, but said it could provide a hedge against inflation.

John McAfee has shared many details about his life in Spanish prison and chances of extradition to the U.S. He additionally claims to have regained control of his ghost cryptocurrency project.

Prison Life ‘Is an Adventure’

Former U.S. presidential candidate and antivirus software tycoon John McAfee is in Spanish prison awaiting his extradition trial after he was arrested in Spain.

McAfee has been tweeting regularly from prison. “You want to know what prison is like. It’s like a Motel 6 run by Hitler’s SS,” he tweeted, elaborating:

I am content in here. I have friends. The food is good. All is well. Know that if I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine … Prison is an adventure to say the least.

“Spanish prisons are like the Hilton hotel compared to the abject surreality and dehumanization of American prisons,” he described in another tweet. “In Spanish prisons, you are treated as a human being instead of a number. I am treated well.” Admitting that he is “surrounded by murderers, muggers, and thieves,” the antivirus software tycoon maintained that it is “Not as bad as our government of course. But still.”

McAfee Denies Charges Against Him

The former presidential candidate insists that the U.S. government is after him for speaking the truth, particularly against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). “I once publicly called the SEC a festering pustule on the face of America, and the IRS – a legalized criminal gang aspiring to be the equivalent of Hitler’s SS. These are the two agencies accusing me of hideous crimes. I can only assume that they took offense at my remarks.” Nonetheless, he affirmed: “I would not exchange my life in prison for a life of freedom in which I could not speak the truth.”

Regarding the $23 million dollar judgment against him, McAffee claimed: “It was a civil suit not a criminal issue. I never even responded to the suit. It was simply a default judgment.” He declared:

I am charged with tax fraud – which is lying on your tax return. I have filed no returns for many years and have made no secret of it. If I have said nothing how could I have lied. My real crime is speaking publicly about the insanity rampant within our system of government.

Responding to a question from the media about whether the U.S. justice system is just, he said: “If extradited, I face 35 years in prison for multiple counts of refusing to file tax returns. Had I chosen armed robbery, I would’ve received 5 years maximum. You tell me if it’s just.”

Furthermore, McAfee tweeted on Friday: “I’m in prison for refusing to file tax returns, while government bureaucrats use your taxes for private planes, lavish parties and all other benefits of their power.” Commenting on the upcoming U.S. presidential election, he said, “If you think this election, whatever its results, will change this system, you will be sadly disappointed.”

McAfee Still Pumping His Ghost Cryptocurrency

Although charged by the SEC for pumping tokens, McAfee is still pumping his ghost cryptocurrency. He confirmed from prison that Ghost is the only crypto project he is involved with at present. Recalling that he abandoned the project in August due to a fallout with the management, he clarified:

I have returned to controlling the Ghost development. My feud with management has ended. With the announcement that we will soon release a private stable coin, will mark a new era in transacting crypto business. Transaction fees will be shared amongst all Ghost holders.

“When our private stablecoin is released, it will revolutionize crypto transactions. I have capable managers and communicate frequently from prison,” he claimed. “My work with Ghost revolves entirely around our development of the world’s first private stablecoin. Version one will be a wrapped DAI. Later we will have a new stable, private blockchain. Holders of Ghost will share all transaction fee profits for the stablecoin.”

He also commented on Paypal’s announcement to begin supporting cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, on its platform. “Paypal’s acceptance of cryptocurrency signals, I believe, a new wave of cryptocurrency acceptance worldwide. Governments around the world will have to get used to cryptocurrencies.” He further tweeted: “Paypal to take crypto. The IRS must be pissing itself.”

What’s Next for McAfee

The U.S. government wants him extradited from Spain, which McAfee says he is 100% certain will not happen because the Spanish “courts will see the clear resentment of the American government toward my public condemnations of their increasing corruption. They also understand how simple it is for a corrupt system to manufacture evidence that can prove anything against anyone who is a public enemy. They will decline my extradition,” he wrote. As such, he said he will not need a lawyer in the U.S., emphasizing that “There is zero chance that Spain will extradite me.”

McAfee revealed that when he is released, he will do “The same as before,” which is to “continue speaking against the cancer that has invaded every organ of the U.S. government bureaucracy.” He added that he is not sorry for what he has done. “I have followed my heart and stood up for my beliefs. I will never regret that,” he said.

On the subject of him allegedly being wanted for murder in Belize, McAfee insisted:

This is false. I was not charged with murder nor was I a suspect. The Belizean authorities will confirm this. I was a person of interest like all of the murdered man’s neighbors. I chose not to be questioned. I was already at war with the Belizean government.

McAfee posted his prison address on Friday after he said many people have asked for it. “Letters only. No packages. No money, drugs or weapons please. Everything is opened,” he warned. Finally, the cybersecurity tycoon said he would not reveal where he had been hiding: “I will not say. I may need to hide again someday.”

Cryptocurrency exchanges started as a means to enable crypto enthusiasts to trade digital coins outside the traditional financial system on a decentralized and largely autonomous basis.

It is likely that combined with regulatory recognition and development of digital market infrastructures, acceptance of essential Anti-Money Laundering practices, investment in security protection systems, and recognition of investor protection measures will see these businesses continue to expand and potentially merge or compete on an even footing with existing regulated marketplaces.

The success of these platforms in allowing an unregulated free-flow of value across borders has unsurprisingly resulted in interest from governments and regulatory bodies. Initial skepticism was replaced by concern over weaknesses in relation to AML, fraud and investor protection measures. As crypto exchanges have improved their systems to meet AML and investor protection requirements, there is a begrudging recognition that these platforms have brought much-needed modernization and democratization to a market that has generally been seen as remote and privileged.

Crypto exchanges have provided 24-hour, global access to trading venues with participants eligible from all walks of life and able to participate directly through accessing online trading tools and graphics, which have historically been available almost solely to a limited set of professional investors.

Crypto regulation overview

Crypto assets have generally been on the outer edge of the regulatory perimeter, but are increasingly facing pressure to be included within the regulatory framework.

The first key step in this direction at an international level was the extension of the AML standards announced in June 2019 for crypto-related businesses from the Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body for fighting financial crime.

In the European Union, this was followed by the adoption of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, or 5AMLD, which brought crypto-asset exchanges and custodian wallet providers into the scope of the EU AML regime. As a result, in-scope crypto asset firms operating in the EU and the United Kingdom are now subject to the full suite of AML obligations applicable to most financial market participants, such as the need to undertake customer due diligence checks when onboarding a new client. In addition, they are required to register with the relevant national competent authorities where they intend to carry on crypto-related business.

The general regulatory attitude

The general approach to the regulatory treatment of crypto assets has been more complicated. At an EU-wide level, the position so far has been to apply the existing regulatory framework to crypto assets that have the characteristics of regulated assets. Specific regulations such as outlawing the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors are imposed, but more specific requirements are considered necessary.

Exchanges dealing in digital assets are therefore subject to regulation if the assets traded fall within this regulatory perimeter. To a large extent, this has meant understanding the application of the existing regulatory framework and applying this to relevant circumstances, relying on interpretative guidance where necessary.

As a result, two main categories of crypto assets, which function in a similar manner as regulated instruments, and their respective service providers have been brought within the scope of existing rules. These are digital assets akin to “financial instruments” (generally capturing crypto assets used as means for raising finance and derivatives), but are being treated with existing rules for tokens functioning as “electronic money.” This captures crypto assets designed to facilitate payment transactions or some stablecoins.

Importantly, this means that crypto exchanges trading digital securities, such as DLT-based shares, bonds, fund units or derivatives — often referred to as security tokens — are required to obtain authorization as regulated trading venues to do business in the EU. This would also capture EU-based crypto exchanges trading particularly popular instruments, such as derivatives referencing Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies as underlying assets. This has been supplemented by jurisdictions putting in place bespoke regimes for the crypto sector, for example, clarifying aspects concerning the use of the underlying DLT technology (e.g., Luxembourg) or closing gaps in existing rules (e.g., France).

Digital securities

In the securities space, significant steps are being made toward developing a credible digital market infrastructure for issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities. Most notably, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has recently granted a MiFID licence to Archax Limited, which has become the first fully-authorized trading venue for digital securities in the U.K.

At the same time, established exchanges are building their own “digital versions,” such as the Börse Stuttgart Digital Exchange in Germany and the SIX Digital Exchange in Switzerland. However, despite these developments, integrating digital solutions with existing market infrastructures remains challenging, not least due to constraints stemming from existing rules around settlement finality requirements in the post-trading systems.

In an effort to unlock opportunities for innovation in the space, the European Commission has recently published a proposal for a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT, which aims to create a bespoke legal regime for the application of DLT in post-trade services and would allow for the creation of digital securities settlement systems.

Regulating crypto exchanges

Some of the largest crypto exchanges are looking to obtain regulatory licences across the world in order to be able to directly compete with incumbent financial institutions, adapt to user demand for more sophisticated services, and enhance their own credibility in the market.

For example, in March 2018, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase obtained an e-money licence from the U.K. FCA, as well as from the Central Bank of Ireland in 2019, allowing it to issue e-money and provide payment services, thereby enhancing its fiat-to-crypto services. Kraken has recently obtained a banking license from the State of Wyoming to create a special purpose depository institution (Kraken Financial), which will allow it to provide deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.

With a view to enhancing market integrity and investor confidence, the EU Commission put out a proposal on Sept. 23 for a regulation on markets in crypto assets, or MiCA. The draft regulation captures crypto assets such as “asset-referenced tokens” (commonly known as “stablecoins”) as well as “utility tokens.”

Under the MiCA draft, crypto exchanges operating in the EU are required to obtain regulatory authorization and are subject to strict prudential and conduct requirements. In addition, the draft rules include prescriptive requirements around admission of crypto asset instruments to trading, including the requirement to publish a white paper with specified content.

European Commission proposals have to go through a long legislative process before they become binding law. The MiCA however, is likely to be a significant step toward establishing credibility and structure in creating a viable crypto asset industry in the EU, which will identify the contrasting regulatory framework for security-type crypto assets and non-security-type crypto assets. For many, the process of imposing regulatory requirements at all in the pure crypto assets sector will be an anathema that stifles innovation and creates barriers to entry for smaller fintech firms. However, this is the most likely approach to establishing a long-term, viable marketplace.

What it means for the industry

There is significant interest from large institutional players in entering the crypto asset space. Some of the biggest European institutions have extensive digital asset programs. As an example, ING is currently working with industry participants on a digital custody and safekeeping solution within the FCA sandbox that will provide institutional-grade security for digital holdings and transfers of digital assets. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently gave the “all-clear” to U.S. banks to provide cryptocurrency custody services for their customers, a development that could put crypto asset service providers (including exchanges) in direct competition with traditional players.

Going forward, the innovation, democratization and expansion of access brought about by crypto exchanges, as well as an improved financial regulatory recognition of their services, will be combined with the digitalization of traditional asset securities and development of market infrastructure for digital trading. This is likely to lead to a powerful dynamic for combinations and mergers between rapidly developing crypto exchanges and incumbent institutions. We are currently at the forefront of advising on developments in the space and welcome the significant changes undoubtedly ahead.

Crypto adoption will gain further steam in 2021, according to experts speaking with Cryptonews.com. To date, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptoassets have had a very good (yet turbulent) 2020, and with the global economy expected to continue stagnating into 2021 (and beyond), crypto might win additional converts with its promise of greater returns and independence from traditional finance.

2020: How accurate were predictions last year?

Industry players were pretty accurate when sharing their predictions with Cryptonews.com last year.

They predicted that Bitcoin’s May halving would increase demand for the cryptocurrency: this has generally been the case, with the price of bitcoin rising from a low of USD 5,000 to just under 9,000 in the weeks before May 11, and then rising steadily afterwards, briefly hitting USD 14,000 on some exchanges on October 31. However, it still can be argued what was the effect of the halving alone.

BTC price chart:

They also predicted the rise of DeFi (decentralized finance): from a total value locked in of USD 676m on January 1, the sector has grown to USD 11bn as of writing.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) were another thing they said “will gain traction as an idea.” This was also largely true: the People’s Bank of China completed a digital yuan trial in October, while a healthy number of other central banks — such as the European Central Bank and US Federal Reserve — are exploring their own alternatives, while Combodia and Bahamas have already launched their CBDCs.

Lastly, joining up with their prediction regarding Bitcoin’s halving, experts also suggested that the “coming years could speed up cryptocurrency ownership, particularly if regional and/or global recessions occur.” As reported, crypto usership is going up at an exponential rate, per researchers at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, with over 100 million people worldwide now making use of cryptoassets.

2021: More BTC adoption, more stablecoin adoption

The first prediction for 2021 is that we’ll see a continuation of the move towards BTC that we witnessed in the latter half of 2020.

“Bitcoin will still be the main focus. The institutional demand for bitcoin is increasing this year, and will continue to increase next year,” predicted Bendik Schei, the Head of Research at Arcane Crypto.

Schei suggested that bitcoin adoption next year will be facilitated by the “massive development in the infrastructure for BTC,” which has improved the accessibility of the cryptocurrency for institutional investors.

“Now, the data also shows that the institutions are coming. In 2020, we’ve seen new records and strong growth on CME and Bakkt, massive inflows for Grayscale and public companies buying bitcoin as a reserve asset.”

Most other industry figures and commentators agree with this analysis. Nick Cote, the Senior Analyst at crypto-trading platform Hxro Labs, is one of them.

“Bitcoin stands to gain substantially in 2021 due to further institutionalization of the space, as more custodial services and insurance offerings become available. Adoption can be reflected not only by price trending up, but also in the amount of unique wallet addresses, total dollar value transacted on-chain, and further global penetration of Bitcoin's brand, which continues to benefit from its first-mover advantage,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Related to bitcoin’s use as a hedge against inflation will be the parallel growth of stablecoins such as tether (USDT), which serve to provide liquidity in markets where fiat-to-crypto trading isn’t easy.

“Stablecoin usage — and tether in particular — is especially high in East Asia, making up 33% of all value transacted on-chain in the region. That share has been rising steadily this year, beating out BTC as the most-received cryptocurrency in the region,” said Kim Grauer, the Head of Research at Chainalysis.

Grauer added that Chainalysis expects stablecoins to continue growing in popularity around the world, “especially in geographies where they offer a stable store of value and are effective in carrying out everyday transactions.”

Ethereum and DeFi

DeFi has witnessed spectacular growth this year, which in turn has boosted Ethereum (ETH) and solidified its position as the number-two cryptoasset/platform. This might continue next year, particularly as the low-interest rate environment drives investors towards DeFi.

“Ethereum is also positioned to see increased adoption,” said Jason Wu, the CEO and co-founder of DeFi network DeFiner.

“First, it is the network around which the vast majority of DeFi activity orbits. There are also massive numbers of transactions and trades involving stablecoins, and the largest ones all operate on the Ethereum network.”

Wu also suggested that 2021 will witness the rise of ERC-20-based non-fungible tokens, which “will see continued rise in the art, creative, and, eventually, the financial services space.”

Interoperability chains

As the major platforms and the wider ecosystem see greater use in 2021, we might also see the greater use of platforms which enable interoperability and communication with external data sources.

“Chainlink will enjoy the most adoption in 2021. The underlying technology solves real world problems and brings crypto closer to mass adoption,” said Luciano Nonnis, the CEO and co-founder of trading/research platform DXone.

Chainlink (LINK) provides a framework for building decentralized oracle networks so that smart contracts can access data inputs and outputs in the non-crypto world. Nonnis added that it will bridge “the gap between blockchain and industry.”

Aside from predicting growth for NEM (XEM) and its Symbol platform, NEM Group Chief Investment Officer Dave Hodgson agreed that interoperability blockchains will have a busy 2021.

“Other key players including Cosmos, Cardano and Polkadot are due to support several use cases, making it easy to migrate off Ethereum, while supporting similar kinds of contracts which may prove beneficial if Ethereum faces similar scalability and cost challenges,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Obstacles remain

Given that Bitcoin was created in response to an economic crisis and the world is facing new economic headwinds, 2021 may be another good year for crypto adoption. However, we shouldn’t get too ahead of ourselves, since crypto will also face a few obstacles that need to be overcome in order to maximize adoption.

“I personally think BTC as a means of payment needs improvement on the [user experience] side,” said Bendik Schei. “Lightning Network will be important in the coming years to enable instant payments and allow innovation in several sectors, but it is still early days.”

Likewise, Ethereum also has some of its own teething problems to overcome, at least according to Dave Hodgson.

“Ethereum is, of course, a project to watch, but seems to be suffering from project fatigue with increasing numbers speaking to other chains due, I suspect, to uncertainty on Ethereum 2.0 dates and scaling timescales.”

These qualifications aside, we can at least say one thing about 2021: if it’s even half as eventful as this year, it should be an interesting year for cryptocurrency adoption.

Brace For More Bitcoin Flash Crashes In This Bull Market - Hut 8 Founder",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-got-bitcoin-trick-or-treaters-rewarded-with-crypto,"While many children dressed as ghosts, goblins and witches last night may have been disappointed to find an inedible thin piece of cardboard left out in a goodie bag, a lucky few recognized the treat as a Bitcoin prize.

According to an tweet Saturday from Brad Mills, the crypto user filled a Halloween candy box with more than just chocolates and sweets — he also added $200 in Bitcoin (BTC) gift cards. Mills posted a video of him adding the two gift cards, each worth roughly 0.007 BTC, following the coin’s rise to $14,000 and filmed the reactions of trick-or-treaters in his Canadian neighborhood.

One boy in a white costume was the first to meticulously dig through the box before saying to his group of friends, “I just got a $100 Bitcoin gift card!”

Someone else in the group retrieved the other card from the candy pile, repeatedly cheering, “I got Bitcoin! I got Bitcoin!” — leaving one of the two remaining children in chicken and sloth costumes to come up empty-handed before asking, “What’s a Bitcoin?” Mills’ family later gave a few more BTC cards to a visiting group of girls who had heard about the crypto giveaway.

I put some $100 @RiseWallet #Bitcoin cards in my box of Halloween candy & captured the moment when some random trick-or-treaters found them.



""DUDE I JUST GOT BITCOIN""

Though minors aren’t specifically barred from HODLing or trading cryptocurrencies in some countries, many exchanges still require verification to ensure its users are over the age of 18. As the children from Mills’ video are in Canada, they have access to Bitcoin ATMs, but most likely not local regulated exchanges to deposit their BTC or trade it for fiat.

Despite some of the children involved not understanding about the coins, reactions from the crypto community were positive, with many Twitter users stating it was a good lesson in scarcity.

“This feels historic,” said crypto statistician Willy Woo. “When these kids come into power there'll only be 0.002 BTC per person to go around.”

Other good samaritans have given away cryptocurrency, seemingly in an effort to promote adoption.

Crypto lender Genesis provided $5.2 billion in new loans in the third quarter of 2020, more than double its previous record of $2.2 billion in the preceding quarter.

Issued to corporate borrowers such as hedge funds and trading firms, the loans are mainly denominated in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), and cash.

According to the U.S. company’s Q3 Digital Asset Report shared with news.Bitcoin.com on Oct. 30, Genesis grew its active loans outstanding 50% to $2.1 billion from $1.4 billion in the second quarter.

Altogether, Genesis has processed a total of $13.6 billion worth of crypto loans since it started its lending business in March 2018.

As a percentage of the total loan portofolio, bitcoin-based loans fell sharply in Q3, tanking to 40.8% from 51.2% previously. BCH loans almost remained stagnant at 4.3% while ETH borrowing nearly doubled to 12.4%.

“The main driver of this portfolio shift came from the impact of liquidity mining on decentralized finance (defi) protocols,” said Genesis.

“We saw defi interest rate arbitrage drive significant new issuance where our trading counterparties started actively borrowing ETH and stablecoins to lever up liquidity mining strategies. These counterparties, at the same time, borrowed the associated governance tokens such as UNI, YFI, COMP, and LEND to hedge their future in-kind earnings.”

The lender says it is seeing massive growth across all its business lines, including derivatives and spot trading.

In the review quarter, derivatives volume – both options and futures – soared 150% to $1 billion from $400 million previously. Genesis only started trading derivatives in Q2 2020. Spot volume rose about 15% quarter-on-quarter to $4.5 billion, it said.

But then there are weeks in which a lot happens, and pieces fall into place with loud clangs and reverberations.

This past week was one of those, and the pieces in question are being largely overlooked as they are settling into place in a relatively small corner of the crypto landscape. Yet, their impact is significant even at this early stage. And, as part of the bigger picture, these pieces are forming the base of a new crypto-based financial system whose influence is likely to extend further than many currently realize.

I’m talking about what’s happening in Wyoming. This week saw two significant announcements originating from the state which, together with other proactive legal initiatives, are creating long-awaited bridges between traditional markets and crypto markets.

Regulatory clarity

So what happened?

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

This week the Wyoming Division of Banking issued a “no-action” letter to Two Ocean Trust, a Wyoming-chartered trust company that provides wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals, family offices and advisers. This authorizes it to custody crypto and traditional assets under Wyoming law.

That in itself is interesting, as it means that clients will be able to include crypto assets in a diversified portfolio without looking for a supplementary manager or custodian. This goes a long way toward overcoming the “hassle” barrier to crypto investing, at which investors’ enthusiasm for the idea is dampened by the additional steps needed.

But the no-action letter goes further: it classifies Two Ocean Trust as a “qualified custodian” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, making it the first firm to get official clearance to use this term specifically when it comes to crypto asset custody. This is a big deal because, under the SEC Custody Rule, investment advisers are required to store customer assets with a “qualified custodian.” The crypto markets have not, until now, had official clarity on how the definition of “qualified custodian” as set out in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 could apply to blockchain-based assets.

Several notable firms offer crypto custody services through state-chartered trust companies. This makes them “qualified” and it makes them “custodians,” but it does not guarantee that they meet the definition as set out in the Advisers Act. This states that “qualified custodians” include banks, savings associations, registered broker-dealers and futures commission merchants. Trust companies can be considered banks if, according to Section 202 the Act, “a substantial portion of the business … consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks.”

Not all of the current cohort of crypto custodian trust companies do, so technically they’re not “qualified custodians”, according to the Advisers Act. The thing is, that doesn’t really matter when it comes to bitcoin, ether and other decentralized cryptocurrencies, because the qualified custodian requirement only applies to securities. Investment managers who want to handle bitcoin and ether for their clients don’t have to use a “qualified custodian.” But they would probably want to, given the opportunity, for the regulatory support. And official confirmation on where cryptocurrencies and other digital assets stand when it comes to custody requirements has been eagerly awaited, given the risk investment advisers could run if their clients’ assets are mishandled.

What is significant here is not that a trust company is offering digital asset custody. That’s not new. The big deal is the legal clarity. A state regulator has officially recognized the custody of digital assets as a regulated activity, filling a gap that has been rife with unclear definitions and confusing boundaries. The scale is still very small – this is one no-action letter for one new and relatively small company in one sparsely populated state.

But in terms of potential reach, it is a big step. Regulation in the U.S. tends to build on regulation. A precedent has been set, and both clients and other service providers will no doubt take note.

Spreading out

The other main news of the week was the approval by the Wyoming State Banking Board of a Special Purpose Depositary Institution (SPDI) charter for Avanti Financial, making it the second company to become, effectively, a “crypto bank.” Avanti will be able to accept and custody fiat and digital asset deposits, while being designated a “bank” for regulatory purposes. Kraken was the first a few weeks ago, and Avanti not only broadens the field; it is also pushing the boundaries in terms of innovative service.

Like Kraken, Avanti is a crypto- and traditional-asset custodian that will have access to the federal window once a few more requirements are met. For institutions, this access to emergency funding is an added layer of assurance, and the official authorization to custody digital assets provides further validation of cryptocurrencies as an investable asset group.

What’s more, Avanti will not benefit from FDIC protection for its deposits, nor will it be able to make loans, so its deposits will be 100% backed by custodied assets.

Beyond granting the charter, the Wyoming State Banking Board also approved the future issue of the Avit, a blockchain-based token that represents “programmable electronic cash,” according to Avanti founder and CEO Caitlin Long. This innovative approach to asset-backed value in theory will remove some of the legal uncertainty regarding stablecoin settlement enforceability, in that it represents a token 100% backed by bank assets.

There are still a few legal hoops for Avanti and Avit to jump through, and reciprocity in key financial states such as New York is unclear. Also, as Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon told CoinDesk earlier this week, it is unclear how the federal government will respond to the state’s initiatives. But a legal precedent has been set that could form the basis of future lawmaking. What’s more, the clarity and support for financial innovation (Avanti’s charter request was approved by a unanimous commission) could attract both traditional and crypto businesses as well as clients to Wyoming, further encouraging regulatory progress even beyond the state’s borders.

Remote corners

Financial law is a complicated plate of entwined definitions and delegated authority that lacks the detail needed for innovations to take comfortable root. Wyoming seems to be tackling this confusion head on, paving the way for clarity to extend to other jurisdictions and applications.

Not that long ago, crypto markets were referred to as the “Wild West.” According to Wikipedia, Wyoming is sometimes known as the “Cowboy State.” The metaphor is both fitting and misleading – it’s not the land of the lawless, it’s the land that makes laws appropriate for the territory.

To further underline the symbolism, the state’s official nickname is the “Equality State.” Yesterday was the 12th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper, which offered a glimpse of a decentralized system of financial transfers that had equality and censorship resistance at its core. Bitcoin was nurtured in its early years by a group of idealists that hoped to change finance from the remote edges of influence.

Wherever they are now, I like to think that they would be both encouraged and astonished to see it actually happening. Sure, the impact is beholden to laws, institutions and centralized authority. But it is originating in the least populous state in the world’s largest economy, far from the traditional centers of power.

Can you think of anything more “crypto” than that?

(Note: We use Bitcoin with uppercase when talking about the network, and bitcoin with lowercase, or BTC, when referring to the asset.)

Anyone know what's going on yet?

This is starting to feel a bit like one of those old-school TV game shows where the contestants have to pick a door behind which might or might not lie a gleaming prize. Only the doors in question are “big worries of the month” and the prize is not exactly gleaming, but is a welcome understanding of what is driving market sentiment swings.

You could pick election uncertainty, possible civil unrest, pandemic surge, likely oil price crash, income cliff, looming bankruptcies, currency turmoil and I’m sure there are others I’m forgetting. I’ll throw in for good measure confusion as to why the market didn’t start crashing sooner or hasn’t crashed further. I know, I know – flows of funds and all that – but it doesn’t feel sustainable, or even that it should be.

Against that gloomy backdrop, bitcoin yet again outperformed other asset groups, in spite of a slump in sympathy with the wobbly global markets threw earlier this week.

Should markets get thrown into turmoil next week as the U.S. election grabs the world’s attention, bitcoin will probably join in the chaos. The progress this year in the evolution of cryptocurrency as an investable asset group is building tailwinds for lower correlations with stocks and even with gold.

CHAIN LINKS

Software company MicroStrategy is looking to add to its $521 million stash of bitcoin, the company’s president said Tuesday during the business intelligence firm’s earnings conference call. TAKEAWAY: The notion of using BTC purchases as a PR stunt is alarming. Sure, it might push the BTC price up, which is good for industry interest. But, as with most hype-fueled stunts, it introduces risk which does not feel properly quantified – and if (when?) a company’s balance sheet suffers because of BTC volatility, that won’t help the market’s reputation. Call me old-fashioned, but I also have an issue with a company saying it “will” buy more BTC, when it turns out the CEO has a sizable personal holding (which will presumably benefit from the intention signaling, while the company ends up having to buy at a worse price).

U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase suffered an outage earlier this week, apparently due to “feed issues,” as the bitcoin price was rising. TAKEAWAY: Although you’ll hear me talk a lot about how the crypto markets are maturing, the fact that a major exchange can go down during a sharp price rise (and this is not as infrequent an occurrence as we would like) highlights two things: 1) that the market infrastructure is not exactly mature yet, and 2) a layer of intermediaries to fulfill the role of broker (routing orders to whichever exchange has the best price at the time) would add to market resilience. Clients who had funded accounts at Coinbase would have found themselves restricted from trading during the outage, unless they also have funded accounts at other exchanges as well – not an optimal trading situation nor an efficient use of capital.

Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit has listed bitcoin options contracts that allow traders to bet on a potential price rally to $40,000 next year. TAKEAWAY: The options expire in March and June of next year. According to skew.com, the options-based probability that the BTC price exceeds that by those dates is too minimal to even appear on the chart.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Tuesday that William Hinman, the director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance, is planning to conclude his tenure later this year. TAKEAWAY: Hinman was the first official at the agency to publicly share the view that Ethereum’s native currency ETH was not a security. His departure is relevant to crypto markets since the Commission will be losing a relatively well-informed and thoughtful member who helped form some of the agency’s early crypto-related initiatives. It is also relevant given the likelihood that his eventual replacement will end up having a meaningful voice in the approval of future crypto ETF approvals. Neither presidential candidate has offered much insight into their plans for financial regulation, so clarity on this issue may be some time in coming.

Bitwise Asset Management, a provider of cryptocurrency index funds to professional investors, has broken through the $100 million mark in AUM. TAKEAWAY: This is a strong indicator of the growth in institutional interest in crypto assets, and the figures contain an interesting twist: the bulk of the growth was not in bitcoin but in the firm’s multi-asset Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund.

Crypto investment manager Grayscale Investments (owned by CoinDesk parent DCG) has published its second annual survey of investors. Some findings I found interesting:

55% of those surveyed expressing an interest, vs. 36% in 2019.

83% of investors surveyed have made a bitcoin investment in the past year.

38% of bitcoin investors have invested in the past four months, and two thirds cited COVID-19 concerns as the reason for doing so.

Interest is highest in the 35- to 44-year-old cohort, with 68% expressing interest.

65% said that the small minimum investment was a motivating factor. 59% of investors were attracted by the prospect of growth.

INX Limited, a cryptocurrency exchange that went public through the issuance of tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain last month, has agreed to buy U.S. security token broker-dealer Openfinance Securities. TAKEAWAY: This boosts INX’s business model by bringing into its digital asset exchange mix an alternative trading system and a broker-dealer license. The company also this week announced that it intends to trade on the alternative market Canadian Securities Exchange once it wraps up its initial public offering, which could bring in greater liquidity.",2020-11-01 22:01:22+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-bnb-ada-bch-link,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied about 90% year-to-date and has risen close to 191% from its March lows. The rise has been gradual without much fanfare, which suggests that crypto believers are the ones who have been buying in 2020.

October’s monthly close at $13,798.99 is the highest ever, surpassing the December 2017 close at $13,789.68. The strong performance of Bitcoin may now attract the momentum players and the speculators who look to benefit from the strength.

If that happens, then Bitcoin could pick up momentum and surprise investors to the upside. This could result in traders selling their altcoins to invest in Bitcoin. Hence, the altseason looks to be over in the short-term.

Three of the top-five cryptocurrencies analyzed today may offer a trading opportunity to the upside while the other two may continue to decline further. Let’s watch the critical levels that may indicate the start of a trending move.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin rose above the $13,973.50 overhead resistance and reached an intraday high of $14,101.91 on Oct. 31. Although the bulls failed to sustain the price above the resistance, they have not given up much ground to the downside.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

This suggests that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry because they expect another attempt by the bulls to propel the price above the resistance.

Both the 10-day exponential moving average ($13,309) and the 50-day simple moving average ($11,505) are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the overbought territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command.

If the BTC/USD pair closes above $14,000, the next leg of the uptrend could begin that can reach $16,500.

However, if the bulls again fail to sustain the price above $14,000, then the short-term traders may dump their positions and the bears could initiate short positions. A break below the 10-day EMA will be the first sign that the momentum has weakened.

The bears are likely to gain an upper hand if the pair drops and sustains below the critical support at $12,460.

The pair is currently attempting to hold above the 10-EMA. If that happens and the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the $13,973.50–$14,101.92 resistance zone, a new uptrend is likely.

However, the bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the upside momentum is weakening. If the sellers can sink the pair below the 10-EMA, a drop to the 50-SMA and then to $13,000 will be on the cards. The strong support in the $12,750–$13,000 zone could attract buyers.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the $28.50 support on Oct. 30 but managed to bounce from the intraday lows and close above $28.50. However, the doji candlestick pattern on Oct. 31 suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears.

BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are currently attempting to resolve the indecision to the downside and gain the upper hand. If the BNB/USD pair breaks and closes below $27.50, it will increase the possibility of a drop to $24.86.

The downsloping 10-day EMA ($29.47) and the RSI in the negative zone suggests that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price reverses direction and rises above $28.50, then it will suggest a few more days of consolidation.

The 4-hour chart shows that the recovery from $27.5111 is facing stiff resistance at the 10-EMA. A break below $28 could challenge the $27.50 support, which if broken, the next stop could be $26.50.

Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, suggesting an advantage to the bears.

This view will be invalidated if the pair turns around and rises above $29. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels and will increase the possibility of a rise to $30.50.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) broke below the bearish rising wedge pattern on Oct. 26 and plunged to the $0.0891 support. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support and push the price above the moving averages.

ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the downsloping 10-day EMA ($0.988) and the RSI below 43 suggest that bears are in control. Therefore, the bounce is likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.

If the ADA/USD pair turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the $0.0891 support. Such a move will open the gates for a decline to the next support at $0.0755.

This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the moving averages. Such a move could result in a rally to $0.11.

The bulls have pushed the price above the 10-EMA on the 4-hour chart. The pair could now move up to the 50-SMA where bears may again step in and sell.

Although the 50-SMA is still sloping down, the 10-EMA is attempting to turn up and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced in the short-term.

However, if the pair turns down from the current levels or the 50-SMA, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the $0.0891 support. If they succeed, the next leg of the down move could begin.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. However, as this setup suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears, it is better to wait for the price to break above the triangle before taking a directional bet.

BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 59, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could move up to $280 and then to $296.87.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the critical support at $242. The 50-day SMA ($239) is placed just below this support, hence, the bulls may buy a drop to this zone.

The bulls had pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle but they could not sustain the higher levels and the bears have dragged the price back into the triangle.

However, if the pair bounces off the 50-SMA or the 10-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the momentum could pick up and a rally to $280 is likely.

This positive view will be negated if the price breaks below the moving averages and drops below the symmetrical triangle.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. Although the pace of rise has been slow, the altcoin has been making successive higher highs and higher lows.

LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The LINK/USD pair is currently correcting after turning down from the overhead resistance at $13. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.

The bulls are likely to purchase the drop to the support line of the channel. If the price rebounds off this support with strength, the bulls may again attempt to push the pair above $13.

This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the channel. Such a move could drag the price down to $8.3817 and below that to $7.2869.

The bulls are currently attempting to defend the uptrend line. If they can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could start its journey towards $13.

However, the 10-EMA has flattened out and the RSI has been trading in the negative territory, which suggests that bears are attempting a comeback in the short-term.

If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line, the pair could drop to the support line of the channel. The bulls will attempt to defend this support and if they succeed, the pair may rise to the downtrend line.

The resulting guidance leaves the reader with an impression that its authors have a sound understanding of how the focal asset class works as well as a certain fixation on the ways it can be misused, as some observers contend.

In the highly charged atmosphere of the final weeks before the presidential election, with high-profile enforcement actions against the people behind crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX and the U.S. government’s sweeping anti-monopoly push against Silicon Valley looming in the background, the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework seems like part of some larger political and regulatory dynamic. How does the release of the document fit into the grand scheme of things, and what message is it meant to convey?

Timing and context

One reason why even a modest uptick in enforcement activity in the digital asset space can feel like a full-blown clampdown is that U.S. government agencies have so far been rather selective when deciding whether or not to go after unscrupulous crypto actors.

The lack of specific regulations, as well as the infamous confusion as to which regulatory body is taking point, has left a general strategy of stepping in only to prosecute the most egregious cases, as opposed to blanket enforcement. The DoJ’s introduction of the Crypto Enforcement Framework could suggest that the tide is turning.

Andrew Hinkes, co-founder of consultancy Athena Blockchain and an attorney at law firm Carlton Fields, sees the report as mainly a recap of law enforcement efforts in the blockchain space over the past six years, however, one that indicates a clear upward trend:

“Different federal agencies mentioned in the report, such as the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN, have all been steadily increasing their regulatory and enforcement activity in the cryptocurrency space as that space has grown. Much of the report collects and describes the different agencies’ actions over the past few years.”

Barry Boss, co-chair of the commercial litigation department at law firm Cozen O’Connor, noted that the DoJ has so far been treading “fairly lightly” in terms of enforcing everyday regulatory requirements, perhaps taking its time to understand the market as it develops.

It seems unlikely that the release of the present enforcement guidelines has been timed to any particular developments in the cryptocurrency market, as the comprehensive 83-page report has been many months in the making.

Speaking about the general political moment, Arlo Devlin-Brown, partner at Covington & Burling in white-collar law and investigations, observed that cryptocurrency enforcement is far from being among the hot-button issues of the 2020 presidential election:

“I suspect that this task force, like other DOJ task forces, is seeking to complete outstanding reports prior to a potential change of administration in January. That said, I don’t think this issue is particularly relevant to electoral politics, and I don’t foresee significant changes in cryptocurrency enforcement priorities at the DOJ should Biden win the Presidential election.”

The message

The guidance document details the DoJ’s priorities and strategies with regard to the maturing cryptocurrency industry, aiming to inform the law enforcement community, market participants and the general public both at home and abroad. Apart from this, parts of the report can be read as a signal of what certain subsets of crypto stakeholders can expect for the future.

Boss told Cointelegraph that the new guidelines hint at the DoJ’s willingness to ramp up enforcement. In his opinion, the report serves to “put the cryptocurrency community on notice.” This time, it won’t be just for the most brazen criminals:

“There have been several studies that have shown that significant volumes of terrorist financing, money laundering, and other illicit proceeds are funneled through major, established exchanges. DOJ made clear in its framework that it is aware of this problem and that enforcement of federal criminal laws, including KYC and AML requirements, is part of its framework for addressing it.”

Hinkes of Athena Blockchain called the report a message “to persuadable participants in the cryptocurrency marketplace and industry” to remind them that “they should stay on the right side of the regulatory line because the federal government is committing substantial resources to combating criminal activity associated with, facilitated by, or targeted against cryptocurrencies.”

Generally, most experts who spoke to Cointelegraph on this matter agree that the framework’s publication illustrates the government’s resolve to significantly boost its enforcement efforts on the digital assets front. While this could spell more regulatory certainty and safer adoption for the crypto industry at large, certain sectors such as blockchain analytics, which specializes in transaction tracing and works closely with law enforcement, will be benefited directly.

Amanda Wick, chief of legal affairs at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, spoke enthusiastically about the U.S. government’s commitment to lowering financial risks for crypto users. She reiterated that blockchain intelligence has already won law enforcement some important battles:

“With the help of blockchain analysis, DOJ has successfully investigated and prosecuted cases involving cryptocurrency, including charges of money laundering, drug trafficking, fraud, and more.”

Wick is convinced that the urgency of crypto-related threats will prompt authorities to allocate additional resources in order to address them.

Going forward

Above all else, the Department of Justice has laid out a comprehensive vision of response strategies for noncompliance and general illicit crypto-asset activity, notes Liat Shetret, senior advisor for crypto policy and regulation at crypto analytics and compliance firm Elliptic. She added:

“The key message boils down to the ‘how.’ How will the DoJ accomplish this? In that regard the plan is specific and clear-cut.”

Shetret then laid out the five prongs of the new law enforcement strategy: coordinating parallel enforcement actions and interagency partnerships, promoting law enforcement awareness and expertise, cooperation between federal and state authorities, increased international cooperation, and private-sector education and outreach.

Some experts also think that the DoJ’s framework can inform lawmakers’ thinking on how to go about certain novel challenges. Dean Steinbeck, chief operating officer at blockchain company Horizen Labs, commented to Cointelegraph:

“The report will clearly be used by US policy makers when enacting laws involving cryptocurrency. In particular, the report spends a lot of time examining privacy coins, or what it calls ‘Anonymity Enhanced Cryptocurrencies’ or ‘AECs.’ I wouldn’t be surprised to see Congress quoting this report in laws aimed at curtailing the use of AECs.”

Clarifying how exactly existing laws should be applied in practice, enforcement guidance normally follows legislation, but it seems that in the bizarre world of crypto, the opposite can be the case as well. At any rate, it would be a good idea for privacy coins and the crypto industry at large to start bracing themselves for both more pointed legislation and tighter enforcement in the near future.",

“It seems we will have to wait until after tomorrow when the U.S. goes to the polls before we see any further clarity,” Simon Peters, an analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote Monday in an email.

In traditional markets, Asian and European indexes rose and U.S. equity futures pointed toward a higher open after last week’s steep drop. Oil prices fell to a five-month low, while gold strengthened 0.5% to $1,888 an ounce.

Market moves

If it seemed like an unusually bullish month for bitcoin (BTC), the markets agreed.

The oldest and largest cryptocurrency surged 29% in October, the most among the CoinDesk 20 list of top digital assets.

Litecoin (LTC) was the second-best performer in the group, with a 22% return, followed by bitcoin cash (BCH) at 16%.

CoinDesk reported around the start of the month (here and here) that digital-asset analysts were turning more bullish on bitcoin. Some traders had started rotating funds into the cryptocurrency from smaller tokens like Compound’s COMP and Yearn.Finance’s YFI that surged in price earlier this year amid an explosion in popularity of “decentralized finance,” or DeFi.

“We are seeing a return to bitcoin dominance,” said Andrew Ballinger, an analyst at Wave Financial, a digital-asset-focused investment manager based in Los Angeles and London.

The renewed interest in bitcoin, now with a market capitalization of about $250 billion, coincided with new signs of growing interest in the cryptocurrency from institutional investors as well as big companies like PayPal and Square. A resurgence of the coronavirus along with a deteriorating U.S. economic outlook kindled speculation that authorities would push to provide more fiscal and monetary stimulus; that might push up bitcoin’s price, seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation.

Bitcoin’s performance also stood out versus traditional assets. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks slid 2.8% in October, and gold slipped 0.1%.

The question going forward is whether bitcoin reverts to the mean or if it gets carried up on a groundswell of investors piling into the only big trade that really seems to be working in 2020. Bitcoin is up 92% year to date, versus a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500.

The biggest losers in the CoinDesk 20 in October were Orchid (OXT), with a price decline of 25%, and 0x (ZRX), down 21%.

Bitcoin watch

Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity at press time, having failed to keep gains above a key hurdle over the weekend.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $13,450, representing a 2.3% decline on the day. Prices reached a 33-month high of $14,093 on Saturday, shrugging off the recent coronavirus-led stock market instability.

However, the move above the June 2019 high of $13,880 was short-lived. The cryptocurrency’s inability to secure a foothold in the wake of overbought readings on technical indicators seems to have disappointed chart traders and could be fueling the price pullback.

According to some analysts, the failed breakout, coupled with continued instability in traditional markets, could lead to a bigger bitcoin price drop in the short-term.

“If we consider overbought daily technicals plus failure to beat the 2019 high resistance and a risk-off backdrop, it is perfectly reasonable to anticipate the possibility for a healthy decline ahead,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

Besides, many fear the results of the election will not be immediately clear, resulting in a period of uncertainty for the markets.

All these factors considered, the possibility of bitcoin revisiting the former hurdle-turned-support of $12,500 cannot be ruled out.

That said, a price crash looks unlikely, as the cryptocurrency currently has a strong bid from institutions, trader and analyst Nick Cote told CoinDesk last week.

Tweet of the Day",2020-11-02 14:03:03+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-hongkong-regulator-idUSKBN27J07U,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will regulate all cryptocurrency trading platforms operating in the financial hub, the city’s markets watchdog said on Tuesday, changing its previous “opt in” approach.

Financial regulators around the world are still assessing whether and how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Investor protection and preventing money laundering are particular concerns.

Other financial centres in Asia such as Japan and Singapore have licensing regimes which require all cryptocurrency trading platforms to be regulated.

In contrast, while Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) launched a regulatory framework specifically for cryptocurrency trading platforms last year, this was restricted to those platforms that traded an asset officially classed as a security or future, not just tokens like bitcoin.

“This is a significant limitation, as under the current legislative framework if a platform operator is really determined to operate completely off the regulatory radar it can do so simply by ensuring that its traded crypto assets are not within the legal definition of a security,” Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, said in a speech on Tuesday.

Consequently, the Hong Kong government, today, will propose a new licensing regime today under its anti-money laundering legislation, requiring all cryptocurrency trading platforms that operate there, or target investors in the city, to apply for an SFC licence, Alder said.

Dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges operate in Hong Kong, including some of the world’s largest, though many chose not to apply for a licence under the existing regime.

The SFC has not issued a full licence to any exchange, but has agreed in principle to issue a licence to cryptocurrency firm OSL Digital Securities, a unit of Fidelity-backed BC group 0863.HK, OSL said in August.",2020-11-03 02:39:28+00:00,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/us-bank-crypto-services-proceed-crypto-48073/,"US Bank and Trust Companies Move Forward with Cryptocurrency Services

This week Avanti Bank & Trust was granted a bank charter from the Wyoming State Banking Board. According to a press release, the charter gives Avanti the same powers as national banks in its approved business lines. The press release notes that Avanti’s approved business plan includes “a tokenized U.S. dollar called Avit™*; custody services for digital assets as a ‘qualified custodian’ under the Investment Advisers Act; API-based online banking services, where customer deposits must be 100% backed by reserves; and prime services for digital assets.”

In related news, late last week a Wyoming-based trust company that provides wealth management services to high net worth individuals and family offices received a “No-Action Letter on Custody of Digital Assets and Qualified Custodian Status” from the Wyoming Division of Banking. The no-action letter gives the trust company authority to provide custodial services for digital assets, “including virtual currency and digital (tokenized) securities” under Wyoming law.

According to recent reports, the largest bank in the U.S. has said that its digital currency, JPM Coin, “is being used commercially for the first time this week by a large technology client to send payments around the world.” Late last week, the same bank reportedly issued a report noting that while bitcoin is more appropriately characterized as a “risk” asset than a “safe” asset, the “potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable.”

Cryptocurrency Debit Cards Launch in the United States and Mexico

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

This week a major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, in partnership with a major U.S. financial services firm, launched the first cryptocurrency debit card to be made available in the U.S. The crypto debit card will enable users to spend their cryptocurrency by using the debit card to make in-store and online purchases, as well as withdraw funds in U.S. dollars from ATMs. According to a press release, the crypto debit card is now available to customers in “nearly 30 countries, including the UK and across Europe,” with the first U.S. customers to be approved this winter.

In similar news from abroad, Paxful, a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace, has reportedly partnered with a Spanish bank to launch the first-ever crypto debit card to be made available to customers in Mexico. According to another recent report, “almost half of all bitcoin traded on the P2P exchange Paxful is exchanged for gift cards.” The report noted that up to $20 million worth of bitcoin is exchanged for gift cards on Paxful every week.

Earlier this month a major U.S. blockchain payments firm published its annual Blockchain in Payments Report. The report finds that blockchain payment solutions are scaling; digital assets are increasingly being considered for facilitating payments, especially when paired with blockchain technology; and industry innovators are realizing significant growth, even amid COVID-19.

Blockchain Developments in Protocols, Healthcare, Copyrights, E-Signatures, IoT

By: Jordan R. Silversmith

Last week, a major U.S. technology company announced a new partnership with a New York-based blockchain company. By way of this collaboration, the technology company, which has mostly focused its blockchain offerings on HyperLedger Fabric, will now be able to offer blockchain solutions that leverage the R3 Corda blockchain. While the two companies have been competitors in the area of permissioned enterprise blockchain, the collaboration will now allow each to offer more solutions that leverage blockchain protocols initially developed by the other company.

A recent report on the role of blockchain in the global healthcare market predicts significant growth in the use of blockchain through 2027. The market is expected to reach a valuation of USD 5,798.0 million by 2027, the report says, even taking into account the effects of the pandemic.

A new plug-in from a leading web publishing platform will now allow users to timestamp content on the Ethereum blockchain. Timestamping, which creates a unique hash for the latest version of the content added to a blockchain, provides proof that the owner of the content created it and that the content has not been tampered with. To that end, the company hopes the new plug-in will help with copyright issues.

A prominent electronic signature business recently announced its vision for how blockchain-based “smart agreements” will work. The business plans to work with a company focused on smart contracts to create a new way for e-signatures to be integrated into the blockchain framework. The goal of the functionality is to enable e-signatures to become active pieces of IT infrastructure that can communicate with external resources.

The Sovrin Community released a new white paper last week on the interaction between the “Internet of Things” (IoT) and the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI). The white paper addresses the current lack of a universal means to distinguish one “thing” from others or to determine what that thing is permitted to do. According to the white paper, this lack of identity and authority in IoT objects hampers the development of multiparty IoT services and ecosystems and makes it more difficult to provide effective solutions to the growing threat of cyberattacks. The white paper runs through several use cases and shows how SSI-enabled devices can use cryptographic methods to validate the identity of IoT objects.

Enforcement Actions Target Crypto SIM Swapping and Ponzi Schemes

By: Joanna F. Wasick

This week, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced indictments related to a plot to steal cryptocurrency and various electronic accounts, including social media accounts. The scheme allegedly involved registering fraudulent internet domains that appeared to be from legitimate wireless providers, sending “phishing” emails and taking over wireless phone numbers. The defendants are also alleged to have used electronic account credentials stolen from employees and affiliates of wireless providers to access those companies’ computer networks without authorization. The indictment states that after getting access, the defendants took over victims’ wireless accounts through “SIM swapping,” whereby customers’ mobile numbers, which are linked to unique subscriber identity modules (SIMs), were instead linked to SIMs installed in a device controlled by the defendants or their co-conspirators. Defendants then were able to access the victims’ other accounts, including email, social media and cryptocurrency accounts.

Last week, Spanish National Police arrested Santiago Fuentes, the operator of cryptocurrency arbitrage firm Arbistar 2.0 and charged him with financial fraud and money laundering. Arbistar reportedly served about 120,000 users who together invested about $520 million dollars in bitcoin into Arbistar’s trading bot. Last month, investors began accusing the platform of being fraudulent after Fuentes claimed a “computer error” disabled trading bot withdrawals and erased more than a quarter of the funds. An investigation firm tracking the case has reportedly found that Fuentes was actually running the platform as a Ponzi scheme.

“Access to reliable and affordable financial products is indispensable,” Paxful CEO and co-founder Ray Youssef said. “Whether looking to invest in education, start a business, or simply manage the financial demands of everyday life, there should be a viable option for everyone across the globe.”",2020-11-02 14:18:34+00:00,https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2020/11/02/how-will-bitcoin-trade-post-election/,"All eyes are on the US election this week, and even with only one day to go, there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding the outcome. As bitcoin hovers around its 12-month high of $14,000 there are some who feel it has further to go irrespective of whoever wins the election. Bitcoin has had a sensational year, and its price has soared in the past few months. From over $10,000 in February, it lost half its value in the March market crash, plummeting to less than $5000, but since then it’s enjoyed a steady climb. There have been fluctuations along the way, which is par-for-the-course with cryptocurrencies, but it’s now sitting above $13,500 for a single coin. So, the question is, will the US election outcome cause its bull-run to end, continue, or will it have no effect at all?

Big Names Boost Bitcoin Credibility

Some big-name market analysts and pundits have been increasingly bullish on bitcoin this year, adding to the hype. But the most significant shift in recent weeks is an acknowledgement from some dependable places, giving weight to its credibility as a viable digital asset. These established organizations include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Square Inc (NYSE: SQ) and Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL), plus lesser known business intelligence company MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: MSTR).

When bitcoin was enjoying a previous bull-run in 2017, it was en route to reach $20,000, momentarily peaking at $19,783.06 on December 17. This wasn’t to last, but interestingly at that time, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called bitcoin a fraud, threatened to fire anyone trading it and publicly ridiculed his daughter for owning it.

Just this month, however, JPMorgan has done a complete U-turn with its Global Markets Strategy group touting bitcoin as a viable alternative to gold among millennials. Even going so far as to suggest it could double or triple in value if its current trend continues. JP Morgan Chase then announced it has set up its own dedicated cryptocurrency business unit called Onyx. Dimon later stated he regretted his 2017 stance on the crypto asset.

Meanwhile, Square, which is owned by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, invested $50 million in bitcoin and PayPal said it would let its users buy a selection of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. This is particularly significant, because PayPal has close to 300 million customers, making it the equivalent of the 21st largest bank in the US.

MicroStrategy kicked off this shift in attitudes with its $250 million bitcoin purchase in August, which it has since increased to $425 million. Its CEO Michael Saylor has also personally purchased over $238 million worth of BTC holdings for the long-term.

Some have asked how much #BTC I own. I personally #hodl 17,732 BTC which I bought at $9,882 each on average. I informed MicroStrategy of these holdings before the company decided to buy #bitcoin for itself. — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) October 28, 2020

Will a Biden or Trump win change Bitcoin’s direction?

This shift in attitude has more to do with the state of the world economy and little to do with the US election. Therefore, whether Biden or Trump takes office should make little difference to bitcoin’s stratospheric path. Nevertheless, it’s likely to face volatility of some kind throughout the coming months.

If Trump wins, Biden supporters will be up in arms and some believe rioting will get a whole lot worse. If Biden wins, the same could happen from the Trump side. Either loser may be encouraged to contest the result, leading to further uncertainty in the coming weeks.

Impatiently waiting news of government stimulus

Investors globally are impatiently waiting for news of further government stimulus, to keep the economy ticking over throughout the winter months, particularly with the Christmas shopping season underway. With no announcement as yet, the S&P 500 has been wobbling, further boosting the case for bitcoin and alternative assets.

Dutch institutional investor @PlanB* is one such bitcoin bull not ready to throw in the towel. He believes if the president brings a big stimulus package in immediately after the election, this is great news for bitcoin. Trump has already stated he’ll do just that, but many speculators believe the result will be the same if Biden becomes president, because he’ll have no choice but to stimulate the economy. However, there is concern for short-term trouble ahead because if Trump loses, he’ll remain the official president until mid-January 2021, during which time he may refuse to sign the stimulus bill and therefore delay any coronavirus relief package until Biden takes office. If this scenario pans out, it would more than likely add further fuel to the bitcoin fire.

The Bitcoin Appeal

The consequences of central banks, printing an endless stream of money, is destructive, but bitcoin stands to benefit as investors diversify into the original digital asset.

As the world faces, the likelihood of inflation as one of the few ways to escape the exorbitant global debt, and as yet no solution to the raging pandemic; a self-regulating system, with no official organization in charge, is understandably gaining support. Unlike the tidal wave that took bitcoin hurtling towards $20,000 in December 2020, bitcoin is now being embraced by the established investment community rather than simply retail investors encouraging their nearest and dearest to buy, drug lords, and a tiny proportion of minor hedge funds.

Endorsed by Paul Tudor Jones

Billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has been hailing the merits of bitcoin since he began recommending it to clients in March and April as a hedge against inflation. He believes investing in the asset now is similar to investing in the early days of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)).

“I think we are in the first inning of bitcoin and it’s got a long way to go,” – Paul Tudor Jones

While he was convinced back in May, the community’s reaction to his decision has served to reinforce his confidence in bitcoin and brought him to a new level of understanding in its strength.

“what I learned was, and what I was so surprised by is that bitcoin has this enormous contingent of really, really smart and sophisticated people who believe in it.” – Paul Tudor Jones

The collective power in the backing of its global community combined with their intellectual capital has given him even more of an assured outlook on the future of bitcoin as a main player in the investment stratosphere.

Investing is Evolving

In recent years, but particularly in the wake of Covid-19, investing has rapidly evolved. Millennials and Generation Z-ers can now buy fractional shares at the click of a button from their mobile devices. They can instantly buy half a share of Tesla, while stopping for a coffee in Starbucks and trade Starbucks while in there. They can trade in and out of stocks with as little as a dollar and no fees to contend with; thanks to the rise of apps like Robinhood in the US and Trading 212 in the UK. Their digital savviness also serves them well when it comes to investing in crypto. They’re not easily daunted by it and find the reason for investing in it makes perfect sense.

Some people say bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but how different is that to gold? Gold is accepted because it has been around for so long. The size of the gold market versus the value of the bitcoin market is vast. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation equates to just 1-2% of all gold above the ground, so if the weighting was to increase to 5% of all gold, the bitcoin price would be looking more like $30,000 a coin!

Eclipsing Oil, Gold and the US Dollar

Throughout the past 75 years, the US dollar has generally been considered a reliable store of value. It’s the most widely owned fiat currency in the world and recognized as the global reserve currency of choice. Unfortunately, confidence in the dollar has been slipping in 2020. While it’s still used to denominate and settle most international trade, the political and social unrest apparent across the US is making investors nervous of its future place in the global power struggle. Even prior to Covid’s arrival the US was printing and spending money like crazy. But the pandemic took this to a prize-winning level. In the blink of an eye, the US dollar supply in circulation had increased by an astounding $3 trillion.

This stimulus is intended to kick-start the economy and keep general economic transactions under control, ensuring ordinary citizens can continue to buy groceries and their vital consumer goods. It’s not yet clear how effective this will be in filling the employment void the pandemic has created, but with no vaccine yet in circulation, concerns are mounting.

And it’s not just concerns for the US dollar, the whole world is increasing its debt and the price of oil has really been hammered by the crisis. Other commodities have so far fared well this year, but there’s still a selection of investors that believe bitcoin is the only truly viable long-term hedge against inflation.While bitcoin is unlikely to become a digital currency, there is increasing weight being given to its prospects as an alternative store of value.

Gold still has a strong investment case as a protection against inflation, but it’s simply not as scarce as bitcoin. While gold can be subject to supply shocks, bitcoin has a determined and fixed supply and mining for it doesn’t have to meet stringent environmental, ethical, social and governance rules.

In less than a decade, bitcoin has gone from being little more than a concept to having a market cap of over $200 billion. Gold already in circulation, is thought to have a global valuation of approximately $9 trillion. That’s a conservative estimate, but if bitcoin is to be compared to gold, then it’s currently undervalued by 45 times. In this scenario, bitcoin could effectively increase by 45x to $500,000 US dollars per coin. Although that seems far-fetched it’s easy to see how bitcoin still has far to run. If individual bitcoin ownership is currently around 1-2% of an investor’s portfolio, it wouldn’t take much to raise that to 5%, at which point the price of bitcoin would soar above $30,000.

If cryptocurrency ETF’s become mainstream, then that will create another crucial turning point for the asset. For ordinary investors that find the prospect of buying digital currency daunting, it would make the process simple and rapidly bring a massive influx of money from many new sources. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is already reported to be working on regulations that could pave the way to permit cryptocurrency versions of ETFs, so this is not out of the question.

While it’s unlikely that the US election result will have much bearing on the investment case for bitcoin, it will more than likely cause increased price volatility. Nevertheless, it appears bitcoin’s 2020 bull run is far from over and 2021 looks increasingly exciting too.

*According to Google, PlanB @100trillionUSD is a Dutch institutional investor with a legal and quantitative finance background.

Produced by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, the framework outlines the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increase in digital asset use, the relationship between the Department of Justice and other enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad in addressing these challenges and details the Department of Justice’s strategy for responding to them.

It makes for great reading for anyone who remains unconvinced that regulation and effective enforcement is necessary for the survival of digital assets and their mass adoption. It shows the scale of the problem, the extent to which regulation and enforcement has been able to be used to combat it, and where gaps in regulation and enforcement are currently allowing criminals running criminal platforms to enable serious crime and defraud market participants of their money.

And for those who are enabling this crime wave—whether by committing the crimes directly, running the platforms which enable crimes to be committed or as an employee of a company who is operating outside of the law—this document shows that world governments are keenly aware of you, and it’s only a matter of time until you, your platform and/or your employer become another case study.

The report

In publishing the report, the task force could almost be addressing the crypto crime cartel directly. In categorizing the key threats posed by the digital asset market, they say:

“As the Task Force has found, illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall into three categories: (1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; or (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.”

The account of criminal activity taking place using digital assets and associated technologies given by the DoJ in the report is sobering.

They point to countless instances of exchange operators allowing their platforms to be used—often openly—as a means of laundering money used in illegal transactions:

“Unlicensed or unregistered exchanges or money transmitting businesses can ‘provide an avenue of laundering for those who use digital currency for illicit purposes.’ In addition, even properly registered exchanges can serve as a haven for criminal activity by operating under lax rules or by flouting AML protocols.”

They talk about the bust of Welcome To Video, then the world’s largest child exploitation marketplace, where operators and users transacted in BTC on the belief of anonymity. They talk about the dismantling of three large-scale terrorist financing campaigns that were being enabled by digital assets; money went to al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaeda and ISIS.

Of particular focus in the publication is the crimes that are taking place within digital asset markets themselves (as distinct from using the markets as a means to a criminal end). It identifies the very real risks of theft, market manipulation and general fraud posed by rogue exchanges that have been allowed to operate in absence of a comprehensive enforcement regime:

“This susceptibility to theft on a massive scale demonstrates that the lack of appropriate regulation and monitoring of cryptocurrency exchanges poses a threat to cryptocurrency users themselves, as well as to the general public.”

And:

“Given their potential to facilitate criminal activity, these entities have a heightened responsibility to safeguard their platforms and businesses from exploitation by nefarious actors and to ensure that customer data is protected and secured.”

The report goes on to identify the key business models which are being used to facilitate crimes of many kinds:

Cryptocurrency exchanges

Peer-to-peer exchanges

Cryptocurrency kiosks

Virtual currency casinos

Anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies

Mixers and tumblers

The focus on digital assets which purport to provide anonymity as an enabler of criminal activity is encouraging, and touched upon throughout the report.

Enforcement

Unfortunately, however sobering, the report shouldn’t surprise anyone who has been paying attention. CoinGeek has reported extensively on the rampant fraud, money laundering, theft, child exploitation and drug trafficking which is currently taking place thanks to the efforts of big criminal exchanges and other crypto industry players.

Thankfully, the publication includes a comprehensive overview of the channels being used by law enforcement to hold these criminals to account. It identifies the agencies working under the mandate of the criminal code (think BitMEX’s Bank Secrecy Act indictments), regulatory authorities (FinCEN and the SEC fall into this category). It also looks at non-U.S. regulators, such as the Financial Action Task Force (who are apparently investigating Binance).

As far as enforcement goes, the publication reports that a core part of law enforcement’s strategy is to be ‘aggressive’ in its investigation and prosecution of those who use digital assets to ‘commit, facilitate or conceal’ crimes. It specifically mentions the need for U.S. law enforcement and regulators to be able to pursue people and companies which are based overseas:

“The inherently global nature of the virtual asset ecosystem poses significant investigative challenges for U.S. law enforcement agencies and for Department prosecutors. Effectively countering criminal activity involving virtual assets requires close international partnerships.”

Education is another piece of the U.S.’s strategy in this space, emphasizing the need to have law enforcement that is appropriately trained and aware of crimes which are using often complex and novel technology.

Conclusion

The thrust of the DoJ’s work in this area is summed up nicely in the closing paragraphs of the report, something which the various scam digital assets and criminal exchanges should pay close attention to (emphasis added):

“Despite the many challenges, the Department of Justice has aggressively investigated and prosecuted a range of malign actors who have used cryptocurrencies to facilitate or to conceal their illicit activities. Similarly, the Department has brought actions against individuals and companies that have failed to meet their legal obligations to counter illicit activity. In particular cases, we have even proceeded against the illicit cryptocurrency itself, seizing those virtual assets and removing them from the stream of international commerce, irrespective of our ability to identify or to apprehend the actors who used them.”

The prosecution of BitMEX’s founders and lawsuits against the likes of Binance and Bitfinex show that U.S. law enforcement will not be stopped by a corporate veil or a thinly-disguised attempt to flee the reach of regulators and prosecutors by re-establishing in overseas jurisdictions. By referring these attempts directly, and by explaining that damaging criminal activity is taking place under the guise of a variety of different business models, it would seem that the most recent slate of prosecutions and lawsuits are the first of many.

The above quote also again emphasizes that action can be taken against digital assets directly, even when the criminals behind them might be unlocatable. Agencies in the U.S. have steadily expanded the scope of their enforcement actions over the past two years, and this report references privacy-enhanced assets multiple times. One can speculate based on this that ‘privacy coins’ and similarly marketed assets will increasingly fall into the crosshairs of the DoJ and associated agencies.

Now, it’s only a question of which illegal exchange, criminal mixer or fraudulent asset peddler comes next.

Transcript

Gary Berman: Hello, and welcome to the “Cyber Hero Adventures: Defenders of the Digital Universe” show. Today’s show focuses on answering the question, “What is fact versus fiction regarding cryptocurrency?” Stay tuned to find out more.

I’m your host, Gary Berman. Our mission is to shine a light on the people and organizations who keep us safe online while at work, home, and school, and to serve as a business to business networking platform for the cybersecurity and information technology community. We’ve learned that 55 percent of human communication is nonverbal. That’s why we include a video feed, so that you have the option of seeing our guests or simply to just listen. You never know who you’re gonna connect with and how you’ll be able to maximize opportunities resulting from hearing from our guests.

As the victim of a series of cyberattacks, I’ve learned that the only time that you hear about hacking or cybersecurity is when the criminals win. Well, not anymore!

Let’s begin by saying thank you to today’s special solo guest. Paul Lee is the CISO for Uphold, a currency trading platform. He hails from Liverpool in the North of England and went to university in Leeds. Now, what I’m about to say comes directly from Paul. This is not me. And I quote, “He enjoys piña coladas and getting caught in the rain, as well as solving problems and making his users safer, whether they happen to like it or not.”

Hey, Paul—welcome to the show.

Paul Lee: Hello, Gary. Thank you for that introduction, and thank you for the disclaimer. It’s appreciated. [Laughter]

Berman: [Laughter] It’s the first time I’ve ever needed a disclaimer, but it’s pretty funny and I give you credit for that.

Lee: Well, thanks very much. [Laughter]

Berman: So, Paul, you know, our audience is about to listen and learn about what you do, but I would like to begin by asking you why you do it. You know, what is your mission? Tell us your origin story.

Lee: Okay. So, I think, potentially, your users will know a book called The Cider House Rules. There’s a—the protagonist is a guy called Homer Wells, and he’s defined in the book by needing to be useful. So, I’ve felt that need since I was pre-uni. I got into IT because of it, because that looked like it was gonna be the next big enabler, you know, the machine—I’m showing my age, now—the machine and information age, IT was just a way to get stuff done.

And then, I went from, I was an IT manager, then I managed other IT managers. In telecommunications, I went through the, there’s a big telecoms provider in the U.K. called Energis. I used to manage systems there. Then I realized that security was a new frontier. A lot of what I did and a lot of the more nebulous stuff, let’s call it the interchange between the people and the machines, it was security. That was the edge, and that was where it was most interesting to be, ultimately. And so, I could be useful and have an interesting life by going into security, and so I did that through kinda the finance angle. Private equity firms were just kinda the wild, wild West, and they used to by software to manage their portfolios, and so, I basically got in on a company that provided software portfolios, software—sorry, portfolio software. And I used to do the IT and then the security for those guys. So, I’ve dealt with regulators, banks, some governments, sovereign wealth funds, all that kinda good stuff.

And then, I loved all that, and then I got the opportunity again to do the cyber security with an IT background in crypto, which is another new frontier, so you’ve got a new frontier protecting a new frontier. It just, it was an irresistible call for me to work at Uphold, so yeah. [Laughter]

Berman: I mean, that’s a great version of the story, and it brings to mind, there is a famous kind of quote from a gentleman, I think in the 1960s or so when someone asked—he was a bank robber, a prolific bank robber, and someone asked him, you know, “Why do you rob banks?” And he famously replied, “That’s where the money is.”

Lee: [Laughter] Brilliant.

Berman: And now the money is all virtual and digital. Tell us about that.

Lee: Yeah, exactly.

Berman: Just tell us about what is cryptocurrency.

Lee: Okay, so, cryptocurrency is a digital-only representation of value. It is not a commodity, but it can be treated as one. So, it’s not a direct, you’re not buying an orange, you’re not buying a face mask in COVID times. You’re buying the value that is derived from the knowledge that this unique digital asset is unique, which isn’t true when you’re talking about the U.S. dollar, the pound, the Euro. It can be spent multiple times and it can be owned, really, by different people and that’s where inflation comes from. Whereas digital currencies initially, I mean, Satoshi’s dream was to ensure that people knew that that Bitcoin or portion of a Bitcoin that they were buying, selling, was known to be owned by one party and then sold to another.

And so, that ownership piece was really important, because it meant that the power was put back into the end user, the ultimate owner of that, and there were no brokers. His dream was that the big banks would be put—not put out of business, but kind of sidelined in this model

Berman: Indeed. And for our audience who may not be familiar with the origin story of Satoshi—and this is an interesting fact versus fiction kind of thing because there’s this entire mythology built around this man. I have looked—

Lee: We assume he’s a man.

Berman: Well, that’s the question—so, what’s the story.

Lee: So, back in, I believe it was 2003—I could be wrong—someone created an algorithm and started talking about it on forums. And the algorithm was public. Some algorithms are, they derive their security through the fact that you don’t really see the algorithm, but this algorithm was put forward. It was essentially a way of creating a unit of value, a thing.

It’s ultimately a hash on a chain. This hash is created through work—the work being a computer calculating two hash values together. It’s essentially, it’s cold work because it costs time and energy and computing power. And so, those things have real value in the real world, and so therefore, if people are spending them, the derived product, which is our Bitcoin, has value based on that, because you can’t just print them. And they use hashing functions, which is a mathematical function, which is one way, it’s a one-way hashing function. In order to derive the end value without using the hashing function or going through the work, you’re talking billions and billions and billions to one, the possibility that you would accidentally create a Bitcoin that would function correctly.

But even if you were able to do that, you wouldn’t be able to write it to the blockchain, which is ultimately the value of Satoshi’s blueprints for a currency. Because what happens is, we can trace all of the currencies and all of the related transactions between—not the currencies, sorry, Bitcoins—all of those related transactions all the way back to when the first Bitcoin was minted where someone solved the puzzle, the hash comparison, the mathematical function, and then created the first Bitcoin, we can see who owned it, it’s a Bitcoin address, so it looks a bit weird to humans, but it’s ultimately a long number. And that is the address of a wallet, and a wallet ultimately will belong to a person or an entity. And so, then, you can spend it or you can keep it. In the industry, they call it HODLing. You can hold it, but it’s called HODLing. [Laughter] So, there are people who HODL and there are people who trade

So, the idea is that that transaction is validated by other people doing transactions on the blockchain. And so, you all get a version of the blockchain, it’s a kind of voting consensus algorithm. So, if one person is trying to erroneously spend someone else’s Bitcoin or mint a Bitcoin outside the confines of the security paradigm of the currency, it will be spotted, because it won’t look correct and the hash will be wrong and other people validate that.

Now, we can talk about the types of attack that can go, that can be possible on a blockchain that don’t have so many people involved. But the more people involved, the more transactions involved, I should say, because a lot of them are machines. It’s not all people transacting, it’s a lot of automation as well. The more individual transactors on the network, the more trustable it is from a certain perspective. Because if you imagine—I’m sorry if I’m going off on one, but—

Berman: No, no, not at all. I’m really happy that you’re doing this, because it really is like layers of an onion, you know.

Lee: It is. It totally is.

Berman: And the more you kind of look into it, you know, the more there is. I remember when I was first on my kind of Forrest Gump improbable journey into cybersecurity, I went to a cryptocurrency conference.

Lee: Which one was it?

Berman: It was in Miami, where I live, a couple years ago. And there were some things that really just jumped out. Number one is, I had had—this is a fact versus fiction kind of thing—this view that cryptocurrency equals Bitcoin. That there was only one type of currency; I’ve subsequently learned about Monero. And there were 100 booths there with this entire ecosystem around the notion of cryptocurrency and I had the privilege of listening and learning from some people from the Bitcoin Foundation and things like that.

Can you take our audience, you know, peel away some of these onions about the ecosystem?

Lee: Yeah, okay. To keep it fairly high level—so, we are a trading platform. And so, we allow people to trade in multiple currencies—fiat currencies like dollar and pound and then cryptocurrencies. And then there are things called stable coins, and then there are also digital commodities.

Now, there’s different names for these things, but ultimately, you are paying for or buying the underlying value. So, people are trying to sell different underlying values. So, we trade, and lots of other platforms trade now in AU coins. So, it’s essentially gold. So, somewhere in the world, gold is owned by the people who mint the coins, the digital coins. And you are essentially buying into the fact that you will own this underlying or asset, this commodity. So, it’s like a traditional commodity, but it’s digitized. And so, you don’t have to go through a traditional broker. You are essentially trusting the person who’s issuing the currency. So, there is that.

There is what people call digital gold, which is Bitcoin. A lot of people refer to Bitcoin as digital gold, you know, it’s the progenitor of a lot of the thinking around cryptocurrency. And we’ve talked about Satoshi, you know, we can go into loads of detail about the tech of it, but ultimately, it’s the immutable blockchain that’s public, you know, that’s the thing. There’s no obfuscation. There is no prevarication about, “Oh, I’ll pay you on Tuesday, I’ll do this, blah blah blah.” If you go into a transaction, it’s there and then, and it’s validated. The reason it takes time on the blockchain is because it’s validated by your peers.

Berman: Well, let me ask you about that. Forgive the interruption, but you’re saying so many important things. So, it’s a question of time for transaction, you know, if someone were to buy something using a credit card, it’s microseconds, you know?

Lee: Yeah.

Berman: If someone—tell our audience about that. You know, what is the latency

Lee: Yeah, so the latency—I think at one point it was about 12 minutes. That’s the one that pops into my mind, but it’s waxed and waned over the years. I think the crypto guys will slap me for getting this wrong, but I think 12 minutes is what sticks in my mind. So, for a Bitcoin transaction, you get preliminary validation, but then you get—so people will validate your transaction is real, and then you’ll get the full, actual validation where the full quorum of required users or validations comes in.

And so, when you’re performing a transaction using Bitcoin, the receiver of that transaction has to decide how long they want to wait to validate the transaction. A lot of them will essentially receive the transaction—this is online—and they’ll say, so, we’re not talking in-person transactions here, which is also possible, because there’s a lot of crypto debit cards now. The receiver, the merchant, will receive the transaction and they’ll essentially validate the order and say, “Brilliant, we’ve got your payment, we’ll deliver on blah blah blah” and they’ll act in good faith.

Now, something that’s a little bit different than with credit cards, because the risk is taken on by the credit card provider, ultimately, from the merchant’s perspective. And so, if there is some kind of fraud going on, et cetera, it’s either between the merchants and the card provider, or the card provider and the end user.

Berman: Right, right.

Lee: But with Bitcoin, there’s no—it’s meant to be a point to point transaction. So, what happens is, the merchant will essentially, in good faith, continue. But then you might get an e-mail 12 minutes later and say, “Actually, something went wrong with this transaction. Please review blah” or, “We’ve noticed this” or something like that. So, that’s slightly different, but the actual [Cross talk] experience—

Berman: I understand. But just to build on that, let’s delve now into the notion of cyber security and the security of transactions. You know, because you’re a CISO and I know you are a subject matter expert on this. But going back to what I said earlier about the bank robber saying, “Okay, that’s where the money is”—do you think you’re targeted more than traditional finance organizations by organized criminals.

Lee: Well, that’s an interesting question. So—organized criminals. There is a lot of, there is a base of knowledge around how to get around, circumvent, cheat traditional finance regulations. There’s anti-money laundering regulations, there’s ways of spotting that a company is being used as a shell. There’s a lot of ways to stop it at the front door, and then there’s other ways to detect it on the back end.

We are a neonatal organization—sorry, industry compared to traditional finance. But it’s actually harder to perform most of the grifts that you can perform in a traditional bank on the blockchain, but the lack of, in the past, the lack of tying the validation of an actual human to a Bitcoin address or, sorry, a crypto address has been a problem.

So, we are currently, as an industry, catching up. Because in every area that we have regulatory ability—so, we’re given the authority to trade by the regulator. [Background noise] Whoops, sorry about that. We’re given the ability to trade in that jurisdiction. We have to do—we have to do background checks and IDVs when we are actually allowing people to trade—

Berman: So, is the industry itself self-regulated?

Lee: So, in the past, it was, predominantly, because regulators didn’t know how to deal with it. But we are definitely subject to greater scrutiny. So, that’s kinda half the answer.

So, the organized criminals—so, we are the subjective attacks, and I can go into a couple of examples in a bit, but—

Berman: Yes, can you go in—I would love to hear some examples.

Lee: Okay, so we—yeah, we do see fraud. We actually see something called friendly fraud, which is an exploit of traditional banking, which is a pain. So, ACH in the U.S., a user can spend money and then claim to their bank that it was spent erroneously. The bank will not ask the user any questions, and we as the merchant will lose that money.

And so, ultimately, what we have to do is protect ourselves using, really, a lot of AI, behavioral analysis, just various clawback methods. But it’s interesting, because we are dealing with a lot of nuanced attacks where people will be—okay, this is kind of a time when the true intelligence of these criminals comes out.

So, Donald Trump issued $1,200.00 checks to everyone—sorry, taxpayers. What happened was, we found that there were a lot of transactions, there were a lot of deposits of exactly $1,200.00.

Berman: Right, right.

Lee: We looked into that phenomenon, and then we started getting support cases of people saying, “Someone called me, talked me through registering for your application, registering on your application, and then I transferred my money.” They’d been promised that it was a federal program, and if they were to bank all of their check in this federal program, they would essentially get, you know, double their money, you know, insert random incentive here.

And what happened was, because they were on the phone with these people, watching them do all the ID verification, adding a bank account, they then stole their credentials, moved the money instantly, and then moved it again, moved it again, moved it again.

And so, what happens is, you get these poor people who’ve been scammed. Luckily, transactions can be traced and are traced, and we’ve got a fraud team and every reputable trade.

Berman: Why do you call it friendly? [Laughter] That doesn’t seem very friendly to me.

Lee: The friendly fraud aspect is the ACH fraud I mentioned earlier, because you actually have real people who are not being defrauded—I know, it is an odd name, “friendly fraud.” It’s to differentiate it from other types of fraud, because there are very, like, lots of names for those things.

Berman: I mean, this is incredibly interesting and complicated. You know, so, you know, what do you consider the biggest—

Lee: It’s tough, yeah.

Berman: – what’s the biggest challenge for you working in this industry?

Lee: Well, okay, you would expect that it’s dealing with the daily DoS attacks or DDoS attacks, you know, dealing with people pretending to be legitimate customers and actually being money mules. You know, you’d expect that it was something like that, but actually, it’s trying to find crypto engineers. So, in answer to your question—

Berman: Wow.

Lee: – in answer to your question earlier, on people who know how to, for me, talk security with regards to crypto, because there’s a dearth of knowledge about some subjects, but others, it’s just, there’s hardly any.

So, the situation is that you need to have very specialized knowledge and you need to know how to write the code or the currencies, which actually, referring back to your question, there are many, many, there’s thousands—I think, at least count, there was about 2,000 currencies that we’re kind of largely aware, yeah, that we’re largely aware of.

Berman: Wow. So, when you say currencies, you know, like Bitcoin or Monero, there are 2,000—

Lee: Cryptocurrencies, yeah.

Berman: – wow!

Lee: Yeah. Well, that—I mean, I’m sure people will scream at me saying I’m wrong even now, but that’s what I saw.

Berman: I mean, why, do you think there are more of them?

Lee: Yeah. Well, yeah, you have these initial coin offerings all the time. You get private backers who will initially fund a project and then it will go, and if a trading platform will take them on. We list, I think, 62 at the moment, but some of those—go on.

Berman: No, I mean, my brain’s just firing, you’re saying so many things.

Lee: Oh, yeah. [Laughter]

Berman: So, ICOs, you know, initial coin offerings—

Lee: Coin offerings, yeah.

Berman: – why don’t you tell our audience about that? And why are there such seemingly—let me say it this way. Is it a valid assumption that there are very large swings in the value of these coins?

Lee: Yes, yes, there are. So—

Berman: Why is—why?

Lee: Okay, so, you get initial interest—it’s related to news coverage. It’s also related to pump and dump scams, and sometimes those two are related. So, traditional schemes were, you know, time shares, other things. We have our own share of those, and so you have to go to a reputable source to figure out whether a currency is worth spending money on.

But ultimately, no matter how well people are educated, if they something—if they think they have a chance of being in on something that will be massive, they’re willing to throw a few dollars at it. And so, a lot of the speculation and a lot of the loss is to do with that.

So, usually, it’s not people losing large amounts of money on an ICO—usually. Obviously, there’s a caveat there. It’s usually transitory speculators who will put maybe 50 bucks, but you’ve got lots of them, and they’re hoping for the best. And what will happen is, someone will put a limit order on the price of—and this is getting into the trading side of it, now. We don’t actually offer trading facilities at the moment at this level, but we are working on it.

But on some platforms, you can put a limit order on it. So, you’ll say, “Okay, if the price reaches this amount, sell. If it reaches this amount, buy.” And what will happen is, they’ll put out, they’ll tell an influencer, a crypto influencer to say something. The crypt influencer may or may not know better, and they’ll be part of this and it will kind of drive interest in the currency through the roof. Then you have bought low and now, you’re gonna sell high, because you’re expecting it, you expect it to happen. So, you’ll put a limit order on it in the next 24 hours or something. You’ll make sure that it’s—

Berman: Well, I mean, to me, it’s very interesting, because the fact that it’s so secure is a double-edged sword, I think, possibly, because criminals, cyber criminals use—let me say it this way. Is it valid that cyber criminals use cryptocurrency to exchange value for illicit services?

Lee: It is, it is. But it’s also true that people use shell companies and gold transferred for, you know, certain artifacts. In any financial system, that will happen, but you’re right, people will use cryptocurrencies to exchange value.

There are tools that we use, and everyone else uses and the FBI uses and Interpol uses pretty effectively, and I’ll talk about the Twitter hack in a minute. But they will use these tools to figure out—I used to call it, when I did presentations, I would call it the six degrees of Kevin Bacon of blockchain. Because you have Bitcoin wallets—sorry, I’m saying Bitcoin—blockchain wallets and those wallets will have a transaction connected to another wallet, connected to another wallet, connected to another wallet. And through the interactions of those wallets, you can discern risk and you can discern intent a lot of times. You know, did people really mean to do this? Have we had repeated transactions?

There were some—I mean, another phrase, tumblers, there are some services that will allow you to try and wash some currency using a tumbler. So, it disaggregates the sender from the receiver, but they are more and more getting, they’re getting killed off.

Berman: Wow.

Lee: But you mentioned Monero—yeah, for obvious reasons. Regulators don’t want anything to do with them and so, they lose their license and they’re not able to trade and then it becomes an illegal activity and then they get arrested.

Berman: Yeah.

Lee: But you mentioned Monero. Monero is a privacy coin, which means that there are functions inside the coin which make it easier to conceal your identity, and it uses certain functionality that’s similar to tumbling. But it’s not generally used by commerce, there’s a lot less users out there.

And can I just quickly go back to the volatility you mentioned? So, the volatility is more likely on a platform on a coin that has less users and less invested value, because it’s easier to create a swing. A classic one is Dogecoin. I have a bit of Doge myself, but it’s just because it’s a laugh and it’s got a dog as its symbol and my son likes the doges

Berman: [Laughter]

Lee: I think it’s a Shiba Inu.

Berman: Wait, wait, before you go into that, are you suggesting that you are making your financial decisions based upon your, you know, liking of a dog?

Lee: Absolutely, absolutely, because my sons like it.

Berman: Because I’m not gonna invest in you. Maybe I’ll do a platform, but forget it. [Laughter

Lee: Absolutely. So, I’ve got a few Doge because I love the, my son loves these Shiba Inu dogs. I mean, I haven’t, I’ll ask you another—haven’t you got a Zimbabwean dollar? You know, it’s great to have some of these currencies that are just random and, you know, 1 billion Zimbabwean dollars. But sometimes it’s.

Berman: What is that worth in today’s coin?

Lee: Oh, I don’t know—.00002 cents, something.

Berman: Wow. Listen, I live in Florida. I have some great swampland I’d love to sell you if you’re interested.

Lee: Absolutely.

Berman: But more on a substantive note, here—who are your biggest users on your platform? How do you describe that?

Lee: Yeah, we’ve got a bit of a cross-section. One of the founders, a few of the founders’ principles was that people who were not served by traditional finance need a place to be able to transact

Berman: Oh. You mean, like the unbanked or the underbanked.

Lee: I was about to say, the unbanked and underbanked, yes. So, those people—so, classic example. I don’t really want to draw attention to specific countries, but there are some countries where rapid inflation, distrust in the structures, the traditional structures, and the sheer non-value and no trust in the currency has forced people to choose different ways of trying to exchange value. And we see, on our platform, from certain jurisdictions, people essentially buying loaves of bread, just their weekly groceries, petrol or gasoline. So, people are using—

Berman: Wow. Is that a debit card, is that some kind of –

Lee: No, no. What’s happening is, they’re using their phones and they’re essentially using QR codes to transfer using, you know, any given cryptocurrency to each other, and so they can see, “Oh, I’ve just paid you, I’ve got my groceries.” And so, it’s sidestepping that traditional finance role.

Berman: Interesting. Wow.

Lee: Yeah, so, there’s those people. There’s the aforementioned HODLers, people who basically grab it and hold onto it and then occasionally, they’ll see a new currency will come out and they’ll say, “Oh, I’ll just spend a little bit more on that.” But ultimately, I might want my cold storage—so, there’s hot storage and cold storage. Hot storage is something like Uphold, you are connected to the Internet and you are able to trade easily and you can do stuff. But you also are subject to the risk of someone hacking your account and doing stuff that you might not want. And then you’ve got cold storage, which usually relies on physical controls. What I particularly like is a Ledger Nano, but there’s Trezor out there as well. But you’ve got a nanodevice, you—

Berman: A physical, like a pod, or—

Lee: It’s a USB—yeah, it’s a little USB and there’s Bluetooth ones now. And you’ll plug ‘em in, you’ll use an app to transfer, to basically give you a secure Bitcoin address. You will then go to wherever you buy your Bitcoin and—let’s just say Bitcoin; cryptocurrency, but I’ll say Bitcoin.

Berman: Okay.

Lee: I seem to be going [Cross talk].

Berman: No, I mean, it’s how I began. I [Cross talk] I’ve always just called it that. But, you know, as you’re talking about the user experience, you know, how do you decide in your role as CISO between usability and security on the app?

Lee: Yeah, I know. It’s tough. It’s tough because you’re trying to make the app easy to use, you’re trying to make it as interoperable with other apps, because we have a partner program, and you’re also trying to make sure that the people who use the app are secure.

And so, there’s, on the website, there’s two sections to the security section. There’s like, us protecting you and you protecting you. And there’s always a big debate about whether 2FA, two-factor. I just have to say this, two-factor is not an e-mail address, everyone. Some people try and argue it is. It’s a disaggregated step, and so, if you’ve got e-mail to reset your password, you know, that’s not a disaggregated step, that’s you using a password combination.

So, you’re using a password, 2FA, you’ve got biometrics, you’ve got the usual slew. SMS is the most known but has some variable flaws with it. And then you’ve got TOTP, which is your Google Authenticator app, which is a little bit of a pain. You need a separate app to use it.

So, ultimately, we have to decide what to do as a baseline, you know, what we make all the users do, then we have to decide when we do that. You know, do we do it when people onboard onto the platform ad we just get the pain over with, or do we say, “You know what? We’re gonna make it easy for you to get on the platform and we’ll do it when you wanna deposit funds,” so, when money is changing hands? Or do we wait until you wanna move money, you can put your money on the platform, you can spend it inside our ecosystem, but then when you wanna move that money off, you have to authenticate yourself.

Now, there’s debates around usability versus security, fraud risk versus what’s reasonable, what regulators require, you know, the letter of the law versus the spirit of why it was written, et cetera. And so, we have to—yeah, we have to change our focus depending on what our users need. Usually what we want to do, especially now, we’re trying to support the underbanked, so we’re not talking tons of money. You know, you have lower thresholds and you’ll say, “Okay, just like voting, if you’re under a certain threshold, we don’t require that you go through a crazy IDV scheme, which is gonna require documents you may not have or to have them put you in danger in a certain jurisdiction. But above that, it’s reasonable as a provider to ask for various levels of verification, because we’re dealing with larger amounts of money and the liability is greater.

So, a risk-based approach is the answer to your question. [Laughter]

Berman: Well, that’s a great answer. And so, as we’re kind of coming to a close here—I could listen and learn from you for—

Lee: And know, and I’ve realized I’ve half started a lot of subjects

Berman: – for weeks. No, no, I would love to have you back on at some point down the road and we can continue to unpack this incredibly interesting and important change in the whole world.

So, maybe you can share with our audience a little bit about who your customers are. Are you primarily B2C, so, you target consumers, or do you have business to business transactions, or do you deal with the government or all of the above?

Lee: Okay. So, at the moment, we are what we like to call B2B2C, but we have a large B2C. We have basically direct relationships with our users, and we also are trying to ramp up the partner program that we have because, ultimately, it drives business too our platform. And what we are, fundamentally, is a wallet with rules and security and we wanna make sure as many people as possible can use that.

And so, we—yeah, I would say B2B2C is the way we’re designed, but because of that, end users using our app or the webapp or the mobile app ultimately are our customers and could be businesses themselves. So, we try and treat everyone similarly. Businesses go through a lot more verification checks, obviously, but end users similarly so. So, it is a mixture.

Berman: How do you dimensionalize Uphold? How big are you, how would you explain that, you know, with the—I guess the question beneath the question is, to convey a sense of confidence and ability?

Lee: Right, so, yeah, that’s fair enough. We—so, one of the things that conveys confidence in our platform, we were one of the first, I believe the first crypto trading platform to provide a transparency page. It’s been there since 2003, it’s still there today. It shows that we are over 100 percent capitalized. So, ultimately, we don’t multispend or allow people to multispend. That, in order to transact on the platform, you’ve got to have the money there. If we were—if something happened to our company, all of the money is all there. Other sites sometimes don’t do that. So, the capitalization is there. Your money is essentially safe. And we’ve got, I think the last time I checked, $120,000,000.00 on the platform, and that’s a mixture of traditional metals, aside from the digital metals I talked about earlier, and then we’ve got the fiat currencies and all those cryptocurrencies I mentioned.

We’ve been around for a long time. We—you know, in this space, they say a long time, you know, two years is an eternity in crypto.

Berman: Right.

Lee: But we’re known, we’ve got a good presence, we take as good as we get in the Twittersphere in terms of when people say that we’re doing something wrong, we take it on board. We’ve got a good Trustpilot score. I don’t know if people are unaware what Trustpilot is, it’s an independent agency that allows users, anyone, to complain about an entity, and the entity then has a right to reply. I happen to know that our COO and President takes an active interest in these replies. And so, we’re there to make sure that people aren’t upset and aren’t causing a Twitter storm, because we make sure that we respond and we fix things that are broken

Berman: Wow.

Lee: And a lot of times, you know, fraudsters will take advantage of that, because they’ll claim that something has happened to them in order to try and force us to overlook or maybe just kind of rush into rectifying them when they have actually caused some problems for either other users or us as a platform. And so, it’s a tightrope. You know, we invest heavily in the people on the anti-fraud side, and we’ve got a decent support tea

So, I don’t know. I’d say that the Twitter, @UpholdInc is our Twitter handle, and if you just tune into that handle, you’ll see how people talk about us and to us.

Berman: Wow. Well, this has been so incredible. Let’s do a series of shows, maybe you can invite some of your colleagues, some of the thought leaders in your industry, you know, to share their insights to really help answer the question—cryptocurrency, you know, fact or fiction?

Is there anything else that you’d like to add to amplify your mission?

Lee: I just think that people need to try this out as an industry. There is a lot of—there’s a lot of problems associated in the press with it. Like, I was gonna mention the Twitter hack—we actually have seen that the FBI has found the people who hacked Twitter based on tracking where the money went when people fell for it

Berman: Oh

Lee: They made—how much did they make? I think it was only like $12,000.00. It was peanuts compared to what they could’ve made

Berman: Wow.

Lee: But ultimately, they could tie back the entire hack, which, the hack was sophisticated. The method of extracting value from the hack was very unsophisticated and so, that bit them. And so, the FBI they’ve basically found who did it now, or they’ve found suspects, shall we say.

Berman: Wow, yeah

Lee: And so, there is an entire cottage industry that’s grown around detecting fraud and detecting bad behavior. And I think it’s actually gonna be much better and cleaner than traditional finance, because traditional finance relies—if you wanna subvert traditional finance, it relies on bribery, it relies on contacts. But we’re, everything is tied to private keys, which are protected and more verifiable than your bank manager’s background. I think it’s a good way forward, and it’s shaking up the entire industry, you can see it, financially.

Berman: Wow, function. Wow. Well, Paul, thank you so much. I have, since you mentioned your dog, you know, reference and how motivating it was, and you know that I’m in the comic creation and animation business amongst other things—so, who is your favorite superhero and why?

Lee: Ah. Alright, okay, it has to be Thor, because he’s got a bloody big hammer.

Berman: [Laughter]

Lee: There ya go.

Berman: Indeed. Well, you know, on that note, for more information, we’ll include Paul’s contact information in the show notes and Paul, thanks so much for this incredible show.

If you would like to be a guest on our show, just send an e-mail to gary@cyberheroescomics.com. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Bitcoin’s price did not react at all to the 2016 election, rising a scant 1.8% in the 24-hour trading period. Given the crypto industry’s overall lack of engagement in this election, there’s no reason to believe this might change in 2020.

Of course, it is worth noting bitcoin embarked on the famous 2017 bull run just months after the election, rising to all-time highs close to $20,000 within a year and giving birth to an initial coin offering boom that regulators are still investigating and conducting enforcement actions against nearly three years later. At the moment, bitcoin is slowly rising, hitting a nearly two-year high of $14,000 just the other day. And since the last election, its price has grown 19-fold.

Still, comparing the crypto industry now to the industry in 2016 would be foolish at best. The market has matured in many ways, with the U.S. space at least seeing the introduction of futures contracts and a greater number of regulated entities. Regulators have likewise gained a better understanding of the space, introducing new regulations or clarifying how cryptocurrencies fit into existing frameworks – to an extent.",2020-11-04 01:20:13+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2020-us-election-races-crypto-230718831.html,"CoinDesk is monitoring the U.S. election, following candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives in addition to the Presidency.

President

Donald Trump (R) – U.S. President Donald Trump, first elected in 2016, has only commented publicly on cryptocurrencies once, tweeting in July 2019 that he was “not a fan” of bitcoin a month after Facebook unveiled the Libra project. Trump has nominated a number of federal regulators relevant to the crypto space, including CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, as well as Attorney General William Barr, who has publicly opposed encryption and announced a report criticizing privacy coins and privacy-enhancing tools like bitcoin mixers.

Joe Biden (D) – Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has not commented on cryptocurrencies during his push for the presidency, although his campaign joked it was not accepting bitcoin after his account was compromised during the 2020 Twitter hack. Potential Biden appointees reportedly include Boston Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who oversees the central bank branch’s work on digital dollar research. Biden hasn’t discussed encryption during the campaign, but he played a seminal role in the original Crypto Wars; as a Senator in the early 1990s, Biden proposed legislation that would have effectively banned encryption, spurring Phil Zimmerman to create the Pretty Good Privacy software for encrypting email.

Jo Jorgensen (L) – Jo Jorgensen, a senior lecturer at Clemson University, is a proponent of free market health care and replacing social security. She’s said multiple times on Twitter that she is a fan of the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin adherents trend libertarian so maybe they’re also a fan of hers.

Story continues

Brock Pierce (I) – Brock Pierce, known for his work as a child actor in “The Mighty Ducks” as well as his effort to create a crypto-friendly community in Puerto Rico, is running as an independent candidate. Pierce co-founded Realcoin, which eventually became the tether stablecoin. He later was a co-founder of Block.One, the company behind the EOS blockchain.

Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) – Lummis, who served in the House between 2009 and 2017, first invested in bitcoin in 2013 and has said she is impressed by bitcoin as a store-of-value. She won her primary race to join the U.S. Senate representing Wyoming, and is expected to win her seat easily. With a crypto-friendly banking law tapped by Kraken and Avanti Financial, Wyoming’s state government has taken the lead on crypto assets in recent months.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) – Cotton chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s economic policy subcommittee and has advocated for a digital dollar and the modernization of a dollar, saying it needs to be better than bitcoin. Previously, Cotton has made remarks supporting the scrutiny and regulation of cryptocurrencies in light of concerns about their use in illicit activities, as well as concerns that Facebook is trying to use Libra to enter into new markets. He is one of the co-sponsors of the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, which would require encrypted communication systems to include backdoor access for enforcement agencies.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) – Warner has expressed concerns about Libra, writing to its governing body last year to discourage the Chinese yuan from being included in the fiat basket underlying the cryptocurrency. The Senate Banking Committee member has also suggested that Facebook might use its user base to rapidly scale up Libra when it launches.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) – Rounds was the first U.S. senator to embrace the Libra stablecoin project, praising the initiative in an open letter sent to Anchorage, one of the Libra Association’s members last year (notably, Anchorage is based in South Dakota). He contrasted Libra with FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s planned real-time payments system. He has also praised the South Dakota Division of Banking’s decision to grant Anchorage a trust charter.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) – Graham is one of the co-sponsors of the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, which would require encrypted communication systems to include backdoor access for enforcement agencies. He has also overseen a hearing on the impact cryptocurrencies may have had on U.S. elections, specifically looking at foreign interference concerns.

Other Senate races

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) – Blackburn is one of the co-sponsors of the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, which would require encrypted communication systems to include backdoor access for enforcement agencies.

Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) – As a congresswoman in the U.S. House of Representatives, McSally proposed using a blockchain to store and share information about endemic diseases. She was first elected to the Senate in 2018.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) – The former CEO of crypto derivatives and warehouse provider Bakkt has not mentioned bitcoin since being appointed to the U.S. Senate by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) late last year.

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) – Perdue co-sponsored a bill calling for tighter sanctions on the petro, Venezuela’s central bank digital currency, among other relief efforts for migrants from the country.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) – Durbin co-sponsored a bill calling for tighter sanctions on the petro, Venezuela’s central bank digital currency, among other relief efforts for migrants from the country.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) – Markey has called on the Trump administration to take stronger action against North Korea, claiming a lack of cybercrime provisions in sanctions on the country “do nothing to restrict North Korea’s ability to steal cryptocurrencies.” He has also called on the Federal Communications Commission to take action against SIM swappers, who often steal cryptocurrencies from their victims after hijacking their phones.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) – Cornyn co-sponsored a bill calling for tighter sanctions on the petro, Venezuela’s central bank digital currency, among other relief efforts for migrants from the country.

Top 10 House of Representatives races to watch

Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) – A first-term congressman, Budd has co-sponsored a few bills to provide regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies in the U.S. (alongside Democrat Darren Soto of Florida), including the Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2018. He’s also sought to clarify crypto taxation laws, introducing a bill to prevent double-taxation on crypto transactions. Last year, he also wrote a letter with Coin Center asking SEC Chair Jay Clayton to say whether he agreed with a division head that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was not a security.

Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) – A first-term congressman, Davidson is a firm proponent of cryptocurrencies and creating regulatory clarity for the space through legislative action. He has sponsored the Token Taxonomy Act at least twice (with Rep. Soto) in the hopes of amending U.S. securities laws to create clear buckets for cryptocurrencies.

Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) – A third-term congressman, Emmer is a co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. He introduced a bill aimed at encouraging innovation by creating safe harbor for blockchain startups. Emmer also twice introduced a bill that would benefit taxpayers holding crypto. His latest bipartisan bill on securities clarity seeks to classify tokens as commodities.

Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) – A fifth-term congressman, Foster is co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Along with Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), Foster urged the Federal Reserve to consider the creation of a central bank digital currency in a 2019 letter to Chairman Jerome Powell. The same year, Foster was among the lawmakers who called for clarity on crypto taxation. In the past he’s advocated for creating secure digital identity tools and predicted in 2018 that a central bank issuing its own cryptocurrency could impact the U.S. dollar’s status as a global reserve currency.

Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) – A third-term congressman, Hill wrote a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) asking the government to consider a national digital currency. He is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. In a video interview with Yahoo Finance, Hill stated that blockchain tech is part of the future.

Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) – A longtime congressman from Massachusetts, Lynch has participated in a number of pro-blockchain initiatives in the House of Representatives over the past few years, including heading up a FinTech Task Force established by the Financial Services Committee. He’s also called on the White House to consider using blockchain tools to support COVID-19 relief efforts.

Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) – Schweikert has been an active proponent of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., introducing a number of bills to regulate cryptocurrencies and acting as one of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus’s co-chairs. Just last month, he reintroduced a bill with Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) that would let smart contracts and other information stored on a blockchain act as legal records. He’s also attempted to create a de minimus exemption for small payments conducted using cryptocurrency, a position many crypto advocates and lobbyists have called for.

Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) – A longtime representative from California, Sherman has made his anti-crypto stance clear over the past few years, going so far as to call for a complete ban on cryptocurrencies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing. More recently, during a hearing over the Libra project, he said the stablecoin project would be a “godsend” to criminals and touted the dollar’s role in enforcing sanctions.

Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) – Soto introduced two bills on digital taxonomy and blockchain innovation that passed the House of Representatives, and were incorporated into the Consumer Safety Technology Act (H.R. 8128). Soto has also introduced two amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that could boost the use of blockchain tech in the U.S. military, which were unanimously passed by the House.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) – The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee has called a number of hearings around crypto and blockchain, including several after Facebook unveiled the Libra initiative. She’s said in public statements that private crypto projects like Libra cannot be allowed to compete with the U.S. dollar, and has called for a complete halt in development until lawmakers and regulators can get a better grasp of the project and how it might be regulated.

Other House of Representatives races

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) – A second-term congressman, Gaetz is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. In 2020, along with other members of the caucus, he signed a letter addressed to President Trump asking the administration to use blockchain technology to streamline pandemic relief efforts. Gaetz also signed a 2019 letter asking the IRS to clarify tax rules as they apply to crypto assets.

Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) – A first-term congressman, Garcia introduced the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act in 2019 with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The bill called on the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve to put together a report on the implications of digital currencies which it defined as a form of exchange and store of value but not “real currency” or “real money.”

Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) – A former state senator, Garcia has not taken an overly active role in calling for crypto regulation, but introduced a bill that would classify stablecoins as securities after a House Financial Services Committee hearing about Libra last fall. She later modified the proposed text to specify the “securities” designation would only apply to “managed stablecoins,” referring to those backed by a basket of fiat currencies that are actively managed by a governing entity. In her view, Libra’s subsequent revamp was insufficient to address regulatory concerns.

Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) – A first-year congressman from Ohio, Gonzalez has participated in a few hearings around blockchain technology, asking an infosec executive whether the U.S. had the ability to shut down anonymity-enhancing tools like Dark Wallet. He has also sponsored a bill empowering the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to study whether blockchain and other new technologies might be useful for the agency’s data collection and analysis efforts.

Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas) – A first-term congressman, Gooden was among the lawmakers that called for the IRS to clarify tax laws as they apply to crypto assets, airdrops and forks in 2019. Gooden and Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) introduced the Managed Stablecoins are Securities Act of 2019, aimed at classifying actively-managed stablecoins like the Facebook-sponsored Libra as securities and establishing oversight under existing securities laws.

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) – A fourth-term congressman, Gosar introduced the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020, which was referred to the Committee on Financial Services. The draft bill asked to clarify which federal agencies regulate digital assets, and to require those agencies to notify the public of any licenses, certifications or registration requirements. The bill was not considered by the committee.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) – A second-term congressman, Gottheimer co-sponsored the Token Taxonomy Act – which would exempt tokens from U.S. securities law. It was reintroduced to Congress in 2019, after it did not leave committee in 2018. He is a member of the House Financial Services Committee’s Fintech Task Force, and was among the group of lawmakers who signed a bipartisan letter to Trump adviser Larry Kudlow asking him to include blockchain in the administration’s initiatives for emerging technologies.

Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) – A sixth-term congressman, Guthrie introduced the Blockchain Promotion Act of 2018 with Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.). The bill called for the creation of a working group to study the technology, and create a common definition for government purposes. In 2020, the congressman introduced HB6938, a bill to survey the prevalence of blockchain technology across industries and governments globally, with the goal of setting up a national blockchain strategy.

Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) – A second-term congressman, Hollingsworth signed a bipartisan letter to Trump adviser Larry Kudlow urging the administration to include blockchain in its initiatives for emerging technologies. Along with other lawmakers, Hollingsworth held a briefing with financial regulators to discuss how machine learning and AI can reduce money laundering and terrorist financing.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) – A first-term Congresswoman, Jayapal co-sponsored a stimulus bill with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) that would create a “Digital Dollar Account Wallet” accessible to every U.S. resident and granting them access to financial services. The chief idea is to use this system to issue $2,000 per month to each resident, backing the funds by minting a pair of $1 trillion coins. Jayapal is also a member of the House antitrust subcommittee, and told CNBC earlier this month that new bills targeting Big Tech monopolies could be introduced next year.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) – A second-term congressman, Khanna is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. He was among the 11 lawmakers that signed a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consider blockchain technology for streamlining the distribution of funds and supplies to those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also signed a letter addressed to the federal government, urging the administration to use blockchain solutions in pandemic relief efforts.

Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.) – Maloney, a second-term Congressman, has introduced legislation to provide some clarity around how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission collects information about digital commodities contracts and swaps. At the time, he said it was the first crypto derivative-specific legislation to make it out of committee.

Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) – A fourth-term congresswoman, Matsui introduced the Blockchain Promotion Act of 2018 with Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), aimed at defining blockchain technology by creating a working group to research the space. She also co-introduced the Blockchain Innovation Act, calling for a report on the state of blockchain technology in consumer protection and other areas. At a 2018 congressional committee hearing, Matsui asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to explain the potential applications of blockchain.

Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) – A first-term congressman, McAdams signed a 2020 letter to the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, calling for the department to use blockchain technology to streamline pandemic relief efforts. He also signed a similar letter addressed to President Trump and federal officials months later. He is a member of the House Financial Services Committee’s fintech task force. McAdams has been critical of Facebook in the past, arguing that Libra might enable child exploitation by protecting predators.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) – Running for his fifth term in Congress, McHenry is the Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees much of the crypto space. He’s warned against regulating the nascent space too heavily, saying there’s “a great opportunity around this technology.” However, he’s also raised concerns with certain projects, calling for a hearing around Libra as soon as it was announced last June.

Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.) – A seventh-term congressman, McNerney signed a 2020 letter to the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, calling for the department to use blockchain technology to aid pandemic relief efforts and the distribution of relief funds. He also signed a letter to President Donald Trump, explaining the benefits of blockchain in streamlining administrative processes.

Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) –A third-term congressman, Rice introduced the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual Currencies Act in 2019. The bipartisan bill passed the house, and requires the department of homeland security (DHS) to develop a threat assessment report on virtual currency use by terrorist organizations. The bill was co-sponsored by Reps. Peter King (R-N.Y.), Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas).

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) – A fourth-term congressman, Swalwell accepted bitcoin for his 2020 presidential bid and signed a letter urging the IRS to clarify tax laws as they apply to crypto for a second time. He has been quoted saying, “Blockchain can change the world, if we let it.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) – A first-term congresswoman, Tlaib co-sponsored a stimulus bill with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) that would create a “Digital Dollar Account Wallet” accessible to every U.S. resident and granting them access to financial services. The chief idea is to use this system to issue $2,000 per month to each resident, backing the funds by minting a pair of $1 trillion coins. Tlaib has also overseen certain House Financial Services Committee hearings around the crypto space.

Timeline of exchange FUD in the past month

On Oct. 16, top Bitcoin futures exchange OKEx suspended withdrawals after one of its private key holders was reportedly arrested.

A mere 17 days later, speculation emerged that Huobi, a Singapore-based exchange with an office in Hong Kong, might face regulatory pressure after data showed massive Bitcoin and Tether withdrawals on Nov. 2.

However, Huobi Global reaffirmed that the exchange is operating normally, and deposits and withdrawals are “operating as expected.”

Today, Reuters reported that Hong Kong regulators will propose all cryptocurrency exchanges be regulated and apply for a Securities and Futures Commission, or SFC, license as opposed to the previous opt-in approach, which many exchanges declined to do.

It comes a year after the Hong Kong government released rules for cryptocurrency exchanges. Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, said on Nov. 3:

“This is a significant limitation, as under the current legislative framework if a platform operator is really determined to operate completely off the regulatory radar it can do so simply by ensuring that its traded crypto assets are not within the legal definition of a security.”

“We can declare Bitcoin’s honeymoon phase to be over”

Despite the subtle wording of the SFC’s statement, industry experts said it is essentially a declaration to end Bitcoin’s honeymoon phase. Leo Weese, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said:

“With rumors of more crypto exchange officials arrested in China and Hong Kong’s move to make trading illegal (aka licensed), we can declare Bitcoin’s honeymoon phase to be over. If you think Bitcoin will catch on, buy it now while you still can.”

Kelvin Koh, a partner at the Asia-based cryptocurrency investment firm Spartan Group, said the timing is not a coincidence. It comes after the pilot launch of China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payment system, which has already processed over four million transactions. He explained:

“The timing of the Chinese OTC and exchange crackdowns is no coincidence. The PRC government is sending a strong message about its stance on cryptocurrencies other than the DCEP.”

Where does BTC go next?

Bitcoin price has reacted with a minor price drop, falling from $14,100 at the month’s peak to below $13,500. Albeit the reaction has been minimal, a further drop could have negative implications for the short-term trend of BTC.

Technically, the short-term support of Bitcoin is at $13,300. Below it, there is the $12,900 support area and the $12,200 level, which is the five-day moving average on the monthly chart.

On Nov. 2, before the drop of Bitcoin occurred, full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Michael van de Poppe said the $12,700 to $12,900 range is a strong short-term support area. He said:

“Still trending upwards, but lacking strength by a bit here. Has to hold above $13,550–13,650 for support. If that’s holding, renewed tests of $14,000 on the horizon. Losing and I’ll target $12,700–12,900.”

So far, the response of Bitcoin to the regulatory crackdown rumors has been minor. If BTC can remain above $13,000 in the short term, the outlook would likely stay positive.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-crypto-law-regulation/,"Hong Kong Amends Crypto Law to Regulate All Exchanges

Cryptocurrency regulation in Hong Kong is undergoing changes. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is reportedly introducing a new licensing system to regulate all crypto exchanges operating in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong’s New Crypto Regulation

The CEO of the SFC, Ashley Alder, talked about implementing a new cryptocurrency regulatory framework at Hong Kong Fintech Week on Tuesday.

All cryptocurrency trading platforms operating in Hong Kong or targeting local investors will be required to apply for a license with the SFC, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reported. “Later today, the government will propose a new licensing regime under the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance for platforms which trade any type of crypto asset even if not classified as securities,” Alder was quoted as saying.

The SFC introduced an opt-in regulatory framework for crypto exchanges in November last year. However, it only applies to platforms that offer at least one cryptocurrency that falls under the legal definition of securities.

Alder noted that the current regulatory system has serious limitations, making it possible for some trading platforms to operate away from the purview of the regulator. “If a platform operator is really determined to remain completely off the regulatory radar, it can do so simply by ensuring that its traded crypto assets are not within the legal definition of a security,” he explained.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges operate in Hong Kong but they choose not to apply for a license, which is possible under the current system. According to Reuters, the SFC has not issued a full license to any exchange to date, but it has agreed in principle to issue a license to OSL Digital Securities, a cryptocurrency arm of Fidelity-backed BC group. Alder elaborated:

Once this new regime is in place, all virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong would be regulated, supervised and monitored.

The SFC implemented regulatory guidance in 2019 that sought to treat digital asset firms trading at least one security token under the same rules as securities brokerages, but signing up with the regulator was voluntary.

If serious breaches are committed on the platforms, such as market manipulation, “there will be intervention and restriction on their business,” according to Chiu.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin’s 16% mining difficulty drop on Nov. 3 was the second-largest in history.

Mining difficulty drops are the network’s way of compensating for a low hashrate among other factors.

The drop has not had a noticeable impact on BTC price action.

Share this article

Only the minority of Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjustments are ever negative, and only 2% are double-digit drops as seen today.

Bitcoin’s Historic Mining Drop

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts automatically every 2,016 blocks, which typically takes about 14 days. The difficulty rises and falls based on increases or decreases in hashrate, the metric used to measure mining activity on the network.

This latest drop resulted from the rainy season in Sichuan province, China’s biggest hydroelectric power producer. Sichuan produces more cheap energy at this time of year, prompting Bitcoin miners to go offline to relocate temporarily.

Speaking exclusively to Crypto Briefing, CoinMetrics analyst Karim Helmy stated that the difficulty drop indicates that the network is working as intended.

“Among miners, this is viewed as a positive because nobody likes high difficulty, and the general perception is that this dip is temporary as miners migrate from Szechuan to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,” said Helmy.



The drop in hashrate resulted in longer block times, and the adjustment period took 16 days and 18 hours, 19.2% longer than usual, according to CoinMetrics. This was the longest difficulty adjustment period since October 2011, which accounts for the large drop in difficulty.

We just observed the 2nd largest negative #Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment in history: -16% It topped the -15.9% change in March this year. The only other time difficulty saw a larger downwards adjustment (-18%) was over 9 years ago, in Oct 2011.https://t.co/hXl4n3DAYR pic.twitter.com/7zgwMjNj13 — glassnode (@glassnode) November 3, 2020

Today’s difficulty adjustment was slightly greater than the 15.9% drop seen in March 2020. The largest drop occurred in November 2011. At that time, mining difficulty fell a whopping 18%.

How Does Mining Difficulty Affect Users?

A negative Bitcoin difficulty adjustment results in discounted fees and shorter block times. The size of unmined transactions in Bitcoin’s mempool will also decrease. For comparison, Bitcoin fees saw a major 350% spike in October and remain above average at writing.

Mining difficulty rose 15.54% from the end of September to the beginning of November before the sudden drop recorded earlier today.

Difficulty adjustments do not necessarily affect prices. Bitcoin price has remained relatively stable following the latest adjustment, last trading at approximately $13,736.

“I don’t think this will tangibly impact price,” Helmy told Crypto Briefing. “The US election is a much more significant ongoing event that actually reveals new information, unlike the difficulty adjustment which is just a protocol-mandated process.”

However, the hashrate will likely increase as more miners flock to the network to take advantage of the lower difficulty.

This is a key incentive of the Bitcoin network often praised for its effectiveness, as the network compensates to create an ideal environment for mining and using Bitcoin.

But ZenGo is a non-custodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your crypto assets.

When you leave your crypto assets on an exchange, somebody could log in to your account and send your assets to other wallets. Sure, there are some security features, such as email validation and two-factor authentication, but you’re essentially relying on the security team of your favorite exchange.

ZenGo and other non-custodial wallets put you in charge of security. You’re acting as your own crypto bank. It makes it more complicated to create a debit card as ZenGo can’t send and convert cryptocurrencies for you.

ZenGo is joining Visa’s Fintech Fast Track program with the intention to release its payment card in early 2021. While the card will initially launch in the U.S. only, the startup already plans to release it in other countries.

As ZenGo has no idea what cryptocurrencies you own, you’ll have to convert your crypto to USD first. In the mobile app, you’ll be able to convert some funds to fiat (such as USD) and deposit that amount on your card. If you plan to use your card regularly, you’ll be able to convert a fixed amount every week.

Compared to other crypto-powered cards, there’s an additional conversion step. “The issue if you do it automatically like Coinbase is that you can’t pick which crypto you want to use for spending. They decide for you or they force you to make a choice once for all your transactions,” ZenGo co-founder and CEO Ouriel Ohayon told me.

Additionally, anything that remains in your ZenGo wallet can’t be used with your card. Even if your card is compromised, your crypto assets remain safe.

ZenGo already lets you acquire cryptocurrencies in the app through partnerships with MoonPay and Coinmama. Thanks to the debit card, the startup will have both on-ramps and off-ramps with support for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions.",2020-11-03 00:00:00,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-at-709-a-snapshot-of-top-cryptocurrencies-from-2016-u-s-elections/,"It goes without saying that a lot has happened over the past four years when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

We went through the market’s most parabolic cycle in 2017 and a prolonged bear market in 2018.

In 2020, the market is arguably in a bullish state coming into this year’s US Presidential Elections, where Donald Trump will battle to keep his presidency against Joe Biden. At times like these, it’s worth taking a step back and see how the market looked during the previous elections that took place in 2016.

Top Cryptocurrency Prices in 2016 and Their Growth

Naturally, the first cryptocurrency to consider when drawing a comparison between the prices back in 2016 and now is bitcoin.

BTC went from $709.85 on November 8th, 2016, to its current trading price of around $13,544 for a total ROI of about 1,802%. To put it in perspective, that’s an increase of about 19x, and putting $100 in BTC back then would mean that you have over $1,900 right now.

Ethereum is clearly the leading cryptocurrency in this regard. ETH was trading at $10.83 back on that day, and it marks a surge of more than 3,390%. Ripple’s XRP, Litecoin, and Monero are also in the four-digit territory, as seen in the chart below.

Bitcoin’s total market cap back then was around $79 million, while ETH boasted a capitalization of just above $6 million – a far cry from the numbers today.

That’s how the rest of the leading cryptocurrencies looked back then:

It’s Not Just a Matter of Returns

Seeing big flashy green numbers in the portfolio is undoubtedly satisfying, but the growth of the industry is measured by factors much greater than just returns.

In 2020 there are two companies that have received official banking licenses in the US. The first one was Kraken, and the second one was the Bitcoin-friendly Avanti.

The world’s largest online payment processor, PayPal, has officially announced its support for cryptocurrencies. Customers will soon be able to buy, sell, and store their crypto directly into PayPal’s wallets. The company will also work to facilitate the incorporation of cryptocurrency in its network consisting of millions of merchants.

Major Names in Bitcoin

Another thing to consider is the fact that more and more companies are venturing in the field. This became particularly evident throughout the past few months when public companies bought bitcoin as part of their reserve balance.

MicroStrategy was the first NASDAQ-listed company to stand out as it bought almost half a billion worth of BTC in a few months. Jack Dorsey’s Square followed suit, and it bought $50 million worth of the cryptocurrency.

But that’s not all. Major institutional investors such as Michael Novogratz, Paul Tudor Jones, Chamath Palihapitiya, to name a few, have also outlined the merits of Bitcoin on numerous occasions.

In any case, it’s safe to say that we’ve come a long way in the past four years, making the next four even more interesting to follow.",2020-11-03 10:55:50+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/institutional-interest-soars-grayscale-bitcoin-fund-sees-largest-ever-weekly-inflow/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Grayscale Investments LLC offers accredited investors the opportunity to invest in digital currencies via share indices backed by digital assets.

GBTC shares represent Bitcoin holdings in the trust fund. The trust adds Bitcoin equivalent to the share value issued by the investment fund.

Last week, GBTC added 15,907 Bitcoins worth $215 million, reporting a consistent rise in the number of shares issued. The total GBTC now under management (AUM) is $6.41 billion.

Apart from Bitcoin, the firm also offers investment in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, XRP, Stellar Lumens, and Horizen.

Grayscale’s Ethereum fund (ETHE) has also shown a linear rise in investment since April 2020. The fund added 75,419 ETH worth $28.5M to its treasury yesterday, extending ETHE AUM to $914.9M.

Ethereum leads other altcoins with 12% of the total AUM—GBTC accounts for 86.6%.

Given that investment in Grayscale’s product is only limited to accredited investors, the rising GBTC and ETHE shares indicate positive institutional inflow.

Bitcoin leaped as much as 3.9% on Wednesday as volatility fueled by US elections lifted popular cryptocurrencies.

The rally pushed the most popular digital token as high as $14,257.53 before it slightly paired those gains in the afternoon. It's the highest levels for bitcoin since January 2018, when bitcoin tumbled from its record high of nearly $20,000.

Risk assets surged in Wednesday trading as expectations for a Blue Wave quickly gave way to the likelihood of a divided government. While the lack of a Democratic sweep sets up Congress for a prolonged stimulus deadlock, it also allays Wall Street's fears of a corporate tax hike. Tech stocks soared, while financial and industrial names lagged the market.

Ethereum, the next largest cryptocurrency by market cap, jumped as much as 6.8% in the session, while Ripple's XRP edged higher yet ultimately remained fluctuating near the same prices as 24 hours prior.

Mystery surrounds this suspicious transaction and the party who finally managed to cash out the big fat amount.

Was it the owner themselves, or did someone crack this wallet?

Bitcoins withdrawn from wallet in a day

As can be observed below, the Bitcoin wallet, identified by address 1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx has had a major transaction around this Election Day.

On November 3rd, 2020 it had contained 69369.16628020 Bitcoins, which is roughly equal to $957 million.

Blockchain transaction history shows the Bitcoin wallet had over 69,369 BTC

Overnight, the wallet balance mysteriously fell to a mere $1.38 after an entity cashed out the huge amount.

Provided the somewhat anonymous nature of blockchain transactions, it is hard to know just yet who is the beneficiary of this sum of money.

USD equivalent amounts: wallet balance drops to $1.38 overnight

The incident was reported by Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of Hudson Rock.

On seeing the astonishing transaction, Gal tweeted:

""UNBELIEVABLE - Someone was able to crack the password of the Bitcoin wallet I reported on only a short time ago and spend the $1,000,000,000 that was inside it!""

Wallet circulating among hackers since 2015

This wallet draws attention particularly due to its association with hackers.

Gal had been keeping tabs on this Bitcoin address since at least September this year, without successfully cracking it:

""Get this - there is a Bitcoin wallet with 69,000 Bitcoins ($693,207,618) that is being passed around between hackers/crackers for the past 2 years for the purpose of cracking the password, no success so far,"" Gal had earlier said.

""I have the wallet, @Google hook me up with a quantum computer please.""

Gal suspects the outgoing transaction was made by either the original owner of the wallet as a response to the recent publicity generated by the wallet or by someone who has managed to crack its password.

According to Gal, the wallet had been ""dormant"" since 2015, with regards to debit transactions.

A single billion-dollar debit transaction from an otherwise dormant account does look suspicious and raises red flags.

In June 2020, another Bitcoin wallet with a billion-dollar valuation had been inexplicably emptied.

While transactions made on the Bitcoin ledger are publicly visible, some level of anonymity granted to cryptocurrency users makes the money harder to track.

Following the money trail, however, is possible even with cryptocurrency and may, in turn, reveal to financial and regulatory authorities any instances of illicit activities such as money laundering which may occur.

The analyst known in the industry as Crypto Michaël tells his 82,000 Twitter followers that he sees Bitcoin likely breaching resistance of $14,000 if it can hold above $13,678.

“Interesting bounce here and back into [the] resistance zone. Breaking this and we’ll go for the highs above $14,000.

Volatility is high and probably will remain high with the elections coming up.”

As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe says the ETH/BTC pair is poised to carve out a bottom after hitting a key resistance level in September.

“Rejected at range resistance at 0.038 and it is now trying to establish support at the range low which is between 0.024 and 0.026.”

Although ETH/BTC may bottom out at support of 0.024, Van de Poppe does not expect the pair to immediately start a new boom cycle.

“As you can see in the previous bottoming structures is that it takes a while. It starts to bottom out, makes a slight bounce, and then we start to make a compression, and the next bull wave starts.”

The crypto analyst is also looking at Chainlink, which he says is currently trading at a key level.

“If it loses the area around $10, which seems quite likely if Bitcoin is going to show weakness, which we do not know yet, but if we do get a lower high here, it is going to be quite likely that it will, then I’m going to look mainly at the $7 area for potential longs.”

XRP is also in the same predicament, says Van de Poppe.

“You don’t want to see the price drop below $0.22 – $0.23. If it holds here that’s fine but if it loses $0.23 – $0.22, I’m going to wait it out until it gets towards $0.19 as that’s the previous heavy support zone. If we do hold there, then we might be able to get another rally in towards $0.32 or maybe even $0.40 in the next cycle.”

The widely-followed trader is also bearish on SXP as he believes the utility token will continue its downtrend.

“At this point, we are at the support that I discussed. We are at $0.75. Are we going to hold here? I do not know for sure as there is no clear confirmation of any bottoming construction. But if we do not hold, the next area is around $0.57.”

Meanwhile, Van de Poppe warns his followers that altcoins have no bottom and they may continue crashing but he offers his two cents on timing the altcoin market.

“We’re going to see a sideways period for sometime which is the accumulation period before altcoins will wake up again.”

With immediate effect, a BSV/EUR trading pair is available for use on NovaDAX, part of a range of new offerings following the launch of its European operations earlier this month.

The move by NovaDAX to launch Bitcoin SV trading for its European customers follows the introduction of BSV/BRL and BSV/USDT trading pairs earlier this year . It comes as demand for Bitcoin SV continues to climb globally, as the utility of its massively scaling blockchain drives growth across its ecosystem of applications and services. Bitcoin SV also functions as a fast and cost-effective payments rail (sending a BSV payment currently costs less than 1/100 of a U.S. cent).

Launched in 2018, NovaDAX quickly grew to become one of the top exchanges in both Brazil and Latin America. In October 2020, NovaDAX officially launched its European operations via its UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorised entity, introducing several EUR fiat trading pairs, as well as the ability to deposit and withdraw via SEPA for all customers in European Economic Area (EEA) countries. NovaDAX in Europe offers all of its services in full compliance with all relevant EU laws and regulations. The entity of NovaDAX in Europe, is authorised as an Authorised Payment Institution (API) and an Electronic Money Services Directive (EMD) agent by the FCA.

Speaking on today's announcement, Beibei Liu, CEO of NovaDAX, said:

""We're developing NovaDAX in the European market to achieve outstanding results, just as we did in Brazil. We aim to provide the best liquidity in BSV/EUR trading pairs amongst all the major competitors in Europe while being regulated and authorised. We see huge potential in the adoption of Bitcoin SV and are aiming to provide the best experience in BSV trading which will bring us a lot of long term growth.""

Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of Bitcoin Association , the Switzerland-based global industry organisation that supports BSV, commented on today's news, saying:

""Bitcoin Association welcomes the addition of new fiat on-ramps to buy and sell Bitcoin SV for our European community. As a business that prioritises operating in a transparent and legally-compliant manner – and one that has already seen first-hand the growing wave of demand for Bitcoin SV all over the globe - NovaDAX is an ideal partner to continue that growth story across Europe.""

About Bitcoin Association

Bitcoin Association is a Switzerland-based global industry organization that works to advance business on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. It brings together essential components of the Bitcoin SV ecosystem – enterprises, start-up ventures, developers, merchants, exchanges, service providers, blockchain transaction processors (miners), and others – working alongside them, as well as in a representative capacity, to drive further use of the Bitcoin SV blockchain and uptake of the BSV digital currency.

The Association works to build a regulation-friendly ecosystem that fosters lawful conduct while facilitating innovation using all aspects of Bitcoin technology. More than a digital currency and blockchain, Bitcoin is also a network protocol; just like Internet protocol, it is the foundational rule set for an entire data network. The Association supports the use of the original Bitcoin protocol to operate the world's single blockchain on Bitcoin SV.

Stocks and Bitcoin will do well if Joe Biden wins the presidency and Republicans hold the Senate, Galaxy Digital CEO and investor Mike Novogratz said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday.

""The markets are liking this,"" Novogratz said about the prospect of a mostly conservative Senate and the end of President Trump's ""chaos.""

""Stocks are gonna do well,"" the former hedge-fund manager continued. ""People are gonna feel really comfortable"" about the nation's apparent rejection of far-left politicians, he added.

Novogratz predicted the tech-heavy Nasdaq index would outperform, as a Republican-controlled Senate would be less likely to impose new regulations on the nation's largest technology companies, or break them up.

Indeed, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet, and Microsoft shares all rose as much as 4% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

Novogratz, a vocal Bitcoin bull, also suggested a conservative Senate and less fiscal stimulus would be good for cryptocurrencies. ""Less fiscal, more Fed, good for crypto,"" he said.

That’s two crypto memes to describe how the crypto industry celebrated PayPal’s announcement that, from 2021 onwards, it will enable its 345 million customers worldwide to buy and sell bitcoin and other currencies from their accounts.

Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a Fintech Partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.

Shortly thereafter, crypto euphoria hit new heights when Southeast Asia’s largest bank, DBS, announced plans to launch a full-fledged crypto exchange. The announcement was later removed by the bank, but the crypto community had found enough reasons already to take bitcoin from $10,000 to $14,000 in two weeks.

DBS’ announcement was certainly more surprising for everyone because it referred to the service as a crypto exchange. Unlike Revolut’s crypto trading app that allows Revolut to trade principal for their customers and offset the risk on crypto exchanges making a margin in the process, DBS’ announcement referred to an exchange rather than an app or a feature. Since I witnessed firsthand a different high street banks’ unwillingness to give Coinbase a bank account in 2017, the news (albeit retracted) was as emotional as it gets in a professional sense.

Good for bitcoin?

Commentators on both the pro-coin and no-coin side were skeptical of PayPal’s baby steps. Believers are disappointed that PayPal’s customers can move crypto only inside PayPal’s network (you can’t withdraw or deposit your bitcoin). Skeptics are unsure if PayPal’s crypto integration gave anything truly new to the customers’ payments experience. Some acknowledged that a giant like PayPal could only ever take baby steps and allowing crypto withdrawals from the PayPal network was always going to be too risky from an AML standpoint.

Two fintech commentators, however, got to the crux of the matter, noting that Bitcoin is good for PayPal. First the FT’s Simon Taylor pointed out how bitcoin had increased customer engagement for Square’s Cash App, and then Ron Shevlin, writing in Forbes, highlighted that the need to compete with Cash App likely pushed PayPal to adopt bitcoin.

I celebrated the PayPal announcement. too, although for a different reason. The real value of the PayPal announcement isn’t that people will be able to buy and sell crypto. People can buy and sell crypto already on peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful and the numerous global and local crypto exchanges around the world. It’s that a small percentage of PayPal’s 345 million customers will be motivated to learn about crypto, and a large percentage of PayPal’s competitors will be motivated to see the industry in a wholly different light. In combination, these two factors will bring in tens of billions of dollars in retail assets into crypto over the next two years, turning minnows into tunas and tunas into whales.

Now that we know what’s coming, shouldn’t we all quit our COVID-era jobs and retire?

Regulation 10x

No, and here’s why. Where banks go, regulation follows. Outside the U.S., regulators have had a relatively laissez-faire approach to the crypto industry. China and India, which have banned bitcoin or virtual currencies at different points in time, have not enforced such bans in practice. Even the U.S. has been flexible in the interpretation of what are securities and in consumer protection regulation. This is for two reasons. First, most regulators have seen crypto as a fringe pursuit of the nerds. Second, regulators felt comfortable the fiat banking system is not exposed to risks arising from the crypto ecosystem.

Until 2018, regulators discouraged banks from working with crypto businesses. Crypto exchanges adopted stablecoins like tether in 2016-2017 and then broke through the regulatory “fiat-crypto barrier” in 2019 by partnering with small or medium-sized payments companies lacking banking licenses. Today, major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Blockchain.com and Binance have three or four banking partners in major jurisdictions with new fiat-to-crypto payment channels coming online every week. Indeed, banks serve payments that serve crypto but rarely serve crypto directly.

Where regulators draw the line

This is why the DBS announcement is much more significant than the PayPal announcement. We don’t know from the announcement that DBS will hold crypto on its balance sheet. But if the bank is operating an exchange, this is likely to be the case.

Unlike PayPal, which offers mainly payments and small consumer loans, DBS is a bank that takes insured deposits from customers and makes large loans to both individuals and institutional customers. While both are systemically important in different ways, after the 2009 debacle of Lehman Brothers deposit taking and institutional lending activities require compliance with a far more stringent set of prudential rules.

Where banks go, regulators follow and bring the entire mountain of compliance and risk management requirements with them.

In plain English, this is no longer about anti-money laundering compliance or token-friendly interpretations of securities laws alone. It is about a vast array of risk management requirements and controls that crypto firms do not have to deal with currently. For example, banks have to hold capital and implement a wide array of technology-, cyber- and data-related controls that cost money, personal hours, audits and processes, which mean lower profits and slower changes. Swiss crypto banks, which were the first to hold crypto on their balance sheets, are required to do everything that banks do and crypto firms just don’t.

Let’s make this simple again. Where banks go, regulators follow and bring the entire mountain of compliance and risk management requirements with them. So when banks start offering crypto services, not only will banks be asked to apply all of the banking regulations to crypto, crypto firms will also increasingly be asked to apply banking regulations.

Seasoned bankers like Caitlin Long understand this dynamic and have worked very hard to both influence regulators and bring banks to crypto firms like Kraken. Two of the large crypto firms for which I have consulted have sought to acquire banks and have been held off only by the sheer cost and effort of complying with banking regulations.

Now that cat has left the bag and there’s only one way this story ends. Over the next five years, most crypto firms will become banks and banks will become crypto firms. There is not going to be a fiat industry and a crypto industry. There will be only one banking, payments and capital markets industry that serves both fiat and crypto.

What this means for crypto

Four things: First, for consumers it means less risk and better standards of asset protection and consumer protection. When KuCoin got hacked, there was no major regulatory response. But if KuCoin was a U.K. bank and had got hacked, we’d have had an army of auditors looking at every paper inside the bank and announcing a major fine and a new set of controls.

Second, it means much lower profitability in crypto and fewer, higher-quality assets. Today, a developer can launch a borrowing and lending service with no know-your-customer compliance, no capital, no risk management and no personal liability. Such a token gets listed promptly on exchanges and, if it goes to zero in two weeks and customers are REKT, there’s no action from the regulators. Once banking rules apply, such an enterprise will be promptly shut down. Essentially the cost of launching new services, i.e. innovation, will go up by 100x slower. More expensive innovation is what we pay as a society for consumer protection and lower systemic risk.

Third, the overnight returns and venture cycles in crypto will get aligned with the long eight-year venture cycle in the rest of fintech. Harvest Finance, which was recently manipulated out of $24 million in customer funds, was quite fond of describing how its deposits grew much faster than Monzo. What the Harvest Finance team clearly doesn’t understand is the cost of simply launching Monzo is approximately $50 million to $100 million, whereas the cost of launching Harvest Finance is two guys living on ramen noodles in a garage. Further, Monzo is not allowed to lose $24 million in customer deposits and get away with a mere apology on Twitter. In the U.K., Monzo executives can actually be sanctioned and penalized for that sort of failure under the U.K. “senior manager” regime.

Fourth, if everyone is a bank and there are far fewer assets to trade at much higher cost, everyone except bank execs will make a lot less money, and those who lose today will lose a lot less. There will be far fewer exchange hacks, rug pulls, cottage industry scams and other such reminders of the pre-1934 Wall Street.

Is the crypto party over now?

No, in fact it’s just about to get much bigger but less entertaining. Banks won. Crypto believers might feel they have occupied Wall Street, and we might indeed have for some time, but the converse is now becoming true. Banks will increasingly occupy Crypto Street instead. If the announcement by the Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong on Tuesday is any indication, the era of crypto firms operating without licenses, registrations and the full weight of compliance and risk controls ends in a few years. Crypto firms like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, which seem to be taking active steps to get ahead of this convergence and obtain payments and banking licenses, will win big and those that don’t will find it rather difficult to survive as independent businesses beyond 2025.",2020-11-05 05:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-jumps-ethereum-gas-usage-grows,"Bitcoin is making gains during the U.S. presidential election uncertainty while Ethereum’s gas data is highlighting a DeFi decline.

“Bitcoin has recovered from its post-election drop, crossing the $14,000 level once more,” said John Kramer, a trader at crypto market making firm GSR. “The asset has done a good job of going its own way all year, vastly outperforming stocks.”

Bitcoin is up 90% versus the S&P 500’s comparatively paltry 4.5% performance in 2020.

Stocks are up Wednesday despite the lack of a confirmed winner as yet in the U.S. presidential election. “Equities are unmoved by the uncertainty, rallying in the face of two possible outcomes,” GSR’s Kramer added.

Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, said he is not convinced that bitcoin’s jump Wednesday has anything to do with the election’s outcome. “While all eyes are on the election, it’s too early to attribute bitcoin’s gains to it in terms of the macro policy impact from either candidate,” Lau told CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency analysts are also keeping an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength against a basket of other currencies, which is up 0.15% as of press time. “The dollar downtrend is due to resume,” said Bill Noble, Chief Technical Analyst at Token Metrics.

Bitcoiners, as is often the case, remain bullish nevertheless.

“Too many people believe the election can stop the crypto uptrend,” Token Metrics’ Noble said. “A strong desire for economic freedom and the emergence of inflation drives the uptrend in crypto. Those trends are in motion, and they will remain in motion regardless of who occupies the White House.”

“My opinion is BTC will go up regardless of who wins this election in the short- to mid-term,” noted Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader.

One signal for bullish sentiment: Overnight, over 6,700 CME bitcoin futures contracts traded (33,500 equivalent BTC), 75% more than what has been observed year to date and more than double the volume observed since launch, according to a representative from CME.

Ethereum gas up, fees down

Usage on Ethereum, in terms of total gas, has grown 113% in 2020 so far, from 37,252,588,523 on Jan. 1 to 79,617,868,730 on Tuesday.

Ben Chan, vice president of engineering for oracle provider Chainlink, says this data suggests despite the growth in 2020, there is currently less demand on the Ethereum network as interest in DeFi has seemingly waned. “What this could mean is people are less urgent to get transactions in, they’re willing to wait longer,” he told CoinDesk.

The announcement appeared in Bitcoin.com, among other publications. Here’s the overview of the announcement:

Paypal CEO Dan Schulman provided new details of the company’s new cryptocurrency service during the Q3 2020 earnings call on Monday. Paypal recently announced that its customers will be able to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, directly from their Paypal accounts. Cryptocurrencies in Paypal accounts can also be used to pay for purchases at 28 million stores worldwide. Regarding Paypal’s recently announced crypto service, the CEO shared: “Our base is very eager for us to offer these capabilities. It really came up very high on their wish list.” He additionally revealed: We’ve only rolled this out to 10% of our base. We did that a couple of days ago. But our waiting list is 2 to 3 times what our expectations were. We are going to take up our $10,000 limit per day to $15,000 per day based on the demand that we are seeing.

After reading the disclosure agreement on PayPal’s site that you can find here, I really don’t understand the hype. Here are just a couple of items from the disclosure:

You currently are NOT able to send Crypto Assets to family or friends, use Crypto Assets to pay for goods or services, or withdraw Crypto Assets from your Cryptocurrencies Hub to an external cryptocurrency wallet. If you want to withdraw the value from your Cryptocurrencies Hub you will need to sell your Crypto Assets and withdraw the cash proceeds from their sale.

This seems to say that I can’t send bitcoin or another cryptocurrency from my PayPal account through Venmo or another method. I can’t buy anything with my crypto balance. I can sell my cryptocurrency, convert it to dollars, and then go buy something.

And then there’s this:

PayPal makes money when you buy and sell Crypto Assets. PayPal will charge a spread (or margin) between the market price we receive from our trading Service Provider and the exchange rate between USD and Crypto Assets displayed to you. The amount that PayPal makes and the exchange rate provided may be different than what you would pay on other cryptocurrency platforms. You will also be charged a fee when you buy or sell Crypto Assets. More information on pricing and fees can be found on the PayPal Fees page.

It makes sense that PayPal needs to charge fees, but how is this different than holding a very volatile foreign currency?

In CoinDesk Research’s latest monthly report, we take a brief look at the progress bitcoin and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, made in October, as well as some of the stories their on-chain metrics are telling us. Momentum is gathering, as shown by the growing congestion in the Bitcoin network and the technological evolution – Eth 2.0 – in Ethereum. And the use case of each is gradually becoming more clear as market and on-chain metrics start to paint a more detailed picture.

The volatility story

While BTC’s volatility was largely flat throughout October, ETH’s volatility declined. This is likely an adjustment from the jump in September, when the ETH 30-day volatility increased by a significantly greater amount than that of BTC, as seen by the spike and then the fall in the ETH/BTC volatility ratio (blue line). This underscores that the ETH market is still more immature than that of BTC, and could imply that the pending change in ETH’s technology underpinnings is adding a level of uncertainty into an evolving market.

Source: Coin Metrics

Bitcoin gets congested

Looking at the average block weight (dark blue line), we can see that Bitcoin blocks have been at near full capacity for the longest stretch since May. This can also be seen in the spike in average time between blocks (green line). Network congestion is a common feature of price rallies and usually results in an increase in transaction fees. This more recent congestion, however, has produced a much higher fee spike than in May, even when the U.S. dollar price increase is taken out of the equation, hinting at greater demand for transaction processing.

Source: Coin Metrics

Ethereum calms down

Average transaction fees on Ethereum fell over 80% in October, retracing September’s sharp increase. The percentage of miner revenue from fees also declined sharply from a high of 75% in September to 30% by the end of October. Both metrics suggest lower user and dapp activity on Ethereum as the hype around decentralized finance (DeFi) applications starts to ebb. This is a positive sign for the network, which in recent months has been pushed to its limits by the splashy debuts of new DeFi assets such as COMP, SUSHI and others.

The Department of Justice said Thursday that it seized approximately $1 billion worth of bitcoin, its biggest cryptocurrency seizure ever.

The announcement solves a a years-old mystery about the shuttered Silk Road dark web market for illegal drugs and other unlawful goods, widely regarded as the largest and most extensive dark web marketplace of its time before its 2013 demise.

The law enforcement action solves another riddle about a bitcoin wallet that just saw a nearly identically valued amount of cryptocurrency withdrawn after sitting dormant for a long time.

“The successful prosecution of Silk Road’s founder in 2015 left open a billion-dollar question. Where did the money go?” said U.S. Attorney David Anderson. “Today’s forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part. $1 billion of these criminal proceeds are now in the United States’ possession.”

Motherboard reported Wednesday on the Election Day emptying of the wallet. Then the complaint, filed Thursday, detailed how federal investigators tracked down someone identified only as “Individual X,” who had hacked the funds from Silk Road — much to the dismay of Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht.

“According to the investigation, Ulbricht became aware of Individual X’s online identity and threatened Individual X for return of the cryptocurrency to Ulbritcht,” the complaint reads. “Individual X did not return the cryptocurrency, but kept it and did not spend it.”

$1B BTC forfeiture

The U.S. government is suing for the forfeiture of thousands of bitcoins, totaling more than $1 billion, that it seized on Tuesday. These bitcoins are said by the U.S. Department of Justice to be connected with the Silk Road marketplace. The address holding the bitcoins has been dormant since 2015, when the coins were transferred to now defunct crypto exchange BTC-e. According to Bloomberg, authorities seized the funds from an unknown hacker who had gained access to the address. The BTC are now likely to be auctioned, reintroducing them to the market supply. Near equivalent amounts of bitcoin gold, bitcoin sv and bitcoin cash were also recovered from the address.

Fat-fingered

Reddit user “ProudBitcoiner” accidentally paid 23.5172 ETH (approximately $9,400) fee on a $120 transaction, the person disclosed in a post. The costly mistake occurred while manually entering a “Gas Price” while executing a swap on the DeFi liquidity protocol Uniswap rather than a “Gas Limit.” Mining pool Ethermine processed the transaction and collected the windfall fee, which was way higher than the current average of 0.0022 ETH ($1.07), though ProudBitcoiner has contacted the miner for assistance in potentially recovering the fee.

Mining co-venture

One of the largest aluminum and power producers in the world will begin crypto mining through a joint venture with BitRiver, which already owns the largest mining venue in Russia and is looking to expand. En+, whose largest shareholder is Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska, owns four major hydropower plants in Siberia that produce about 7% of the country’s electricity. The joint venture (an 80/20 split between En+ and BitRiver) will offer 10 megawatts of power for miners to host ASICs, with the potential to expand to 40 megawatts. En+ was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018, though these prohibitions have since been lifted.

Exchange expansion

Coinbase is hiring in Japan, with renewed plans to launch. While the U.S.-based exchange has not received a mandatory operating license from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), in March it became a second-class member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, a self-regulatory organization approved by the regulator. IT, data, finance and accounting, legal, marketing and communications, customer experience, and international expansion roles are currently open. CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports Coinbase has had plans to expand into Japan since 2016.

Privacy preservation

Wasabi Wallet is looking to overhaul its privacy-focused bitcoin software wallet with user-centric design and privacy improvements including automatic, default CoinJoins. (A CoinJoin is a method of mixing BTC transactions from multiple users to better conceal identities). Separately, Blockstream engineers will roll out improvements to bitcoin multi-signature transactions, with privacy benefits. The “MuSig2” design builds on previous multi-signature schemes – a way to authorize transactions using more than one private key – while reducing the technical complexity and amount of communication between parties to operate.

Bitcoin’s stimulus

Bitcoin crossed $15,000, the first time since January 2018. The cryptocurrency is now up 7.8% over the past 24 hours and over 108% on a year-to-date basis, with little sign of slowing. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes this recent rally is represents a ~40% climb in the last four weeks alone. Buoyed by an imminent sense of monetary stimulus, indeterminate of who wins the U.S. presidential election, analysts predict this rise to continue. “We may not know what a post-election [fiscal] stimulus may look like, but investors continue to believe that the [Federal Reserve] will keep printing money at a pace that favors bitcoins finite supply,” John Kramer, a trader at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.

At stake

Anyone’s bet

Prediction markets are still buzzing with activity amid the uncertainty of the current U.S. presidential election process. Yesterday, decentralized predictions platform Polymarket became the fourth-highest fee-generating blockchain project, according to Cryptofees, only behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi protocol Uniswap.

Currently, perhaps obviously, the largest pool on Polymarket is “Will Trump win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?,” with nearly $8.8 million in trading volume. While predictions flipped in President Donald Trump’s favor on the first night of ballot counting, most bettors now see former Vice President Joseph Biden as favored to win.

“I think us being top 4 of fee-generating blockchain apps, literally anything blockchain-related, is insanity,” Shayne Coplan, Polymarket CEO, told CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair. “Just in this election cycle alone, we have seen our volume surpass $10 million which is a lot higher than we expected in such a short time frame.”

Of course, prediction markets are not the only way for people to take bets out on election results. It’s likely most markets are, in some way, processing the current moment of anxiety and uncertainty.

For instance, trading in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures during the U.S. election has spiked 75% above the 2020 average. The CME is routinely one of the largest, and most institutionally-driven crypto options exchanges. Average daily open positions, which allow traders the option to buy bitcoin between a specified period, was up 20% in just the first two days in November compared to October.

Making sense of bitcoin’s current three-year high, Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, said that no matter the electoral outcome, monetary stimulus is to be expected. This strengthens one of bitcoin’s core narratives (the things people believe about the oldest cryptocurrency) as a hedge against inflation.

“If there is social disorder because of a Trump win, the Fed prints. If the election result is a blue wave and taxes rise, the dollar falls because the Fed prints more, and more and more,” Noble said.

Going back to predictions markets: Anthony Sassano wrote, “I’ve long thought that one of the major reasons prediction markets hadn’t taken off yet was due to little to no interesting markets being available to bet on.”

That’s not to say predictions markets are any better or worse than traditional ways of measuring risk. Cami Russo’s The Defiant publication said Ethereum prediction markets are the “best or worst answer” to uncertainty, while Decrypt found FTX’s platform largely mirrors FiveThirtyEight’s model.

With election headlines currently dominating the discourse, the stakes are high and the bets are on.

Who won #CryptoTwitter?",2020-11-05 17:55:14+00:00,https://mashable.com/article/hacker-stole-billion-cryptocurrency-silk-road-seized-us-government/,"The U.S. government is trying to seize what ""Individual X"" had already stolen. Specifically, that would be a gargantuan amount of cryptocurrency.

In a surprise reveal to a mystery that's bedeviled the cryptocurrency community for years, the Department of Justice announced today that it has seized just over a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency and is seeking to claim it as its own. What's more, in a criminal complaint arguing for the government's right to hold onto the seized digital currency, law enforcement revealed the cryptocurrency's source: It was stolen years ago from the Silk Road.

The details in the criminal complaint are wild, and worth breaking down. According to law enforcement, sometime in either 2012 or 2013, when the Silk Road illegal darknet market was up and operational, a person the government calls ""Individual X"" hacked into the online bazaar known for drugs and fake IDs (among other, less pleasant, offerings) and stole large amounts of bitcoin.

""According to the investigation, [Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht] became aware of Individual X's online identity and threatened Individual X for return of the cryptocurrency to Ulbricht,"" the complaint states. ""Individual X did not return the cryptocurrency but kept it and did not spend it.""

Notably, it was a lot of cryptocurrency to simply not spend. According to the complaint, we're talking about ""approximately"" 69,370 bitcoin, 69,370 bitcoin gold, 69,370 bitcoin SV, and 69,370 bitcoin cash.

As of today, those different cryptocurrencies combined come out to around $1,066,389,000. In other words, this amounts to the largest government seizure of cryptocurrency we've seen to date.

""The successful prosecution of Silk Road's founder in 2015 left open a billion-dollar question,"" U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson is quoted as saying in a DOJ press release . ""Where did the money go? Today's forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part.""

Officials reportedly seized the stolen cryptocurrency on Nov. 3, and moved it into a wallet they controlled — sparking a flurry of news coverage in the process. According to the DOJ press release, the investigation was carried out by the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit. The IRS had help from two companies, Chainalysis and Excygent, in tracking down Individual X. Chainalysis in particular is known for its ability to track cryptocurrency transactions.

The speculation as to who moved the money is now officially over. And while the public remains in the dark as to the identity of Individual X, the government definitely knows. Maybe that's why Individual X decided to play nice with law enforcement.

Among publicly traded companies, it could be said that Jack Dorsey’s Square has led the way in building bitcoin services, first piloting bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in late 2017. PayPal confirmed its rumored support for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin just last month.

Square went one step further in Q3, however, officially adding bitcoin to its balance sheet rather than simply making it available to customers.

Square acknowledged its October announcement of a $50 million purchase of bitcoin as a treasury asset in its shareholder letter. Bitcoin’s price hovered under $11,000 at the time. As of this writing it has broken $15,000.

“We announced two strategic investments,” Dorsey said during the earnings call. “The second was a $50 million investment in bitcoin, which we believe will be the native currency of the internet, and help people thrive around the world and the economy.”

Past earnings

In Q1 2020, Square brought in $306 million in revenue from selling bitcoin in the Cash App. It brought in $875 million in revenue in Q2. However, the margin on bitcoin sales is always quite small for Square. In late 2019, the company changed the way it supported its bitcoin business, shifting to a fee-based model, in order to make costs to buyers more transparent.

Sales of bitcoin in Cash App earn Square a little under 2% in profit, which is a very thin margin compared to Square’s overall business, which runs at much higher margins. For example, the company overall made $597 million on $1.92 billion in revenue in the second quarter, or roughly a 31% profit.

Overall, the Cash App also delivers stronger profits. In the second quarter, it brought in $1.2 billion worth of revenue and $281 million in gross profit, according to its Q2 shareholder letter.

Cash app’s profit in the third quarter hit $385 million.

The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) says it has seized cryptocurrencies worth $24 million after receiving an official request from the government of Brazil. The seizure stems from an ongoing investigation into the $200 million cryptocurrency scam that may have defrauded tens of thousands of Brazilians. The authorities in Brazil say the scammers duped people by typically promising exaggerated returns and falsifying where the funds were invested.

Criminal violations

In a statement, the DOJ says the U.S. acceded to Brazil’s request in line with the cooperation treaty signed between the two countries with respect to “Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.”

Meanwhile, according to the DOJ statement, “the U.S. seizures were tied to Brazilian Marcos Antonio Fagundes’ alleged role in the scheme.” Fagundes and several unnamed accomplices have been “charged with several criminal violations of Brazilian law, including, among other offences, the operation of a financial institution without legal authorization.”

The statement adds that the accused also faces charges of “fraudulent management of a financial institution, misappropriation, and money laundering, as well as securities law violations.”

The DOJ statement provides a short summary of a Brazilian court’s findings against Fagundes and his accomplices. The statement says:

During August 2017 to May 2019, Fagundes and other defendants solicited funds from prospective investors over the internet, sometimes in combination with telephone and other means, and held the funds received in a manner that subjected it to regulation as a financial institution under Brazilian law, with which Fagundes and the other defendants failed to comply.

The statement reveals that the “defendants solicited investors to give money to corporations they controlled, in the form of Brazilian currency or cryptocurrency, which the companies would then invest in a variety of virtual currency types.”

False claims

However, as the Brazilian court found, “only a very small amount of funds were invested in cryptocurrencies as promised, and very little was returned to the investors.”

Meanwhile, the DOJ says U.S. authorities are now working in close cooperation with the Brazilian authorities and others to “restrain the virtual currency and preserve it for forfeiture proceedings pending in Brazil to compensate the investors victimized in this fraudulent investment scheme.”

The statement concludes that “the cryptocurrency firm holding the accounts cooperated with law enforcement authorities in executing this seizure.” Still, the statement does not give the name of the cooperating crypto firm.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin Cash's next hard fork will take place on Nov. 15.

Several exchanges state that they will support both coins if the fork splits BCH into two separate assets.

BCHN, which opposes a tax on miners, has widespread support.

Share this article

Various cryptocurrency exchanges have detailed their plans to handle an upcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork, which could split the cryptocurrency into two separate coins next week.

Exchanges Will Support Both Coins

At least five exchanges have announced that they will support both Bitcoin Cash tokens if a split occurs.

Binance believes it is “likely that there [will be] a chain-split between the two main BCH clients,” while Huobi Global says that it will “support the BCH hard fork.”

FTX, OKEX, and Gate.io have expressed similar stances.

Though their exact policies vary, these exchanges will allow users to hold coins under two separate market tickers: BCHN (for Bitcoin Cash Node) and BCHA or BCHABC (for Bitcoin Cash ABC). This also means that BCH holders will be airdropped a coin from the minority chain at a 1:1 ratio, the same as would happen if they were holding Bitcoin Cash in a non-custodial wallet.

However, that outcome is only possible if the Bitcoin Cash community decides to maintain the forked chain for a significant amount of time. If the community quickly abandons the minority chain, the situation may be immediately resolved.

The dominant coin will likely be designated BCH, even if a second coin exists.

So far, only Gate.io has hinted at the possibility that the two forked coins will last long enough for regular trading: “If we are going to support the trading of “Candy” [the minority coin] we will let you know by posting it on our announcement.”

Other companies have also weighed in on the fork. Hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor, for example, says that it will only choose one coin to support, favoring the chain with greater mining power.

Will Bitcoin Cash Split in Two?

It is not clear that there is enough support for a lasting minority fork. At the moment, 75% of Bitcoin Cash blocks signal support for Bitcoin Cash to succeed, while just 1% signal for Bitcoin Cash ABC.

The central issue during this fork is an Infrastructure Funding Plan (IFP) that was proposed by Bitcoin Cash ABC earlier this year. That proposal taxes miners to fund BCH development, which caused significant backlash within the Bitcoin Cash community. Several mining companies denounced the plan in August.

However, Bitcoin Cash ABC was once the dominant node software, and parts of the Chinese mining community favor the IFP. As such, it will not be clear how the hard fork plays out until it actually occurs. The fork is set to take place on Nov. 15, 2020.

The recent rally left the largest cryptocurrency up 116% year to date, and some bullish digital-asset market analysts were already looking at even higher levels. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the crypto prime broker Bequant, said in an email there’s the potential for a squeeze in the options market to push up prices in the next several days.

“This, coupled with continued uncertainty around U.S. election results and the economic fallout from the Covid pandemic’s resurgence, could see us push towards $17,000,” he said.

In traditional markets, U.S. futures were lower ahead of a closely-watched government report due out Friday on employment trends in October. Gold rose 0.3% to $1,956 an ounce.

Market Moves

As bitcoin shot above $15,000, analysts on Thursday were reaching back into the cryptocurrency’s 11-year history for clues on what comes next.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Prices have already doubled this year, just as they did in 2019, and bitcoin is now being openly discussed by global banks like Deutsche Bank as the world’s best-performing asset. A lot of observers say the price movements are random and not necessarily linked to broad macroeconomic trends. While the relationship remains on the weaker side, for most of this year, correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price movements and traditional markets have been increasing.

And the investment narrative that bitcoin fund marketeers are pitching looks pretty strong at the moment: Not only has the cryptocurrency been cast by many bulls as the future of money and perhaps a threat to the existing financial system, but it’s also positioned as an inflation hedge at a time when the Federal Reserve and other central banks are printing trillions of dollars of money to stimulate markets and economies, with few apparent signs of any slowdown.

Now there’s a belief among many traders that the fear of missing out, or FOMO, could drive faster adoption of cryptocurrencies by both retail and institutional investors – and rapidly drive prices to a new record high above $20,000.

That’s where the history lesson comes in. As some analysts have been signaling this week, bitcoin prices have now entered a territory they’ve so rarely visited before that investors reading price-chart patterns – a widely followed practice among crypto traders known as “technical analysis” – see easy-to-spot stopping points between $15,000 and $20,000.

“The technical setup has been building for a while now, and it has finally broken through,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email.

Price closing history by level Source: Messari

The screen grab above, from the digital-asset-market analysis firm Messari, shows that bitcoin had previously traded just 20 days above the $15,000 price level, all of them in 2017.

And it was powerful indeed: Once the $15,000 level was breached, bitcoin quickly shot up to the all-time high near $20,000.

Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Diginex, called it a “price vacuum.” So the speculation now is that a repeat might be in the cards.

This all might be wishful thinking from traders who analysts and investors who really have no more insight into the future than anyone else and are just lucky enough to be in digital-asset markets at a time when the fast-growing ecosystem seems to be one of the few sectors that’s truly thriving.

Fear and greed Source: Arcane Research

A slow, steady advance might be more convincing to newcomers and the “crypto curious” than a quick march to the top that’s quickly reversed. Whatever the case, the prevailing mood in the market is pushing toward “extreme greed” from “fear” just a month ago.

“The case for bitcoin gets stronger every day,” according to Messari. “Resistance is futile.”

If there even is any.

Bitcoin watch

Worldwide searches on keywords ""Bitcoin price"" since 2015. Source: Google Trends

Web search data suggests popular interest in bitcoin remains at normal levels, despite a sharp price rally to near $16,000.



The top cryptocurrency has chalked up a nearly 50% gain in the past four weeks to trade as high as $15,971 early Friday, a level last seen during the bull market frenzy between December 2017 and January 2018.

Some observers say the rally is now being driven higher by retail greed and fear of missing out, known as FOMO. However, Google data suggests otherwise.

Google Trends, a barometer used to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 10 for the worldwide search query “bitcoin price.”

That’s significantly lower than the value of 93 observed in early December 2017 following bitcoin’s record break above $15,000. The current reading is also lower than the peak of 19 observed in the second week of May when bitcoin underwent its third mining reward “halving.”

Google’s data suggests that retail investors are showing calm over bitcoin’s recent rally and the market is far from being in a state of bull frenzy.

With popular interest still relatively low, it seems safe to say that FOMO is yet to take hold of the market and the ongoing institutional-driven rally has legs.

Scorned by skeptics since its inception, the value of the cryptocurrency has gone from less than $0.01 to nearly $15,000. Along the way, bitcoin has suffered huge plunges, but so far, it's always found a way to pull back higher.

Now things are lining up for bitcoin. If there were ever a time for the premier cryptocurrency to challenge and surpass its record highs from three years ago, it's right now. Regardless of whether you believe in the potential of crypto or think it's a passing fad, this is bitcoin's defining moment -- the moment when it will show whether it can achieve mainstream popularity or remain a niche asset class.

The bull argument for bitcoin

Bitcoin's fundamental premise has been that decentralized digital currency offers advantages over government-issued fiat currencies for those seeking to preserve value. Bitcoin owners don't have to worry about the actions of central banks or regulators and their potential impact on its value in comparison to other forms of money.

As a result, bitcoin has tended to perform the best when there's doubt about the ability of the traditional monetary system to handle challenging conditions. By contrast, when the financial system seems strong, the demand for bitcoin has often eased lower.

There's arguably never been a time when there were more factors favoring bitcoin:

As of late Thursday, Nov. 5, the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election were still unknown. Vote counting continued to proceed, and legal challenges to the results could create uncertainty for weeks to come.

The COVID-19 pandemic is putting unprecedented pressure on the global economy. Tens of millions of Americans are out of work, and discussions for further government stimulus measures have run into a political wall.

Central banks around the world are resorting to extraordinary measures to shore up the financial system and ensure some measure of stability. However, many believe that there are few additional options for central banks to take further action if current measures fall short.

Back in May, the reward that bitcoin miners received for their work got cut in half. Past ""halving"" events have often led to a subsequent rise in bitcoin prices.

It's becoming increasingly easy to buy bitcoin and use it in transactions. Electronic-payment giant PayPal Holdings NASDAQ:PYPL) latest company to offer trading in bitcoin, as well as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. As mainstream companies increase adoption, bitcoin will become a more common way of conducting transactions.

It's therefore not surprising to see bitcoin pushing higher. In just the last month, bitcoin prices have risen from just over $10,000 to just below $15,000. That has many calling for the cryptocurrency to rise further and challenge its all-time high just under $20,000, set back in December 2017.

Expect huge volatility

One valid criticism of bitcoin is that the market for the cryptocurrency has been incredibly volatile. Long-term investors have gotten rewarded handsomely but have had to endure multiple gut-wrenching drops of 90% along the way. The most recent major decline for bitcoin slashed more than half its value during the COVID-19 bear market.

Indeed, skeptical observers cite bitcoin's failure to perform during the early days of the global pandemic as evidence that the cryptocurrency doesn't serve the purpose its advocates intend it to serve. Rather than providing a safe haven in tough times, bitcoin merely acted like a host of other investment assets.

Now's the time to watch bitcoin

Nevertheless, bitcoin has its chance right now to break into the mainstream. As more people get access to participate in another big move higher for cryptocurrencies, investors will get to see firsthand whether bitcoin reaches its full potential as a viable alternative to fiat currency.

Rising adoption could finally push bitcoin over the threshold into mainstream acceptance. But if bitcoin falls flat this time around, the investors that the cryptocurrency needs to embrace it might finally lose faith once and for all.",2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.tradestation.com/insights/2020/11/06/crypto-bull-market-continues-to-roar-higher/,"Summary

Cryptocurrencies fluctuated in reaction to the U.S election but finished higher.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) plans to carry out a hard fork (11/15)

Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a volatile manner due to uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and rising COVID-19 numbers but finished higher for a third straight week. BTC’s price swelled as high as $16,000 before settling at $15,500 to close the week. Some short-term digestion is not surprising after such a move higher.

Democratic challenger Joe Biden approached victory in a razor-thin presidential vote count while Republicans gained seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and held key senate seats. Both equity and crypto markets embraced the idea of a split government, soaring on the news. A split government means more checks and balances and alleviates the concern that one political party will dictate the country’s direction.

Ethereum (ETH) also rose in anticipation of the upcoming release of Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum 2.0 is a highly anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum network. ETH 2.0 will supposedly provide more scalability and tighter security to the network.

Bitcoin (BTC) explodes higher in the last 3 weeks.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork to occur November 15th

Next Week’s Market Forecast

Before the U.S. election occurred, volatility in most major asset classes shot higher and later subsided as the outcome became more certain. Typically, markets do not like uncertainty. Mr. Biden seems to have the easiest route to victory at this juncture but sitting President Donald Trump has vowed to forge on with a court battle to overturn what he sees as an unfair election. Investors should be aware that any prolonged court battle could lead to another increase in volatility in the short-term, especially with prices as heated as they are now.

For now, the major cryptocurrencies remain in a robust bull market. Until the price trend changes, it is hard to think otherwise. This does not mean a pullback is out of the question short-term, however. One key event to watch moving forward is the upcoming Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork set for November 15th. A fork is when a user base or group of developers decide something fundamental about the cryptocurrency must change.",2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/06/us-seizes-1bn-in-bitcoin-linked-to-silk-road-site,"DoJ is suing for formal forfeiture of funds after tracking down the person holding them

The US government has seized more than $1bn worth of bitcoins connected to the shuttered darknet marketplace Silk Road and is suing for formal forfeiture of the funds.

The case is the biggest cryptocurrency seizure in history, and explains why the bitcoins changed hands this week. Analysts had noticed the transfer on the public blockchain and speculated that it was either due to an unknown Silk Road co-conspirator attempting to cash out, or because the funds had been stolen by hackers.

In fact, the Department of Justice says it tracked down the real holder of the funds, a person it calls “Individual X”, through their attempts to liquidate a small portion of the money in 2015. “On approximately 23 April 2015, [the bitcoin account] sent 101 bitcoin (approximately $23,700) to BTC-e, a company that provided bitcoin-related services and operated as an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange,” the criminal complaint says.

“Silk Road was the most notorious online criminal marketplace of its day,” said the US attorney David Anderson. “The successful prosecution of Silk Road’s founder in 2015 left open a billion-dollar question. Where did the money go? Today’s forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part. $1bn of these criminal proceeds are now in the United States’ possession.”

Individual X, “whose identity is known to the government”, did not work with Silk Road, the complaint alleges. Instead, “Individual X was able to hack into Silk Road and gain unauthorised and illegal access to Silk Road and thereby steal the illicit cryptocurrency from Silk Road and move it into wallets that Individual X controlled.

“According to the investigation, [Ross Ulbricht, the now jailed founder of the site] became aware of Individual X’s online identity and threatened Individual X for return of the cryptocurrency to Ulbricht. Individual X did not return the cryptocurrency but kept it and did not spend it,” the complaint says.

The complaint, officially titled in part “United States of America vs Approximately 69,370 Bitcoin”, requires the DoJ to prove in court that the seized cryptocurrency is subject to forfeiture, meaning it is the proceeds of a criminal act.

The IRS criminal investigation (CI) special agent in charge, Kelly R Jackson, said: “Criminal proceeds should not remain in the hands of the thieves. Through CI’s expertise in following the money, we were able to track down the illicit funds. The Washington DC cyber crimes unit is uniquely specialised in tracing virtual currency transactions and we will continue to hone our skills to combat illegal activity.”

Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm that helped the government in its investigation, said: “Earlier this year, IRS-CI agents used Chainalysis to analyse bitcoin transactions executed by Silk Road and identified 54 previously undetected bitcoin transactions representing the proceeds of unlawful activity. They also found that a hacker, known as Individual X, stole those funds from Silk Road.

“According to Chainalysis data, Silk Road accounted for nearly 20% of total bitcoin economic activity at its peak in 2013. Silk Road’s economic activity reached $435m total (calculated based on the price of bitcoin at the time), with a peak of just under $40m in monthly volume in September of 2013.”

The $1bn value of the seizure is equivalent to the total value of all cash and cash equivalents seized by the federal government in 2015, the most recent year for which records are available.",2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552339/us-goverment-seizes-1-billion-bitcoin-profits-silk-road-wallet-individual-x,"Earlier this week, the bitcoin community was shocked when a digital wallet containing roughly $1 billion in bitcoin — thought to be proceeds from the now-shuttered dark web drug marketplace Silk Road — was emptied by an unknown individual. Now, those responsible for cleaning out the funds have revealed themselves: it was the US government.

The Department of Justice announced on Thursday that it had seized the wallet’s contents as part of a civil forfeiture case targeting the Silk Road. The government said it retrieved the roughly 70,000 bitcoins with the help of an unnamed hacker, whose identity is known to the government but who is simply referred to as “Individual X” in court documents.

“Individual X” allegedly hacked the Silk Road’s payments system some time in 2012 or 2013. The government says that the Silk Road’s creator Ross Ulbricht, who is currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years for his role in the site, “threatened Individual X for the return of the cryptocurrency,” but the unknown hacker refused. On November 3rd, Individual X agreed to forfeit the bitcoin to the US government and helped transfer the money. It’s unclear if Individual X has been arrested or how their cooperation was attained.

“Where did the money go? Today’s forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part”

In a press statement, US Attorney David L. Anderson celebrated the operation as a big success for the government. “Silk Road was the most notorious online criminal marketplace of its day,” said Anderson. “The successful prosecution of Silk Road’s founder in 2015 left open a billion-dollar question. Where did the money go? Today’s forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part. $1 billion of these criminal proceeds are now in the United States’ possession.”

Silk Road was “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace” on the internet, said the Department of Justice, operating between 2011 and 2013 before it was taken offline by the FBI. The US government estimates that the website generated around 600,000 bitcoins in commissions during this period. Around 175,000 of these were seized when Ulbricht was arrested and the website shut down in October 2013.

The Department of Justice did not say what it plans to do with the $1 billion in newly-seized bitcoins, but in the past it has auctioned off similar hauls of cryptocurrency. Such sales are processed like any other civil forfeiture, reports The Wall Street Journal, with profits kept by the agency and added to its budget.",2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-seizes-1bn-from-silk-road/,"The United States has seized more than $1bn in cryptocurrency believed to be proceeds from a defunct online marketplace that was notorious for selling unlawful goods and services.

On November 5, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint to seek the forfeiture of thousands of Bitcoins seized by law enforcement on November 3, 2020, from an account associated with Silk Road. The seizure represents the largest confiscation of cryptocurrency in the department's history.

Silk Road was established in 2011 and shut down by the FBI after two years of operation. The site's creator, Ross Ulbricht, was convicted in 2015 by a New York federal jury of seven criminal counts, including conspiracy to distribute narcotics and money laundering, and is currently serving a custodial sentence.

According to the complaint, Silk Road was used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs as well as other illegal goods and services to over 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from these unlawful transactions.

Silk Road had thousands of listings for illegal services, including computer hacking and murder for hire, along with 13,000 listings for controlled substances at the time the site was taken down.

The complaint alleges that these listings generated sales revenue totaling over 9.5 million Bitcoins and commissions from these sales totaling over 600,000 Bitcoins.

It further alleges that Silk Road used a “tumbler” to process Bitcoin transactions in such a way that individual transactions could not be tracked through the cryptocurrency blockchain.

Funds identified by the IRS CI in 2020 to be linked to Silk Road accounts were traced to a particular Bitcoin address connected to Individual X, according to the complaint. It was further determined that Individual X had hacked the funds from Silk Road.

The movement of the substantial sum of Bitcoin from a wallet associated with Silk Road on November 3 was spotted by the eagle-eyed blockchain forensics team at CipherTrace.

The team theorized that the transfer could have been motivated by the wallet owner's desire to prevent hackers breaking in and stealing the funds.",2020-11-06 17:30:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/squares-bitcoin-bet-is-paying-off-183613329.html,"Square (SQ) shares surged 12% on Friday after the company blew away analyst expectations with its Q3 earnings report on Thursday. Square reported earnings of 34 cents per share (more than double the expected 16 cents per share) on revenue of $3.03 billion (vs. expectations of $2.05 billion).

The performance of its peer-to-peer Cash App was a huge highlight: Cash App revenue rose 174% from Q3 2019, and profit rose 212%.

And then there was bitcoin.

Square’s bitcoin revenue from Cash App trading was $1.63 billion in Q3, up 21% from $875 million in Q2 2020, up 618% from Q3 2019, and its first quarter with more than $1 billion in bitcoin revenue. Square’s bitcoin profit was $32 million, nearly double the $17 million from Q2 2020 and up 1,500% from Q3 2019.

$32 million is a small slice of the company’s $749 million in gross profit in the quarter. But consider that just one year ago, Square’s quarterly bitcoin profit was $2 million. (Square added a bitcoin-buying feature to Cash App in 2018.)

Of course, Square’s heightened bitcoin profit is thanks to bitcoin’s price surge: the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up 115% in 2020, and this week, amid the uncertainty of the U.S. presidential election, it broke through $15,000, its highest level since January 2018.

But Square also says it saw big growth in Q3 in “bitcoin actives and volume per customer.” In other words, more Cash App users are buying bitcoin, and they’re buying more of it.

In the third quarter, Square also went further in its bitcoin embrace by outright purchasing $50 million worth of bitcoin (4,709 BTC) as an asset on its balance sheet, separate from its bitcoin trading feature in Cash App.

In a bitcoin investment white paper, Square explained the purchase: “Given the rapid evolution of cryptocurrency and unprecedented uncertainty from a macroeconomic and currency regime perspective, we believe now is the right time for us to expand our largely USD-denominated balance sheet and make a meaningful investment in bitcoin.”

Story continues

At the time of purchase on Oct. 7, bitcoin was trading near $11,000—now it’s trading near $16,000. One year ago, some analysts still saw CEO Jack Dorsey’s bitcoin obsession as a potential problem for the company; right now, his bitcoin bets look pretty smart.

Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell, in a note on Friday, called it a “dream quarter” for Square and wrote that “CEO Jack Dorsey's forays into bitcoin and equity investing via Cash App are proving to be masterstrokes for the company.”

Square’s big Q3 earnings report came one week after Twitter, Jack Dorsey’s other company, delivered a very different Q3 earnings report.

Twitter (TWTR) beat expectations on revenue and earnings per share, but added merely 1 million new daily active users in Q3 from the quarter before, sending its shares tumbling. That paltry user growth also renewed scrutiny of Dorsey’s future as CEO. Twitter then announced that an “independent panel,” including Jesse Cohn of activist hedge fund Elliott Management, has expressed its confidence in Dorsey’s leadership, suggesting he will remain CEO—for now. Twitter shares are up 34% in 2020.

While Dorsey’s future at the helm of Twitter is uncertain, his stewardship of Square has, by contrast, been extremely successful over the past few years. (Square was Yahoo Finance’s Company of the Year in 2018.) Square shares are up 220% in 2020.

AP News today declared that Joe Biden had won the U.S. elections. Bitcoin dropped shortly after the news, signaling the market’s initial concerns about the President-elect.

Bitcoin Bearish on Biden

President Trump has yet to concede the election, but news agencies worldwide have declared Biden the victor of the Presidential election.

Biden nabbed 284 electoral votes. Only 270 are needed to claim victory.

America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me. pic.twitter.com/moA9qhmjn8 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 7, 2020

Shortly after the news, Bitcoin had dipped below $15,200 after a strong run to new yearly highs this week.

What Will Happen to Wall Street and Crypto

Since Biden won’t have control over both the House and Senate, the coronavirus stimulus package will likely come later and be smaller. Along with it, tougher tax policy and corporate reforms will be off the table, which is beneficial for Wall Street.

On top of that, Wall Street spent more money to support Biden’s campaign than it paid to promote Trump. It seems the investment industry is fine with Biden being the president.

Some of the crypto community members are pro-Biden too. For instance, one of the largest crypto derivatives exchanges, FTX, donated over $5 million to help Biden win.

The impact of Biden’s presidency on the financial sector and crypto will largely depend on his and his team’s stance.

Joe himself was one of the targets of the recent massive Twitter hack, which involved asking people to send Bitcoin to famous people. After the hack, Biden tweeted that he doesn’t own any Bitcoin, showing neither a positive nor negative attitude towards the cryptocurrency.

I don’t have Bitcoin, and I’ll never ask you to send me any. But if you want to chip in to help make Donald Trump a one-term President, you can do that here: https://t.co/8XtBjuU5fX — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 16, 2020

However, Joe has a history of getting in the way of innovation. When he was a U.S. senator, he pushed against encryption.

Kamala Harris, Biden’s potential VP, didn’t come with any crypto-related statements, but Ryan Montoya, who is familiar with crypto, is in her team. Montoya was Chief Technical Officer of the Sacramento Kings, which rewarded its fans with crypto.

The new president’s top pick for the U.S. Treasury’s chair is Lael Brainard, a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. In one of her recent publications on digital currencies, Brainard highlighted that the advent of Bitcoin raised regulatory concerns, but she also pointed at the importance of fostering innovation.

Gary Gensler, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman, can also help Biden overseeing Wall Street. Gensler is tech-savvy and has an overall positive stance on crypto, expecting to see it “somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way.”

Andrew Yang, a prominent crypto supporter, also joined Biden’s camp. Yang has been vocal about making regulations crypto-friendly, which may positively influence the regulatory landscape under the new president’s administration.",2020-11-07 16:58:51+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/dutch-crypto-regulation-central-bank/,"39 Firms Have Applied to Offer Crypto Services Under New Regulation, Says Dutch Central Bank

Thirty-nine companies have applied for registration with the Dutch central bank to provide cryptocurrency services, the regulator told news.Bitcoin.com. They include crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers.

Dutch Central Bank Begins Registering Crypto Service Providers

De Nederlandsche Bank NV (DNB), the Dutch central bank, has started actively registering companies to provide cryptocurrency services.

As a result of the implementation of the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), providers of exchange services between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies and providers of custodial wallets must apply for registration with the central bank. They must demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act and the Sanctions Act of 1977.

The 5AMLD implementation went into effect on May 21 in the Netherlands. Since then, cryptocurrency service providers can only carry out their activities if they are included in the public register of the central bank.

A spokesperson for the Dutch central bank told news.Bitcoin.com:

So far we received 39 applications.

According to the public register on the central bank’s website, four companies have been granted registration to offer crypto services. They are Rotterdam-based 2525 Ventures, Amsterdam-based Amdax, Nijmegen-based Blox, and Veghel-based Phoenix Payments.

2525 Ventures also operates under the trade names Litepay, Lightpaid, Lightbit, Litewallet, Litedeal, and Litebit. Phoenix Payments also operates as Anycoin Direct.

“It was with great pride that we received the good news that we were one of the first parties to successfully complete the registration process,” Anycoin Direct CFO Bram Ceelen commented, elaborating:

It was a tough challenge to go through this process. We made significant adjustments to our order process in order to meet the registration requirements.

Companies that were already providing cryptocurrency services before May 21 and have applied for registration before that date can continue to perform crypto activities during the registration process.

The central bank “only supervises compliance with the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act and the Sanctions Act 1977,” it explained. “The registered companies are not subject to the prudential supervision of DNB or the conduct supervision of the AFM [Authority for the Financial Markets]. This means that financial business risks are not monitored and there is no specific financial consumer protection.”

The digital coin rose nearly 9 million percent in price between 2010 and 2019. Simply holding or averaging into Bitcoin (BTC) positions yields a certain profit benchmark. Finding an investment or trading strategy that outpaces Bitcoin's performance can prove difficult, but a financial fund known as Off The Chain Capital has claimed to do just that. The fund has also outpaced the S&P 500, a popular mainstream financial market index, although the S&P stands as a less formidable opponent in terms of price gains.

""It's easy to outperform the stock market because if you look at Bitcoin relative to other assets like dollars, gold, stocks and bonds, Bitcoin is sucking in all the value out of those,"" Brian Estes, the fund's founder and chief investment officer, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin naturally provides greater profit than other mainstream financial assets, such as stocks and gold, he explained, adding: ""The hard part is to outperform Bitcoin.""

Estes created Off The Chain Capital in 2016 as a financial fund open only to his friends and family. A number of years later, the fund began letting other members of the public invest, Estes explained. ""We have over 90 partners now in the fund,"" he noted. ""The reason I decided to open up the fund to outside investors was I finally figured out how to outperform Bitcoin.""

The strategy

CT: Can you explain how the fund works? Such as what is in the fund and what your mindset regarding that is?

BE: What I figured out was that the best way to outperform Bitcoin is to buy Bitcoin below what other people could buy it at or sell Bitcoin above what the spot market is. We found ways to buy Bitcoin at a discount, and we found ways to buy Bitcoin at spot prices and then sell it for above to people who are willing to pay us a premium for Bitcoin — and that's pretty much all we do in the fund. So, we're a value investor in Bitcoin and blockchain assets.

CT: When you buy below and sell above, are you talking more about long-term action or are you talking about short plays?

BE: We don't trade. Our average holding period is over 12 months, so we're not traders. We don't use leverage. We're not leveraging up the portfolio to outperform Bitcoin. We're using a traditional, Graham-Dodd, Warren Buffett value method to buy Bitcoin for cheap.

We're one of the largest buyers in the world of Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims. So, when you buy a Mt. Gox bankruptcy claim from people who have a claim on the company, our average cost is about $1,000 per claim, and we're getting almost $3,000 worth of assets.

Those assets inside of a claim are 0.1785 Bitcoin, 0.18 Bitcoin Cash and there's about $784 of just cash, like currency, in there. When you add all that up, there is about $3,000 worth of value. Like I said, our average cost is about $1,000. These claims will eventually get paid out over the next few years, and when these claims get paid out, even if Bitcoin doesn't move, we're almost tripling our money because we're buying this Bitcoin at a discount through these claims.

Mt. Gox's legacy lives on

Mt. Gox started as one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. The marketplace operated from 2010 to 2014, ultimately ending in disaster. The exchange suffered an infamous hack in which nefarious parties reportedly pilfered roughly 850,000 BTC, leading to the exchange's demise in 2014.

Fast-forward to 2020, and authorities are still sorting through the rubble and aftermath of the affair. Part of the process has seen victims who lost funds from the Mt. Gox ordeal submit claims for compensation for their losses. Entities such as Off The Chain Capital look to buy these claims for profit, albeit in the form of delayed gratification.

Essentially, due to the red tape involved and legal processes around Mt. Gox, these claims do not pay out right away and have suffered many delays. Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi oversees the ordeal. The payout for the claims has seen a number of delays. Kobayashi must provide the courts with a plan of action. Most recently, the proposal's due date was moved from Oct. 15 to Dec. 15.

In addition to the Mt. Gox claims, Off The Chain Capital employs other strategies, although the firm does not divulge these tactics to the public, Estes explained. Off The Chain Capital is not the only player interested in this type of financial play, however. Fortress Investment Group stands as another example of a party that has expressed interest in buying Mt. Gox claims.

Buying Mt. Gox claims helps both sides

Buying these claims also helps the victims of the Mt. Gox ordeal. They can receive compensation for their losses sooner, albeit at a discount, through selling their claims.

CT: So, the Mt. Gox claims: The reason you're getting the discount is because you are not being paid out until the future, correct?

BE: Exactly, yeah. So, we're giving people liquidity. They have a claim, so they get liquidity, and they get $1,000 per claim. What we get is value. We get $3,000 of value, but we get the illiquidity. So, these are illiquid investments until the Japanese trustee decides to distribute the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and currency out. When that happens, we become liquid. We're willing to be illiquid for the return — for a three-times return. That's a good trade-off for us.

It benefits the people selling the claims too because they've been sitting on these claims for almost seven years. Most of the people selling these, they have life events that happened to them. They need the money, so they're happy to sell them and to have someone to sell them to. They're getting married, having a baby, buying a new house or they wreck their car, and they need liquidity.

CT: Is there any idea of when the claims will be paid out? Will they all be paid out at once, or are they being paid out every couple of months?

BE: On Oct. 15, the Japanese trustee was supposed to update the distribution plan. They postponed it until Dec. 15, so on Dec. 15, we'll have more clarity. It's kind of anyone's guess. Some people are thinking six months, but we're planning for about two years, hoping that it'll be a year or less, but it could be another three to four years. No one really knows.

This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/168869-threat-of-quantum-computing-to-bitcoin-should-be-taken-seriously-but-theres-enough-time-to-upgrade-current-security-systems-experts-claim/,"LocalBitcoins, a leading peer to peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchange, notes that with the advent of quantum computing, there have been concerns that this new technology could be a threat to existing online protocols. Some experts claim that powerful quantum computers might become a legitimate threat to the security of Bitcoin (BTC) and the current encryption algorithms that it uses.

According to LocalBitcoins:

“While the threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin is to be taken seriously, experts believe that Bitcoin [and other cryptocurrencies] have time to adapt to the quantum age without compromising [their] security in the process.”

As explained in a blog post by LocalBitcoins, Bitcoin or BTC and its blockchain-based network is secured by cryptographic algorithms, which is why it’s called a “cryptocurrency.” Cryptography allows developers to protect certain sensitive data and communication on a platform so that only the parties authorized to view the information can access it. The LocalBitcoins team notes that cryptography uses several different algorithms, and Bitcoin depends on them to function properly.

At present, these algorithms are “almost impossible to break,” but quantum computers may “spell trouble to these algorithms in various ways,” according to LocalBitcoins.

They explain that the idea or concept behind quantum computing is to “go beyond the power of traditional computers by leveraging quantum mechanics, a field in physics that describes behaviors on a subatomic scale.” They also noted that “when unobserved, subatomic particles can exist in multiple places at once, however, when [they have been] detected, they collapse into a single point in space-time.”

They further explain:

“Traditional computers operate with ‘bits’ which encode either a 0 or a 1, while quantum computers use quantum bits, or ‘qubits,’ which can be both a 0 or a 1 at the same time. This phenomenon is known as ‘superposition’ which allows a huge amount of calculations to be carried out simultaneously.”

They continued:

“Bitcoin’s algorithm most at risk from quantum computing is its signature algorithm that uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) [which] is used to generate the public/private key pair to sign Bitcoin transactions securely (sending and receiving coins). ECDSA uses asymmetric encryption, and the reason for it being secure comes from the need to factor multiple large prime numbers to break the algorithm. Breaking ECDSA and deriving a private key from a public key using current computers would take such an astronomical amount of time that it wouldn’t even be realistic to try it out.”

But with quantum computers that support parallel calculation, this same process can be carried out a lot more efficiently, and multiple types of attacks then become possible, the LocalBitcoins team noted.

They explained that the first one of these potential attacks aims to target “re-used” addresses. When a transaction is performed, your public key becomes visible on the blockchain or a distributed ledger technology (DLT) network. The LocalBitcoins team adds that knowing your public key, an attacker who’s using quantum computers may then use your public key to “derive” your private key. After they’ve determined what your private key might be, they can begin signing transactions on your behalf – which means they can also spend your Bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency.

LocalBitcoins clarifies that addresses that have not been used to send transactions are “quantum-safe because quantum computers can’t ‘read’ their public key.”

LocalBitcoins further noted that another possible attack is the “double-spend” attack. This “measures how fast a quantum computer can derive your private key from the already visible public key.” They pointed out that “if an attacker can do this before your transaction is confirmed multiple times in a block, you are essentially both trying to spend the same bitcoin, and the attacker wins.”

They also mentioned:

“Bitcoin’s hashing function used in the block creation is even more robust in the face of a quantum threat than its signature algorithm. The algorithm Bitcoin uses in its mining process is called SHA-256. When a miner solves a block and receives the right to add it to the blockchain, that miner’s transactions become confirmed, and part of the ledger.”

They further explained:

“To solve a block, a miner needs to guess a ‘nonce,’ or a value that after a hash is applied, results in a number that has a certain number of leading zeroes. As a miner, you can’t start from a valid result and then generate the correct nonce from it. You have to randomly guess it. This takes a lot of computing power and is behind the proof-of-work securing Bitcoin’s network. If the SHA-256 was broken somehow, an attacker could mine new blocks at will and earn all Bitcoin block rewards.”

LocalBitcoins notes that existing quantum computers are only operated in labs and still appear to be a long way from becoming a legitimate threat to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to estimates, a quantum computer of around 4000 qubits would be required to break Bitcoin’s code, while the most powerful quantum computers available right now operate with only about 50 qubits.

Industry experts predict that quantum computing machines may begin to break binary based encryption algorithms within the next decade unless there’s an unexpected mathematical or physical breakthrough before that.

The LocalBitcoins team added:

“When the quantum threat becomes more imminent, cryptography will have moved to more quantum-proof algorithms. In the process, Bitcoin’s algorithms would have become quantum-resistant as well. This can be achieved by hard-forking (backwards incompatible upgrade) the Bitcoin blockchain by consensus among the Bitcoin nodes, so it will be secure from quantum attacks.”

In brief The Wall Street Journal reports that Biden, now on the cusp of the presidency, is looking into tapping Gary Gensler to advise on Wall Street oversight.

Biden’s been mostly mum on all things crypto.

But Gensler—a former Goldman executive and the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Obama—is well-acquainted with the wider world of crypto.

A report from the Wall Street Journal yesterday showed that US presidential candidate Joe Biden is considering tapping Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commision under Obama, to advise on tackling Wall Street oversight. WSJ cites people familiar with the matter.

Gensler taught a course at MIT about how Bitcoin and blockchain could be used in finance. He also penned an op-ed for Coindesk last December, in which he called Bitcoin a “catalyst for change,” despite its being prone to scams and manipulation.

As Biden cinches the presidency, adding Gensler to his roster suggests that pro-crypto regulation could—could—be on the cards.

“Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have already prompted real change,” wrote Gensler in his Coindesk op ed, “and can continue to do so.”

That may be a step up from the incumbent president, Donald Trump, who tweeted last year that he’s “not a fan” of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “We have only one real currency in the USA,” he wrote. “It is called the United States Dollar!”

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

With the small caveat that Trump’s former Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is, uh, ostensibly pro-crypto (he was once involved with the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, though has hasn’t done much more than that), President Trump’s administration has been more or less apathetic about cryptocurrencies.

Gensler spoke with Decrypt earlier this year about the death of the SAFT (a way of structuring an ICO, or initial coin offering), and how companies can’t avoid securities laws when it comes to token sales.

Though Biden may hire Gensler to rein in Wall Street, Gensler is very much of that world—he spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs in the 80s and 90s before joining the Clinton administration as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.

Senator Bernie Sanders tried to block his appointment to chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commision in 2009 due (at least in part) to his Wall Street links. Gensler also served as the chief financial officer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Biden’s team still hasn’t clarified how a potential administration would feel about cryptocurrencies, but the involvement of a crypto-minded advisor isn’t the worst sign.",2020-11-07 16:16:45,,,,,,,,,

While the supply is increasing by about 2.5% a year, “the demand is growing faster than that.” Miller expects every major bank, high net worth firms, and investment banks to “eventually have some exposure in Bitcoin.”

Although Bitcoin’s volatility remains high, Miller expects investors to focus on the staying power of Bitcoin as the risk of it ever going to zero is much lower than before.

At the current market capitalization of over $284 billion, Bitcoin would rank 18th when compared with publicly listed U.S. companies. Only Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, and Visa are ahead of Bitcoin in terms of market cap.

However, after multiple media outlets announced Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 Presidential election, the uncertainty of a long-contested ballot counting process have ended. Now market participants can focus on the first few decisions of the President-elect before aggressively buying or selling crypto assets.

If the bullish sentiment sustains, these top-five cryptocurrencies could outperform in the short-term. Let’s analyze the charts to spot the critical support and resistance levels on each of them.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in a corrective phase within a strong uptrend. When the sentiment is positive, traders view dips to strong support levels as a buying opportunity because it offers a low-risk entry point.

BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The correction on Nov. 7 pulled the relative strength index down from deeply overbought levels, suggesting a shakeout of weak hands. However, the upsloping moving averages suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

As the BTC/USD pair has run up sharply in the past few days, it may consolidate the gains by entering a range-bound action for a few days. Such a move will help the pair to form a strong base needed for the assault on the all-time highs.

Hence, the possibility of the pair remaining between $14,000 to $16,000 for the next few days is high.

A break above $16,000 could resume the uptrend with the next likely stop at $17,200 while a break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($13,793) may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

The correction from $15,956.26 took support just above the 50-simple moving average on the 4-hour chart. The bulls are currently attempting to resume the up-move but have hit a wall at the downtrend line.

If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to sink the price below $14,000. However, the bulls are likely to step in and buy this dip.

Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line, a retest of $15,956.26 is possible. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend.

ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) is currently trading inside a rising wedge pattern. The bulls attempted to push the price above the wedge on Nov. 7 but failed to sustain the higher levels.

ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground and are currently attempting to resume the up-move. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($405) and the RSI above 66 suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

If they can push and close the price above the resistance line of the wedge, it will invalidate the bearish pattern.

The sellers may attempt to stall the rally at $488.134 but if the bulls can propel the ETH/USD pair above this resistance, a rally to $520 and then to $550 will be on the cards.

Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the resistance line of the wedge, the bears will try to pull the price back to the support line of the wedge. A break below the wedge may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have defended the 20-EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the sentiment is bullish and the buyers are accumulating on dips to strong support levels.

If the bulls can push the price above $455, the pair will then try to resume the up-move by breaking above $468.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $424. Such a move could drag the price down to $395.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above the overhead resistance at $13.28. This bullish setup has a target objective of $19.2731.

LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($11.36) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $9.7665. Such a move could signal an advantage to the bears.

The bulls had pushed the price above $13.28 but they could not sustain a breakout, which shows that the bears are defending this level.

However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment is to buy the dips. If the bulls can drive the price above $13.28, the next leg of the up-move could begin.

If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, a few days of range-bound action is possible. A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the upside momentum has weakened.

LEO/USD

Unus Sed Leo (LEO) had repeatedly turned down from $1.29 levels in the past few weeks. This shows that the bears aggressively sell when the price reaches this resistance.

LEO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the resistance and sustain it. If they succeed, the LEO/USD pair could start the next leg of the up-move that can carry it to $1.35 and then to $1.46.

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.

However, if the pair fails to sustain above $1.29, the bears will try to pull the price back below $1.23. Such a move could open the doors for a fall to $1.16.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears have dragged the price to the 20-EMA. If the pair rebounds off this support, it will indicate buying on dips. If the price sustains above $1.29, the first target objective on the upside is $1.35.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to the 50-SMA is possible. If this support also gives way, the price could extend its decline to $1.23.

XEM/USD

NEM (XEM) soared above the moving averages and reached the overhead resistance at $0.126 on Nov. 6. The bears have defended this resistance for the past few weeks and they again tried to pull the price down on Nov. 7.

XEM/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the positive thing is that the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 50-day SMA ($0.111). This suggests that lower levels are attracting buying as traders anticipate the rally to extend in the short-term.

The 20-day EMA ($0.107) has turned up and the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, which suggests that the bulls are back in the game.

If the buyers can propel the price above the $0.126 to $0.132 resistance zone, a rally to $0.140 and then to $0.160 is possible.

This bullish view will be invalidated if the XEM/USD pair once again turns down from the overhead resistance and dips below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the bears are aggressively defending $0.126.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls had pushed the price above $0.126 resistance but they could not sustain the bear onslaught. As a result, the price dropped down to the 20-EMA.

However, the strong rebound off the 20-EMA shows that the bulls are aggressively buying at lower levels. They are currently trying to push the price above $0.126. If they succeed, a move to $0.132 is likely. The bears may again try to defend this level.

If the price turns down from the current levels or $0.132, the bears will try to pull the pair below $0.11. On the other hand, if the bulls drive the price above $0.132, the momentum could pick up.

It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”

In the turmoil that is 2020, many market “truths” have morphed into myths. And many trusted investment adages no longer make sense.

One that continues to puzzle me is how many financial advisers still recommend the 60/40 portfolio balance between equities and bonds. Equities will give you growth, the theory goes. And bonds will give you income as well as provide a buffer in times of equity decline. If you want to preserve capital into your old age, we’re told, this is the diversification strategy for you.

Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Low as $14.8K; ETH Options Open Interest at Record High

That doesn’t hold any more.

Diversification itself is not on trial here. Whether you subscribe to chaos theory or just enjoy a balanced diet, diversification is a pretty good rule of thumb when it comes to a healthy lifestyle (except perhaps when it comes to marriage).

It’s the why of diversification when it comes to investments that we need to think about.

Why diversify?

The idea is that diversification spreads risk. What hurts one asset might benefit another, or at least not hurt it quite so much. An asset could have unique value drivers that set its performance apart. And a position in low-risk, highly liquid products allows investors to cover contingencies and to take advantage of other investment opportunities when they arise.

Related: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy

All that still largely holds. What needs to be questioned are the assumptions that diversification should be spread between equities and bonds.

One of the main reasons for the equity/bonds allocation split is the need to hedge. Traditionally, equities and bonds move inversely. In an economic slump, central banks would lower interest rates to reanimate the economy. This would push up bond prices, which would partially offset the slump in equities, delivering a performance superior to that of an unbalanced fund.

Story continues

Since the crisis of 2008, that relationship has broken down. In fact, as the chart below shows, equities (represented by the S&P 500) have outperformed balanced funds (represented by the Vanguard Balanced Index) in terms of rolling annual performance over the past 20 years.

Why? First, central banks no longer have interest rates in their recession-fighting toolbox. While negative rates are possible, they are unlikely to reanimate the economy enough to turn around a stock market falling on recession expectations.

And, as we have seen this year, the stock market can keep rising even in an economic slump. Driven by lower interest rates and a flood of new money chasing assets, equity valuations became untethered from expected earnings a while ago.

So, there’s no reason to expect equities to have a pronounced down year, and no reason to expect bonds to rise when they do, as long as central banks maintain their current policies. And it is difficult to see how they can exit their current strategies without causing significant harm to borrowers (including governments). Where, then, is the hedge?

Another reason to hold a portion of bonds in portfolios is to have a guaranteed income. That has been taken off the table by record low interest rates. And as for the “safe” aspect of government bond holdings, the sovereign debt/GDP ratio is at all-time highs. No one expects the U.S. government to default on its debt – but that is more a question of trust than financial principle. Continuity of trust is perhaps another assumption that needs examining.

You might have heard this before: Government bonds used to provide risk-free interest. Now they provide interest-free risk.

So, why are financial advisers still recommending a bond/equities balance?

Why hedge?

Another potential reason is as a hedge against volatility. In theory, equities are more volatile than bonds as their valuation depends on a higher number of variables. In practice, however, bonds are often more volatile than equities, as this graph of the 30-day volatilities of the TLT long-term bond index and the S&P 500 shows:

So, the justification of the 60/40 equity/bond split no longer has a meaningful argument to stand on, either as an income provider or as a hedge. Even just adjusting the ratio is missing the point. The underlying vulnerabilities for stocks and bonds now overlap.

What’s more, there’s no reason to expect things to go back to the way they were. Even without a divided government in the U.S., it will be difficult to implement sufficient fiscal expansion to keep the economy afloat on a sustained basis. It is more likely that expansionary monetary policy will become the new normal. This will keep bond yields down, equity prices stable or rising, and deficits ballooning.

This raises the question: What should a portfolio hedge for?

The traditional mix hedged against the business cycle: In years of economic growth, equities did well, and in years of contraction, bonds stepped in. Only, the business cycle no longer exists. The signals that interest rates used to send have been overridden by central banks, which means that investment managers that still believe in business cycles are flying blind.

What is the biggest investment risk faced by savers of today?

It’s currency debasement. Expansionary monetary policy in the past has counted on the resulting economic growth to absorb the new money supply. The numerator (GDP) and the denominator (amount of money in circulation) grow together, so that each monetary unit will at the least hold its value. Now, new money is flooding the economy just to keep it afloat. The numerator remains flat (or even declines) while the denominator shoots up. The value of each monetary unit falls.

A falling base currency hits the values of both equities and bonds in long-term portfolios. Savers are less wealthy in terms of purchasing power than they once were. The 60/40 allocation split has not helped them.

In an environment where currency debasement looks increasingly certain, a new type of portfolio hedge is needed.

In this situation, the ideal hedging vehicles are assets that are immune to monetary policy and economic fluctuations: Assets that don’t depend on earnings for their valuation, and whose supply cannot be manipulated.

Gold is one such asset. Bitcoin is another, with an even more inelastic supply.

This has been boldly stated by the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Michael Saylor (CEO of MicroStrategy), Jack Dorsey (CEO of Square) and others, who have included bitcoin in their portfolios and treasuries, betting on its future value as a debasement hedge. The idea isn’t new.

But what is bewildering is that most professional managers and advisers still recommend the bonds/equities split, when it doesn’t make sense any more. The fundamentals have moved on, yet most portfolios are still hanging on to an out-of-date formula.

Now, I’m not recommending an investment in bitcoin, per se. (Nothing in this newsletter is ever investment advice.) The point I’m trying to make is that investors and advisers need to question old assumptions in the face of a new reality. They need to rethink what hedging means, and what risks their clients really are facing long-term. Not doing so is financially irresponsible.

It’s understandable that in times of uncertainty, we cling to old rules. With so much change, we instinctively reach for the comfort of the familiar. Yet it is precisely when things cease to make sense that assumptions need to be questioned. In modern times, there has rarely been as much uncertainty about so many fundamental pillars of progress as now. In these times, the roles of professional investors and financial advisers are more crucial than ever, as savers urgently need not only guidance but also protection.

It is, therefore, increasingly imperative that we rethink portfolio management strategies, even for conservative profiles. There is more than just returns at risk if we don’t.

Approaching adulthood

Genesis (owned by DCG, the parent of CoinDesk) has issued its Digital Asset Market Report for Q3, which shows a strong growth in lending and trading volumes, and highlights an interesting industry shift.

The lending operation added $5.2 billion of new loan originations, more than double Q2’s figure of $2.2 billion, with growth coming mainly from loans in ETH, cash and altcoins – BTC as a percentage of loans outstanding dropped from 51% to 41%. The number of unique institutional lenders grew by 47% in Q3 vs. Q2.

Spot trading volumes increased approximately 14% from Q2, with a notable upward trend in electronic executions, and bilateral derivatives volume hit over $1 billion in volume in the derivative desk’s first full quarter.

These figures outline two trends:

1) Growing institutional interest in crypto assets other than bitcoin, largely driven by the yields available on DeFi protocols. These are still generally too illiquid to withstand significant institutional interest, but the experimentation going on in the field as well as on the part of investors points to the eventual emergence of innovative services and strategies that can handle greater volumes with controlled risk.

2) The continued development of increasingly sophisticated crypto trading and investment strategies from institutional investors. This highlights that the crypto asset market is growing up, which will bring in more institutional money, which in turn will incentivize further product and service development from Genesis and others. This virtuous circle is propelling the market to where it should be: a liquid and sophisticated alternative asset market that is poised to influence how professional investors approach asset allocation more broadly.

The report also revealed Genesis is working on a suite of products and services designed to boost the flow of institutional funds into and around the crypto market: a lending API that will allow deposit aggregators to earn yield, capital introduction and fund administration, and agency trading. These, together with the Q3 introduction of custody services, will further consolidate its growing network of market investors and infrastructure participants.

This could point to growing consolidation in the crypto markets: the emergence of one-stop shops that aim to help clients with all aspects of crypto asset management. One often-cited barrier to crypto investment is the fragmentation in the industry, and the relative complications involved in taking a position in crypto assets. Smoothing these obstacles will make it easier for professional investors to take tentative steps into the space, and the access to liquidity could encourage some to make big statements.

Genesis will not be alone in this drive, and we could see a race from other known names to add to their stable of institutional-facing services. This could result in a flurry of M&A activity, as well as more strategic hires from traditional markets. Either way, the industry benefits from the added experience, and a maturing market infrastructure.

Anyone know what’s going on yet?

This week will no doubt go down in history as one of the more surreal when it comes to events driving markets.

First, Tuesday was the longest day I can remember. In fact, at time of writing, it feels like Tuesday isn’t over yet.

Second, stocks seem to love uncertainty. Who knew.

Third, the bitcoin price is defying gravity at a particularly confusing time, adding election outcomes and political uncertainty to the potential narratives that the market loves to grasp at.

Bitcoin’s performance this week has cemented its position in the pantheon of stellar outperformers of the year. The S&P 500 is putting on a good show though – note how its spurt in November accounts for most of its positive performance so far this year.

CHAIN LINKS

Veteran investor Bill Miller, the chief investment officer of Miller Value Partners, revealed in an interview on CNBC this week that his MVP1 hedge fund had half of its investments in bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Yet another respected name cites inflation concerns as one of the reasons professional investors should be looking at bitcoin. Another factor can be seen in Miller’s statement that the risks of bitcoin going to zero are “lower than they’ve ever been before.” He’s talking about asymmetric risk: the probability that bitcoin will go to $0 (a loss of 100%) is much less than the probability it will provide a return of 200% or more.

As if proof were needed that this bitcoin rally is very different from the last one in 2017, the last time the BTC price was above $15,000, Google searches for “bitcoin” were also soaring. TAKEAWAY: This implies that the hype this time around is more muted (in spite of the hubris on Crypto Twitter). It also suggests that fewer “newbies” are coming into the market – the buyers that are pushing the price of bitcoin up don’t need to Google it, which means that they’re not attracted just by the performance.

Square reported $1.63 billion of revenue and $32 million of gross profit from the Cash App bitcoin service in 2020 Q3, according to an investor letter published this week. This is a growth of up approximately 1,000% and 1,400% year-on-year, respectively. TAKEAWAY: Sales of bitcoin in Cash App earn Square a little under 2% in profit, which is a very thin margin compared to Square’s overall business, which runs at much higher margins. But the strong growth indicates a substantial increase in retail demand for bitcoin, which could in part explain the growth in BTC addresses and, of course, the price momentum.

Fidelity Digital Assets (FDA) is hiring over 20 engineers. In a post, the company said it was working on improving existing bitcoin custody and execution services, and building new products. TAKEAWAY: This hiring push hints at expansion plans for their digital asset services, which, given the reach of FDA’s platform, could broaden the onramp for institutional investors.

We published a special series of articles and op-eds related to our Bitcoin for Advisors event on Nov. 9-10, all of which are worth a read:

This newsletter has not focused much on ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, because it lags bitcoin in terms of market cap, liquidity, derivatives and number of onramps. Its infrastructure is maturing, though, and it is undergoing significant technological changes that will impact its value proposition. What’s more, it could act as a good diversifier for a crypto asset allocation in portfolios. So far this year, it has significantly outperformed bitcoin (220% vs 117%).

If you’re wondering what the switch to Ethereum 2.0 is all about, and what impact it could have on the price and liquidity of ETH, check out our in-depth explainer report.

Ethereum 2.0’s deposit contract is now live, marking a “point of no return” for the network’s migration to a proof-of-stake blockchain which aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. The genesis time for Eth 2.0 is now set for Dec. 1, if 16,384 validators have deposited funds equivalent to 524,288 ether into the contract by then. TAKEAWAY: The deposit contract allows for the staking of 32 ETH on the new chain, which will offer annualized returns of up to 20% and will act as a one-way bridge between the current chain and the new one. Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin has already sent 3,200, for 100 deposit contracts.

Crypto asset platform FTX has said that they will launch a derivative based on staked ETH (called “Beacon chain ether,” or BETH), which could act as a claim on Beacon ETH when withdrawals are enabled next year. TAKEAWAY: This is just a hint of the innovation to come as new products and use cases emerge. It could also enhance interest in staked ETH, as it in theory offers liquidity to those participating, and removes the illiquidity barrier for some investors.

Miners’ income from processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain more than halved in October as the mania for decentralized finance cooled and transaction fees fell by over 60%. TAKEAWAY: This drop in fees may not be such good news for the miners, but it is good for the Ethereum network, as it indicates that congestion is receding. We covered this and other congestion indicators in our Monthly Review, October 2020, which you can download for free here.

Allowing customers to trade Bitcoin for cash, and vice versa, the machine saw $10,000 in BTC transacted on its first day.

Now that we are a month away from the end of 2020, the estimated number of crypto ATMs around the world that allow customers to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins for cash is about 11,665 ATMs, according to CoinATMRadar.

This reflects a remarkable rise in the number of crypto ATMs compared to last year. The number of crypto ATMs at the end of 2019 was estimated at 6372 machines; now, as we near bidding farewell to 2020, there has been a nearly 80% increase.

CoinATMRadar also shows that the number of crypto ATMs is constantly increasing by an average of 23 machines every day, or nearly one new ATM per hour.

The United States recorded the fastest spread in the world of crypto ATMs, and it acquired the largest share of crypto ATMs within its territory. The number of crypto ATMs located in the United States increased from 4,213 ATMs in 2019 to 9242 ATMs in 2020, an increase of more than 50%. The United States currently accounts for about 79.2% of the total number of crypto ATMs in the world.

There is also a growing diversity of the spread of crypto ATMs within the United States, with locations in small shops, shopping centers, transportation hubs, and even one in the Tesla Gigafactory.

Rounding out the top five is Canada, ranked second with 880 ATMs; the United Kingdom at third with 268 machines; Hong Kong in fourth with 62 machines; and finally Colombia, which recently showed great interest in establishing crypto ATMs with 59 machines.

As for Africa, South Africa occupied the leadership of the continent with 6 machines, but it should be careful, as Nigeria, the largest economy in the continent, has shown growing interest over the last year.

At the level of companies that manufacture crypto ATMs, Genesis Coin ranked first in the world, with the San Francisco-based company spreading 4000 crypto ATMs around the world, followed by General Bytes with 3442 ATMs.

The significant growth in the number of crypto ATMs in 2020 demonstrates the growing interest from both retail buyers and financial institutions, including financial behemoth Paypal.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/168891-binance-predicts-that-centralized-crypto-exchanges-will-eventually-be-replaced-by-more-decentralized-or-non-custodial-trading-platforms/,"Binance, the world’s largest digital asset exchange, has noted in its weekly crypto market report that for most of the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) had been trading between the relatively tight $13,300 and $13,900 range. But then, over the span of just 48 hours, the flagship cryptocurrency rallied, first surging past the $14,000 threshold on Thursday (November 5, 2020).

Bitcoin then soared past the $15,000 mark on Friday (November 6, 2020). The leading cryptocurrency’s peak of $15,900 this week was notably the highest that Bitcoin has reached since January 2018, Binance confirmed in its report. The exchange pointed out that the last time Bitcoin was trading at $15,500+ was in the middle of the crypto bubble back in late 2017 and early 2018.

Binance further noted:

“Bitcoin’s bullish run rubbed off on most of the altcoin market as well. Ethereum rose from $380 to above $400 on Monday and then again on Thursday, before mirroring Bitcoin’s 48-hour climb to end the week at $440, a two-month high. However, not all altcoins benefited from Bitcoin’s record rise. Binance Coin (BNB) saw sideways price movement this week, descending from $28.50 as low as $26 on Thursday, before recovering slightly to $29 to close the week.”

The exchange added:

“The cryptocurrency industry’s total market capitalization started the week at $390 billion, with a sideways movement throughout the week, before starting to pump on Wednesday and reaching $446 billion on Friday, the highest point since May 2018.”

While sharing other crypto market updates in its report, Binance noted that it managed to recover more than $344,000 from the Wine Swap exit scam. The Binance Security team reportedly helped “recover 99.9% of an estimated $345,000 worth of funds stolen as the result of an exit scam.”

Earlier this week, Binance posted an article titled: All in on DeFi: Why the Days of Centralized Exchanges Are Numbered.

The article states:

“DeFi, or decentralized finance, finally found its footing this year, with numerous DeFi tokens and protocols gaining widespread traction amongst crypto users. Powered by smart contract technology, innovations like yield farming have allowed everyday users to earn unprecedented interest on their crypto assets.”

It also mentioned:

“It seems we’ve already reached ‘the turning point’ when it comes to DeFi adoption. After all, the enduring appeal of financial self-custody and decentralization is central to the original promise of blockchain technology. It has the capability of increasing the freedom of money for all who participate, bringing financial opportunities to more people than ever before.”

The article, which was authored by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, concluded:

“As such, DeFi provides the terminal trajectory for the future of crypto. However, it will need help from CeFi platforms, which will be, for many users, the gateway through which they access DeFi for the first time. We believe the future of the industry lies in decentralization, and with the momentum increasing, it’s time to go all in.”

The service is expected to be fully rolled out early next year.

The company’s goal “to increase consumer understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency,” as stated in its press release, seems to be a needed step in cryptocurrency popularization. Mainstream awareness of crypto still remains very low. As data from a Statista survey indicates, Bitcoin (BTC) use in countries with developed economies is below 10%, with the lowest levels in Sweden, Denmark and Japan. Meanwhile, some optimistically predict that this number will grow to 90% of the U.S. population by 2030.

PayPal’s president and CEO, Dan Schulman, said that “The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly."" Similarly, the former prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, told the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2018 that cryptocurrencies were the “inevitable future of money.”

Related: PayPal’s baby steps into crypto aren't dampening the hype for adoption

PayPal will begin by offering its services for users with Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and the company has acquired from the New York State Department of Financial Services what it claims to be a “first-of-its-kind” conditional BitLicense — a license required to operate a digital currency business in New York — and partnered with United States-based stablecoin operator Paxos to enable this service for its customers.

Considering that PayPal had a reported 346 million active users in the second quarter of 2020 — a figure that has since increased in the third quarter to 361 million, according to its latest quarterly report — the decision to offer its customers services related to cryptocurrencies seems to be a significant step toward mainstream adoption. Last year, Cointelegraph asked experts in the crypto and blockchain industries for their opinions on crypto mass adoption. This time, the question was: Could PayPal’s recent announcement of beginning to offer crypto payments possibly force the mass adoption of crypto?

Cristina Dolan, founder and CEO of InsideChains and vice chair of the MIT Enterprise Forum:

“This is a very exciting announcement that will help increase crypto adoption for traditional value transfer or payments by offering an easy and integrated solution for the 346 million active PayPal users. The most challenging part of utilizing crypto for payments is the on-and-off ramp from the crypto blockchain networks using keypairs to make a payment or a transfer. Reducing that friction at the transaction point will make it easier to integrate it into simple value transfer use cases, therefore making it less intimidating. This may even increase the velocity of crypto and Bitcoin spending across the network while increasing its perceived usability and value as a currency, not just a store of value. PayPal dominates payments processing, yet integrating crypto may also attract new customers.”

Dominik Schiener, co-founder of the IOTA Foundation:

“Since there is no change to the merchant end of these transactions, right now the adoption would be on the user end. PayPal adding crypto as an option for users does speak to a future in which both ends of the transaction are engaged in crypto, which is very exciting for our adoption. This will eventually lead to mass adoption as well as a new method of payments between not just users and merchants but smart devices and smart cities. As more payments platforms accept crypto, we will see that awareness grow into increased interconnectivity with IoT technology. Eventually, crypto will become a part of our daily lives as more companies use it for things like machine-to-machine payments, or our cars utilizing autonomous payments for tolls, charging and other services. Crypto transactions offer more options for touchless payments, in which our devices will handle the end-to-end transaction and we can keep our cards in our wallets.”

Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx:

“PayPal’s move into offering cryptocurrency services is extremely bullish for the space; however, it does not in itself signal instant mass adoption of them. What we are seeing, which is a very key sea change, is the normalization of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and their legitimization by institutions and large household companies. Paypal will start offering these services to its U.S. customers, but with some 350 million customers around the world, this is a big step toward greater awareness and acceptance. Of course, it does not mean that everyone will rush out and buy Bitcoin, but as it gradually becomes more accepted, particularly against the backdrop of an economic crisis in which fiat currencies are losing their purchasing power, more entrants will naturally come to the market. I think that many payments giants and tech companies like PayPal are also seeing the way that things are going and that they need to join it or get run over by it. I expect that the trend to come, and as we move into 2021, will be for more companies like PayPal, fintechs, hedge funds, brokers and banks to offer cryptocurrency services, whether that is the ability to purchase it or offering custodial services. All in all, the outlook is very promising, but we may have a while to wait until we can say that ‘mass adoption’ has been achieved.”

Jimmy Song, instructor at Programming Blockchain:

“The only thing that ‘forces’ Bitcoin adoption is the collapse of fiat money, which isn’t happening yet. PayPal’s announcement gives people an additional path to buying Bitcoin to store value or buying altcoins to gamble — that’s it.”

Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics:

“Yes. This move is likely a huge boon for the adoption of cryptocurrencies in real-world payments. Millions of people who prefer to pay with crypto are always looking for new vendors that accept them. PayPal is now effectively adding 22 million merchants to that list as well as opening the door for its over 300 million active customers. The immediate effects might be diminished, depending on the level at which PayPal allows customers to transfer crypto in and out of its site. However, in the long run, users will come to understand the vast advantages of using digital assets and realize that they can now transfer value without the need of any third party. So, in a way, PayPal is sowing the seeds of its own destruction.”

Roger Ver, executive chairman of Bitcoin.com:

“Of course, a platform with over 300 million active users helps push forward crypto mass adoption. Of the four cryptocurrencies PayPal added, it is the most bullish for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin since those are the only two that are usable for on-chain payments at the moment.”

Key Takeaways President Trump's Twitter account was curtained after he tweeted several baseless claims regarding the legitimacy of this week's election

Amid the unprecdented censorship, the popular Bitcoin proponent Pierre Rochard had his account restricted as well.

The events renewed discussions about Twitter's control over the various conversations happening within the cryptoverse.

Share this article

The popular Bitcoin influencer Pierre Rochard was caught in Twitter’s restriction rampage during election week. Though he’s back tweeting at the time of press, the event reminded users of Twitter’s power over the crypto discourse.

Twitter Censors Trump Misinformation

Twitter recently censored a swath of highly controversial tweets from the American President, Donald J. Trump. The President tweeted several misleading and unfounded tweets regarding the authenticity of this week’s election.

For his activity, the social media firm curtained his content with the following sentence:

“Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.”

Despite the gravity of these tweets’ content, many, particularly those in the Bitcoin community, have expressed concern. And in the same week, one of the most influential members of the very same Bitcoin community was caught in the censorship crossfire.

Pierre Rochard Restricted for 24 Hours

With more than 80,000 followers, Pierre Rochard, a Bitcoin coder and strategist at Kraken exchange, is one of the most outspoken supporters of the leading cryptocurrency.

Yesterday, however, Twitter restricted his account. The social media firm cited “unusual activity on the account” as the reason for the block.

Though the reasons are unclear, Rochard stirred division by telling members of a newly-erected Telegram group called “Bitcoin Twitter backup” that it was “mass reporting from Ethereans.” He said:

“ETH bag holders get salty and organize to mass report with false accusations.”

He cited a recent tweet comparing ETH 2.0 deposit contracts with the famous Eagles song, Hotel California, telling his followers that they can never return to ETH 1.0 after staking on the new ETH 2.0 beacon chain.

If Ethereum 2.0 really was an upgrade, it wouldn’t have “Hotel California” politics. — PierreRochard.com (@pierre_rochard) November 6, 2020

Later in the same discussion, Rochard admitted that Twitter explained “nothing,” and that the “‘moderation’ is deliberately opaque so that they can do their thing while hiding behind ToS and ‘algos.’”

He even joked that he was banned because “Kamala Harris reported [his] account because she’s a cop.”

Despite the lack of evidence behind many of Rochard’s claims, the event resurfaced questions regarding the social media firm’s monopoly on the crypto discourse.

Udi Wertheimer, another experienced developer, told in the same Telegram group:

“Twitter is a great tool to learn about Bitcoin, but also gives Twitter way too much power. At any point in the future, it can decide to censor any Bitcoin narratives that don’t play along with Twitter’s future interests.”

2020 may have been a big year for cryptoassets, but crypto’s regulatory puzzle is far from complete. Many major nations haven’t yet introduced specific legislation or regulatory guidance that covers the sector as a whole, while others are taking a step-by-step approach.

According to industry figures speaking with Cryptonews.com, this piecemeal approach is likely to continue into 2021, with major nations and bodies continuing to introduce regulation for one area or aspect of the cryptoasset industry at a time. That said, 2021 might bring a softening in the stance of many nations.

2020 predictions: was crystal ball correct?

Predictions for 2020, published by Cryptonews.com, were mixed, in that industry players suggested some nations would push more restrictive legislation for crypto, while others would seek to cultivate the sector.

While they took a mostly pessimistic stance on what would happen, it seems that most of the regulations or laws that were actually passed this year were largely favorable towards crypto.

For example, China passed a law at the end of May which enshrined the right of Chinese citizens to bequeath and inherit cryptocurrencies. Similarly, South Korea passed new legislation in early March which brought crypto within the remit of existing financial legislation, subjecting the industry to anti-money laundering regulations and other diligence-related guidelines.

The Swiss parliament did much the same in September, passing a law (which comes into effect in 2021) which again formally subjects cryptoasset to existing AML (anti-money laundering) and securities laws.

Certain crypto purists might argue that all regulation is restrictive by definition, but by effectively giving legal endorsement to the space, such new laws might ultimately have the effect of attracting wider mainstream interest in crypto.

2021: softly, softly, catchee monkey

Given that 2020 was arguably ‘cancelled’ by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s likely that 2021 could witness an acceleration in new regulatory actions and formulations for crypto.

Meanwhile, the recent upswing in bitcoin (BTC) and cryptoasset prices will not necessarily give regulators extra urgency in pushing through regulations.

“It is correct to assert that cryptoasset prices have rallied recently, mainly driven by PayPal's announcement. However, the price action has little to do with recent regulatory developments,” suggested Ian Taylor, the chair of industry body CryptoUK.

Taylor noted that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Commission (EC) have been working over a number of years on providing much-needed regulatory clarity for the industry. “Cryptoassets now fall into global KYC [know your customer] and AML laws and the EC recently published its first draft for Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), a comprehensive set of rules for the industry.”

This gradual approach is unlikely to change in 2021, with governments and regulators continuing to take a tentative, step-by-step stance on cryptoasset regulation.

“Whilst new regulations are being introduced (and indeed, there seems to have been an uptick in regulatory introductions this year), they are still largely behind all the new developments happening in the crypto space,” said Erika Federis, the legal counsel at payment provider Wirex.

For instance, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been in the pipeline for some years now, yet it was only October that China’s central bank published a draft law setting out the regulatory framework for the digital yuan, she added.

DeFi, CBDCs, United States legislation

Given that regulators are generally reactive rather than proactive agents, it’s likely that 2021’s regulatory trends will follow 2020 trends in investment and speculative activity. However, Federis warned that we may potentially have to wait beyond 2021 for new scrutiny to result in actual laws.

“DeFi boomed this year, and will be another aspect of the crypto space that will undoubtedly need proper regulation — it will be interesting to see how long it will be until we see any signs of that,” she told Cryptonews.com.

As reported, many if not most DeFi platforms are likely breaking applicable financial laws in at least some jurisdictions.

Federis also suggested that most regulatory activity in 2021 may relate to central bank digital currencies and how these can be made to fit within existing financial frameworks.

Federis also reminded that areas of cryptoasset regulation will vary from one nation to another, according to each nation’s priorities and values. However, with 2020 witnessing a significant shift in how the wider financial world views cryptoassets, she expects most major nations to increasingly soften their stances in 2021.

“Numerous jurisdictions which have previously had unfavourable attitudes towards cryptocurrencies, have given official legal status to them. For instance, Germany’s BaFin announced that cryptocurrencies are officially classified as legal financial instruments pursuant to German law; Russia has recently drafted a bill which gives a legal definition to cryptocurrency, as well as providing guidance relating to trading of crypto, ICOs, mining, etc.,” she said.

However, in Russia, there are numerous law initiatives that might hurt the sector, while at the same time, the Russian government has indirectly got into crypto trading.

2021 may also be the year that the United States introduces a comprehensive cryptocurrency law. This is what the Blockchain Association’s Graham Newhall is hoping for, even if it hinges on the outcome of the US election, which will now apparently result in new regulators being sworn into office in January, as Joe Biden was announced as the winner of this battle with BTC skeptic Donald Trump. (Learn more: The US Election: Pullback Possible, But Neither Trump Nor Biden Won’t Stop Bitcoin)

“But, our view is that many of the issues we’ve worked on over the past two years have bi-partisan buy-in. We think that there will be many opportunities for bi-partisan legislation no matter who lands in the White House in 2021,” he told Cryptonews.com before the winner was announced.

The creation of a consumer-friendly product

While this may have already been apparent in previous years, the overarching regulatory trend in 2021 will be for governments and regulators to increasingly shape crypto into a consumer-friendly, sanitized product. They will seek to remove many of the dangers and pitfalls currently associated with the space, while (hopefully) retaining its core dynamism.

In the case of Britain, according to CryptoUK’s Ian Taylor, “The initial focus has been on economic crime in terms of terrorist financing and money laundering. Recently the Financial Conduct Authority banned the sale of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes to retail investors in the UK. Also, HM Treasury closed a public consultation of bringing cryptoasset marketing promotions into the broader financials promotions regulation.”

This will also be the case in the European Union, according to Erika Federis.

“I think it’s useful to mention the EU’s proposed Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation,” she said. “Additionally, it also looks to ‘implement transparency and disclosure requirements, establish consumer protection rules, introduce minimum capital requirements, as well as measures to prevent market abuse and ensure the integrity of cryptoasset markets’ – all considerations which will bring it closer to the way traditional financial institutions are currently regulated.”

While the sanitization of crypto might be lamented by some, it’s clear that 2021 will see regulators finally recognize that cryptocurrency is here to stay, with their actions being adapted accordingly.

“Not only are regulators discussing the benefits and drawbacks of central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, securities tokens, and the role and potential value of distributed ledger technology within and outside of the digital asset space, but there is growing recognition that alternative forms of value are here to stay,” said Jackson Mueller, the Director of Policy & Government Relations at financial services firm Securrency.

Indeed, Graham Newhall added that 2021 may bring a threshold from where nations will begin to compete in terms of who can provide the most attractive regulatory regime for the crypto industry.

“I do think the macro impression of which countries are welcoming and encouraging for next-generation fintech and blockchain-based services will be an important story in 2021 and beyond,” he concluded.

Bitcoin rallied by 12.69% in the week ending 8th November. Following on from a 5.52% gain from the week prior, Bitcoin ended the week at $15,500.0.

It was a bearish start to the week. Bitcoin fell to a Monday intraweek low $13,207.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $13,006, Bitcoin rallied to a Friday intraweek high $15,888.0.

Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $14,280 and the second major resistance level at $14,805.

Falling short of $16,000 levels, Bitcoin slid back to sub-$14,500 levels on Saturday before a bullish end to the week.

A Sunday recovery saw Bitcoin break back through the second major resistance level to wrap up the week at $15,500 levels.

5 days in the green that included a 10.03% rally on Friday and a 4.41% rally on Sunday delivered the upside for the week. A 4.67% slide on Saturday limited some up the upside for the week, however.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the $14,865 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $16,523.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from last week’s $15,888.0 high.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.

In the event of another breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at $17,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $17,546.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $14,865 pivot would bring the first major support level at $13,842 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$13,500 support levels. The second major support level sits at $12,184.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.11% to $15,517.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to an early Monday morning low $15,424.0 before striking a high $15,608.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week.

Ethereum

Ethereum surged by 14.54% in the week ending 8th November. Reversing a 2.32% fall from the previous week, Ethereum ended the week at $454.61.

It was a bearish start to the week. Ethereum fell to a Tuesday intraweek low $370.50 before making a move.

The pullback saw Ethereum fall through the first major support level at $376.00.

Steering clear of the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum rallied to a Saturday intraweek high $468.98.

Ethereum broke through the first major resistance level at $415 and the second major resistance level at $432.

Falling short of the third major resistance level at $471, Ethereum eased back to wrap up the week at $454 levels.

5-days in the green that included a 9.46% jump on Friday and a 4.30% rally on Sunday delivered the upside for the week. A 3.42% fall on Monday and a 4.55% slide on Saturday reversed some of the gains, however.

For the week ahead

Ethereum would need to avoid a fall through the $431 pivot level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $492.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from last week’s $468.98 high.

Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $500 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of a breakout, Ethereum could test the second major resistance level at $530 before any pullback. The 62% FIB of $543 would likely cap any upside, however.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $431 pivot would bring the first major support level at $394 into play.

Barring an extended crypto market sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$400 levels. The second major support level sits at $333.

BitcoinGlobal is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency trading platform that brings together traders from all over the world to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly with each other, without intermediaries. With over 60 payment methods, traders are free to choose which option is cheaper and most convenient to execute their trades.

BitcoinGlobal pushes the bar in cryptocurrency purchase as it caters for trades around the world with no restrictions. Users can directly spend their native currencies to purchase Bitcoin or USD Tether available on ERC20 and TRC20 networks right on the spot without having to pass through too many restrictions.

BitcoinGlobal kicked-off with the listing of pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and popular stable coin, Tether. The advantage of having these two cryptocurrencies is obvious. Not only can Bitcoin be used to trade on the Bitcoin Global exchange, but it can also be used to purchase merchandise online since it is the most established and adopted cryptocurrency in the world. Meanwhile, Tether on its part can be used to hedge against crypto-volatility for use by day traders giving customers a basket of options to keep their money.

Unlike other peer-to-peer exchanges that offer very tight withdrawal and deposit limits for unverified users, customers on bitcoin global can withdraw up to 2 BTC without identity verification and can deposit an unlimited amount of cryptocurrencies into their Bitcoin Global wallets.

There are more than 7,509 cryptocurrencies in circulation today with a combined market capitalization of about $387 billion approximately across 31,658 markets (Market data obtained from coinmarketcap). Exchanges account for a greater portion of all of these trades—decentralized and centralized exchanges—as there are over 300 exchanges and counting with the top 10 exchanges responsible for over $20 billion of the total market cap.

DEX activities skyrocketed in recent times due to the DeFi market hype reaching new heights, recently surpassing daily trade of top crypto exchange Coinbase but peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges still remain largely unpopular accounting for only a small portion of cryptocurrency transactions in total.

A typical characteristic of all of these 300-plus exchanges is the basic and strict requirement of passing KYC before transactional activities, only a few exceptions allow trade activities up to 2 BTC without KYC.

A few things to keep in mind when trading on Bitcoin Global

Under no circumstance should you release cryptocurrency to a buyer before receiving payment because cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. That is why you need to double-check that you actually received the exact amount you expected from your trading partner.

You cannot send cryptocurrency from your Bitcoin Global wallet to a platform like satoshidice that is capable of returning cryptocurrency to a sending address.

Bitcoin Global team would never ask you to share your login credentials nor request for any specific action on the website.

Safeguarding your account on Bitcoin Global

In order to protect your privacy, Bitcoin Global changes your receiving address after every transaction. This makes it difficult for cybercriminals to use a block explorer to trace and eventually track you down. There is also a built-in two-factor authentication to prevent hackers from accessing your account even if they manage to find your password.

There are times you might want to send Bitcoin or Tether to a particular Address and the transaction won’t go through. Don’t freak out! This is happening because bitcoin Global’s security is at work to protect your funds. If the security system detects any suspicious activity, it automatically blocks transactions being sent to the suspect.

Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws have forced the majority of cryptocurrency exchanges to become more transparent about who their users are, and those who refused have had to limit the jurisdictions in which they can offer services.

In order to operate legally in many countries, many exchanges have had no choice other than to abide by strict AML procedures, and aside from Monero (XMR), swathes of privacy coins have been delisted from most major exchanges.

Recently, regulators have begun to crack the whip and jurisdictions around the world continue to propagate further measures to ensure investors disclose their crypto holdings and pay taxes on their profits.

And this is all happening as the United States Department of Justice arrested the co-founder of BitMEX and the CFTC charged its owners with running an illegal crypto derivatives exchange.

Roughly a week later, the Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom’s top regulatory watchdog, went as far as to ban investors from derivatives trading at all crypto exchanges.

All of these maneuvers are designed to force compliance on crypto service providers, and while they may eventually assist with furthering mass adoption, many crypto ideologues are looking for alternatives to press their case for financial self-sovereignty.

Decentralized exchanges may be the solution

A growing number of investors feel that centralized crypto exchanges essentially operate in the same manner as traditional banks. As a response to this, decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, 1inch, Curve Finance and Balancer grew in popularity throughout 2020.

For more sophisticated investors, decentralized exchanges offering derivatives trading have also become available. Similar to traditional derivatives, crypto exchanges offering the service essentially act as the broker, but the process is marginally different on decentralized exchanges. This is because they utilize smart contracts in place of a broker, and the derivatives contracts are settled when the contract terms have been met.

At the moment, Synthetix is one of the most popular decentralized derivatives exchanges, and in 2020, it saw its total value locked rise to $1 billion before a sharp sector-wide correction led to a drop in TVL and daily active users at the majority of DEXs.

The exchange allows users to create an instrument called a synthetic asset “Synth” that can track gold, fiat and cryptocurrencies. It also allows the creation of assets that track the price of assets inversely.

Platform users can also stake the native SNX token as collateral in order to mint new synths, and similar to Uniswap, those who provide liquidity are rewarded by earning a portion of the exchange’s transaction fees.

Those familiar with DEXs like Uniswap will know that literally, anyone can list a new asset, which, in the case of derivatives, means any underlying asset can be transformed into a derivatives instrument.

These platforms allow users to trade derivatives without the need to deposit funds in any centralized platform, and they are not required to complete any KYC procedures.

While some investors shun KYC and tax compliance, this is a serious matter for crypto service providers. According to Molly Wintermute, an anonymous developer credited with founding Hegic DEX, compliance is more of an issue for centralized crypto service providers, not DEXs.

When asked how DEXs can remain compliant with financial regulators, Wintermute bluntly explained in a unique vernacular that:

“They can’t. this is a new layer of financial infrastructure, not an addition 2 z current financial system. it’s like TCP/IP or FTP, not jst a decentralized crypto exchange. U can’t stop z code or ban internet. unless public blockchain is open & permission-less it’s almost impossible 2 ban decentralized derivatives protocols.”

Wintermute further explained that decentralized derivatives are alluring to a particular subset of investors because:

“Non-custodial trading (protocol/people don’t hold funds as funds r allocated on smart contracts). Verified on-chain settlement (there’s no ability 2 cheaply manipul8 z derivatives & no close source trading algorithms that only exchange owners knows how 2 work/manipul8 with). deeper liquidity (new peer-to-pool/peer-to-contract model might offers lower spreads & better terms 4 users).”

According to Wintermute, the number of investors actually using DEXs is quite small, compared to the total number of crypto investors. To Wintermute, this means the FCA derivatives ban and the recent legal actions taken against BitMEX are completely irrelevant and non-applicable to decentralized finance protocols.

Wintermute said:

“Decentralized derivative is a part of small crypto world. there r 100M+ of crypto holders globally. around 5-10 of them might b actively trading crypto derivatives (globally). i don’t think that FCA ban has opened any new interesting opportunities. nothing has changed.”

After being pressed to elaborate on the chance that the SEC, FCA or other regulators might not attempt to shut down a platform such as Uniswap and arrest its founders, Wintermute said:

“They could probably arrest 1 or 2 CEOs like bitmex founders who have some shady things goin’ on internally but only 2 make everyone else feel fear. they can’t arrest everyone. also compare decentralized derivatives with crypto used 4 dealin’ drugs. these two things r 4from different sides of a spectrum. a toy in case of decentralized derivs & a gun in case of drugs dealers who r usin’ crypto. decentralized derivatives r not a crime.”

Wintermute also appeared to shake off the recent BitMEX scandal, sharply replying that:

“I don’t think that somebody gives a f--- abt DeFi or DEXes. bitmex guys have so many shady things inside that this might b a great target 2 attack while DeFi / DEX protocols have 100% transparency & u can’t take a person 2 jail 4 buidlin’ a website that jst has numbers on it which r transparent 4 everyone else in z world.”

Ultimately, Wintermute believes that “Bakkt/CME & other wall s--- guys r so angry that no one uses their s----- products that they now takin’ crypto entrepreneurs & tryin’ 2 send them 2 jail.”

The anonymous developer then explained that in her view, the “meta game is 2 ban every cool crypto products & try 2 cannibalize on their user base but with compliant s----- products.”

While there may be merit to some of Wintermute’s bold assertions, the arm of the law is quite long, and as we have seen with the now-defunct ICO era, bringing those who violate securities laws takes time.

In 2020, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has risen to $12.6 billion, and data from Dune Analytics shows that Uniswap processed $11.2 billion in volume in October. These massive figures are sure to catch the eye of U.S. and international regulators so it may only be a matter of time before legal action is taken against DEXs.

Decentralized exchanges are a testing ground for layer-two solutions

In addition to addressing privacy concerns and restoring decentralization to the crypto sector, DEXs also provide a sandbox for layer-two developers to play in. As has been thoroughly reported by Cointelegraph, scaling within the Ethereum network has been a persistent challenge.

When the network becomes congested during high demand periods, gas fees increase exponentially, and transaction speeds grind to a halt. With Ethereum 2.0 in perceptual “development,” a number of DEXs have begun to experiment with integrating layer-two solutions to provide users who are willing to forgo the Ethereum network with cheaper, faster options.

Project Serum is probably one of the better-known success stories for a non-Ethereum based DEX.

The decentralized derivatives-based project is built on the Solana blockchain instead of the default Ethereum network that most DEXs operate on, but it is also fully interoperable with ERC-20-based assets and Bitcoin.

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his team are the brains behind Project Serum, and according to Bankman-Fried, the project is designed to circumvent the privacy and safety concerns of centralized exchanges by giving users a permissionless method to invest with leverage and swap assets.

The project also provides a cheaper alternative to the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that frequently plague the Ethereum network during periods of high traffic.

Bankman-Fried said:

“In order to build a product capable of offering fast, cheap order matching, you need a chain with high throughput. This demand increases further for trading nonstandard markets and handling risk or liquidations. Serum chose to build on Solana because the chain has focused on a unique and powerful vision for scaling.”

According to Bankman-Fried, technical issues such as congestion and high fees can make or break an investor. Regarding high fees, he said:

“They’re fatal: You basically cannot have derivatives on Ethereum because of the scaling problems. To the extent that decentralized derivatives have growth opportunities, they’ll either be on a new L1, or on an L2.”

Bankman-Fried also agreed with Wintermute’s claim that hardly anyone is using DEXs, as “the vast majority of derivatives volume is on centralized exchanges,” but he suggested that in theory, “composability and self-custody” should be incentives for more users to join the movement.

One DEX to rule them all

Currently, investors have shifted their attention back to Bitcoin as the digital asset pursues a new all-time high, and data from Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data indicate that DEX trading volume and daily active users continue to decline.

While this is likely disappointing to investors, it at least provides developers some quiet time to focus on properly integrating layer-two solutions to DeFi protocols.

The trend of major cryptocurrency exchanges becoming more centralized is unlikely to change anytime soon. This means that the first DEX to successfully provide a platform with low fees, privacy protections and a fast user-friendly interface will rule supreme once investors make the choice to invest in decentralized finance and decentralized derivatives again.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/s2f-creator-has-no-doubt-bitcoin-will-hit-100k-by-december-2021,"PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, reiterated on Nov. 8 that Bitcoin (BTC) is well on its way to hit $100,000. The pseudonymous analyst expects the dominant cryptocurrency to achieve the $100,000 to $288,000 range by December 2021.

Bitcoin would have to increase by around 545% from the current price to surpass $100,000. At that price point, the market capitalization of BTC would near $2 trillion, or roughly the same as Apple, the world’s most valuable company.

Why $100,000+ and why is it 2021?

The S2F model attempts to predict the long-term price trend of Bitcoin by evaluating its supply. Namely, it takes into consideration its fixed supply and the block reward halving, which reduces the rate at which new BTC is produced or “mined.”

The theory behind S2F is that as the supply of Bitcoin decreases over time and inflation would continuously rise. These two factors could theoretically amplify the uptrend of the top cryptocurrency.

Based on Bitcoin’s supply curve and the halving cycles, S2F puts the expected valuation of BTC at $5.5 trillion. The model predicts Bitcoin to reach a multi-trillion-dollar valuation before 2024. The model reads:

“S2FX model estimates a market value of the next BTC phase/cluster (BTC S2F will be 56 in 2020–2024) of $5.5T. This translates into a BTC price (given 19M BTC in 2020–2024) of $288K.”

In a tweet, PlanB said he remains confident the S2F model’s $100,000 price projection for Bitcoin would materialize.

2021 is particularly important for Bitcoin because it follows a highly anticipated block reward halving in May 2020.

Six months ago, Bitcoin experienced its third halving in history. This decreased the number of BTC mined each day by half, which would cause the circulating supply to drop over time. The analyst wrote:

“People ask if I still believe in my model. To be clear: I have no doubt whatsoever that #bitcoin S2FX is correct and #bitcoin will tap $100K-288K before Dec2021. In fact I have new data that confirms the supply shortage is real. IMO 2021 will be spectacular. Not financial advice!”

So far, following the halving, Bitcoin has increased from $8,700 to $15,500, recording a 78.1% rally in six months.

The supply of Bitcoin is lower than on paper

On-chain analysts like Woobull.com creator Willy Woo say that the total supply of Bitcoin is lower than often thought.

While the total supply of Bitcoin is 21 million, there is a high number of BTC that is lost or dormant that can no longer be accessed. Woo said:

“Total supply of Bitcoin will not be 21m, it'll be around 17m as many coins died in the fight for being acknowledged as something valuable in the early days. This means 0.002 BTC per person on the planet.”

As such, PlanB expects Bitcoin to follow the S2F model as the available supply and the amount of new Bitcoin mined decreases over time.",,https://www.coindesk.com/riot-blockchain-q3-2020-earnings-mining,"Disclosure

The estimated number of crypto ATMs around the world that allow customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and other altcoins for cash is about 11,665 ATMs, according to CoinATMRadar.

This reflects a notable rise in the number of crypto ATMs compared to last year. The number of crypto ATMs at the end of 2019 was estimated at 6372 machines; now, there has been a nearly 80% increase.

CoinATMRadar also shows that the number of crypto ATMs is constantly increasing by an average of 23 machines every day, or nearly one new ATM per hour.

The United States recorded the fastest spread in the world of crypto ATMs, and it acquired the largest share of crypto ATMs within its territory. The number of crypto ATMs located in the United States increased from 4,213 ATMs in 2019 to 9242 ATMs in 2020, an increase of more than 50%. The United States currently accounts for about 79.2% of the total number of crypto ATMs in the world.

There is also a growing diversity of the spread of crypto ATMs within the United States, with locations in small shops, shopping centers, transportation hubs, and even one in the Tesla Gigafactory.

Rounding out the top five is Canada, ranked second with 880 ATMs; the United Kingdom at third with 268 machines; Hong Kong in fourth with 62 machines; and finally, Colombia, which recently showed great interest in establishing crypto ATMs with 59 machines.

As for Africa, South Africa occupied the leadership of the continent with 6 machines, but Nigeria, the largest economy in the continent, has shown growing interest over the last year.

Over 2018 and 2019, bitcoin often languished below $10,000, struggling to recover from a crash that followed the late 2017 surge to record highs near $20,000.

So, what’s behind the rapid gains in recent weeks? Here are three of the primary factors driving the bull market:

1. Increased institutional participation

“Over the past eight weeks, we have seen various notable public companies and hedge funds enter the cryptocurrency market with sizable deployment of capital,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Singapore-based Stack Funds said.

On Sept. 15, listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) announced the purchase of $250 million worth of bitcoins, and three weeks later payments company Square (NYSE: SQ) also disclosed its investment in the bitcoin market.

In October, leverage in the derivatives market was also skewed bullish, with institutions holding record long positions in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

The increased institutional participation likely created upward pressure on prices. Further, it buoyed broader market sentiment and likely prompted more buyers to join the market.

The number of bitcoin whale entities – clusters of addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – rose to four-year highs at the end of October. Retail participation increased, too, as suggested by the “accumulation addresses” metric rising to record highs.

Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, expectations for additional U.S. fiscal stimulus alongside the Federal Reserve’s ongoing inflation-boosting bond purchase programs have triggered fears of a dollar sell-off, and motivated both institutions and retailers to put at least some money into bitcoin.

“The talks of further stimulus efforts has put bitcoin on the map as a quasi-safe haven, possessing many of the store-of-value qualities of gold, despite its relatively [brief] existence,” Dibb said.

2. Supply crunch

Large spot buyers, mostly institutions, have created a shortfall in bitcoin liquidity, pressuring prices to the higher side.

“Between Grayscale’s GBTC trust, MicroStrategy and the influx of other large spot buyers, the supply of bitcoin is beginning to look more scarce,” Dibb said. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent firm, Digital Currency Group.

Further, retail investors took direct custody of their coins by moving them from exchanges to their own wallets, adding to the drying up of sell-side liquidity. The total number of bitcoins held on cryptocurrency exchanges has fallen 9% to 2,404,788 BTC in the past two months, according to Glassnode data.

The decline in exchange balances is indicative of strong holding sentiment in the market.

3. Technical breakout

Bitcoin’s bullish bias strengthened following the cryptocurrency’s convincing break above $12,500 in the third week of October.

Back then, many analysts had pointed to $12,500 as the level to beat for the bulls. That’s because the cryptocurrency had declined sharply following a rejection near $12,500 in August.

“The real resistance level is around $12,500-ish, so, until a meaningful breakout above that level, nothing is done,” David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk on Oct. 20.

Indeed, the eventual breakout above $12,500 looks to have invited stronger chart-driven buying pressure.

Bitcoin ended the third week of October above the key hurdle and remained bid in the following two weeks. Now support, at $12,500, hasn’t been tested since.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann

Crypto crime hit $4.5 billion globally in 2019.

“What we have seen is that exchanges and other cryptocurrency players have implemented more security procedures,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace’s chief executive officer, told Reuters.

“They have taken the guidance and implemented the procedures to secure their funds better. So you’re going to see less mass-scale hacks.”

So far this year, losses from thefts and hacks, excluding misappropriation and fraud, grew to $468 million as of end-October, up 30% from $361 million for the whole of last year, the CipherTrace report said. About 20% of those hacks, or roughly $98 million, came from “decentralized finance” or DeFi, which are transactions on platforms that facilitate lending outside of banks.

The total number of loans on DeFi platforms was $12.6 billion as of late Monday, industry site DeFi Pulse data showed, up more than 200% from roughly $4 billion in August. DeFi sites run on open infrastructure, with algorithms that set rates in real time based on supply and demand.

The surge in DeFi was what ultimately attracted criminal hackers, resulting in the most hacks for the sector this year.

In 2019, DeFi hacks were virtually negligible, CipherTrace said.

“Companies and individuals have rushed DeFi products to market that have not gone through security verification and validation,” said Jevans. “So people are figuring out that there’s a weakness here.”

With DeFi networks permissionless by design, which means they often lack clear regulatory compliance, anyone in any country is able to access them with little to no customer-verification hurdles involved.

As a result, Jevans said DeFi can easily become a haven for money launderers.",2020-11-10 15:10:28+00:00,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-confirms-crypto-savvy-gary-gensler-will-lead-financial-policy-transition-team-2020,"Gary Gensler, a Washington and Wall Street veteran who has closely studied the budding cryptocurrency field, will lead the financial policy transition team for projected U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.

Bitex’s entry comes at a time when several domestic and foreign players commenced operations in India after the Supreme Court reversed the ban on cryptocurrency trade in March 2020

Last week, Inc42 reported on global crypto players such as Cashaa and Coinbase. While Cashaa has announced its Indian expansion, Coinbase is actively planning the same. This, despite the prevailing uncertainty around the regulatory scenario for cryptocurrencies in India.

This week, a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based crypto exchange, Bitex, has formally announced its India expansion. Founded in 2018 by Monark Modi, Bitex has its headquarters in Dubai and has set up another office in Mumbai. Notably, India is the first stop for the company’s planned global expansion.

Bitex’s entry comes at a time when several domestic and foreign players commenced operations in India after the Supreme Court reversed the ban on cryptocurrency trade in March 2020. According to Crebaco Global Inc, a credit rating and complete audit firm for the blockchain and crypto industry, the Indian crypto industry has a potential market size of $12.9 Bn, if the sector is regulated.

“The Supreme Court ruling in favour of cryptocurrency has been pivotal in reinvigorating the latent demand for the digital asset in India. The Indian crypto trading community has been showing a growing interest in cryptocurrencies ever since traditional investment options have seen marked fluctuations in returns,” said Bitex founder Modi.

“As the UAE’s most secure and popular digital asset exchange, Bitex will enhance both safety in transactions and innovation in the Indian cryptocurrency marketplace.”

When asked about his company’s projections for users and revenue from its India operations, Modi said that Bitex is targeting to gain 1 lakh users in the first three months, with 5% being daily active users (DAUs). In terms of daily trading volume, Modi said that based on the company’s UAE experience, Bitex is targeting $10 Mn-worth daily trading volume for the BTC (Bitcoin)-INR (Indian Rupee) pair.

Modi further claimed that Bitex follows the industry-standard approaches for KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) norms and regulations.

Previously, Mumbai-headquartered crypto exchange WazirX founder Nischal Shetty has told Inc42 that a clutch of Indian crypto exchanges has been working with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) to develop a self-regulatory code for crypto players in the country.

However, Bitex founder Modi said that the company is working independently and getting in touch with Indian regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to create a positive regulation for cryptocurrencies.

“We have always supported a positive business environment and believe India is moving towards new and emerging sectors despite uncertainties in current times. With good regulation, India has a huge potential to scale cryptocurrency as a digital asset and also expand the use of blockchain in financial payments,” he added.

Modi believes that market-specific innovation, fully-compliant AML and KYC, a multi-signature wallet, and instant deposit and withdrawal facilities will give Bitex an edge over existing players in the Indian cryptocurrency market. Its Indian platform will give users the option to trade various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and XRP.

To detect suspicious transactions which could entail money-laundering, Bitex has partnered with Trackwizz, a leading AML screen and transaction monitoring solutions provider with a clientele that includes ICICI Securities, HDFC Securities, Zerodha, Bajaj Finserv and NSE among others.

ZebPay To Launch Non-Fungible Crypto Token

ZebPay, one of India’s oldest crypto exchanges, at its quarterly board meeting announced its plan to launch a non-fungible token (NFT), becoming the first Indian company to do so. ZebPay’s NFT has been named ‘Dazzle’ (the name for a herd of zebras). An NFT is a cryptographic token that represents something unique and has individual characteristics that set them apart. Hence, non-fungible tokens are not mutually interchangeable. Owning an NFT is like owning a one-of-a-kind work of art or a collectable antique.

The difference between a conventional (fungible) crypto token like Bitcoin, Ether, or Ripple and non-fungible tokens is its rarity and uniqueness. It can grow in value not just because the demand for it grows, but also because it can acquire new properties and benefits over time. Investors can either hold their NFTs or sell them.”

CoinSwitch Kuber Launches Crypto Gift Cards

Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber has announced the launch of first-of-its-kind Crypto Gift Cards ahead of the festive season. The feature will let Kuber users buy and send cryptocurrency gift cards to their friends and family in an easy and simple way. The company says that this will make for an interesting gifting idea during the season and more importantly help to take the idea of cryptocurrency investments to the uninitiated.

The platform has unveiled a country-specific site and blog to help Argentinians learn more about the benefits of betting with cryptocurrency. It also highlights the features that make Cloudbet a trusted leader in the world of crypto gaming including its 24/7 live chat customer support – in Spanish – to better manage Argentine players’ inquiries.

The operator chose Argentina as the first South American locale in which to launch a local language service based on its analysis of search interest in crypto gaming and bitcoin purchases in five countries on the continent.

Curiosity in crypto gaming has, said the firm, increased along with surging cryptocurrency ownership, as Argentinians seek a hedge against the devaluation of the peso amid stringent government capital controls.

“Given the intense interest, we think that now is the perfect time to dedicate more resources to help Argentinians realize the benefits of betting with crypto,” a Cloudbet spokesperson said. “We intend to give Argentinian players more support and more bonuses to utilize on upcoming events within our casino. Crypto enables us to offer features that traditional operators can’t.”

Founded in 2013, Cloudbet is one of the world’s longest established bitcoin betting operators, with a trusted legacy in safely storing player deposits and processing withdrawals seamlessly on an intuitive user interface. The site also accepts ethereum, bitcoin cash, and has added three stable coins – USD Tether, USD Coin and Pax Gold – in recent months.

“We’ve noted that stablecoins are increasingly relevant in Argentina, where individuals are looking to protect the value of their assets from the peso’s devaluation,” the spokesperson noted. “We intend to add more coins that are specifically appropriate for this market.”

The operator relaunched its site in April to attract a more diverse audience and has introduced a swathe of bold new features including esports, politics betting, virtual sports and easy credit-card coin purchases.

Cloudbet grabbed the attention of industry observers in June with an ambitious English Premier League campaign, under which its sportsbook charged no margin on pre-match bets for all games left in the season. That allowed customers to access the fairest prices – and therefore the highest returns – in the market.

The “zero margin” campaign was an extension of Cloudbet’s long-standing “best odds” campaigns on sports including soccer, basketball and tennis.

“Argentine sports fans can be assured that best prices will be offered on the competitions that they care about,” the spokesperson added. “We’re talking about the best odds on match-ups in the Champions League, the Copa Libertadores, and in next year’s Copa America.”",2020-11-10 00:00:00,https://www.ndtv.com/business/zebpay-to-launch-first-non-fungible-crypto-token-dazzle-2323232,"Each Dazzle token will confer rewards to owners, such as lower fees on the ZebPay exchange.

It can grow in value not just because the demand for it grows, but also because it can acquire new properties and benefits over time.'' Mr. Rahul Pagidipati, CEO at ZebPay said at the launch,

Mr Pagidipati added that this year, the global NFT market hit $100 million in total value and is expected to grow exponentially.

Each Dazzle token will confer rewards to owners, such as lower fees on the ZebPay exchange and discounts from partners such as e-commerce retailers, food deliveries and streaming services. Since they are based on smart contracts built on the Ethereum network, Dazzle NFTs will gain new properties over time and give greater membership benefits to the owners. Generating new tokens from pairs of existing ones will also be possible.

Billionaire’s bitcoin

Billionaire U.S. investor Stanley Druckenmiller, who just weeks ago was said to be shorting the dollar, is long on bitcoin. In a Monday CNBC appearance, Druckenmiller disclosed a bitcoin position significantly smaller than his gold horde. However, he predicts bitcoin will outperform gold in the long run – largely due to millennial and Silicon Valley attraction to the crypto scene. “Frankly, if the gold bet works the bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it,” he said. Drunkenmiller made headlines last week for his bearish views on the U.S. dollar, which he suspects will decline for the next three to four years.

Botched BSV

A protocol change in at least one Bitcoin SV (BSV) multisig wallet has crippled security and led to lost customer funds. Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell found that after BSV developers removed a proven transaction script and replaced it with an outdated version, one wallet manufacturer’s home-brewed hash function has serious security flaws. The ElectrumSV wallet’s so-called “accumulator multi-sig” function cancels transfers if more than the minimum number of keys sign a transaction and, perhaps more dangerously, enables anyone to access multi-sig funds “with too few signatures (such as none at all).” One BSV user, Aaron Zhou, lost 600 BSV to an attack exploiting this weakness.

Legal maneuvers

Lawyers are looking to ditch Reginald Fowler – accused of running a “shadow banking” service for cryptocurrency exchanges – as a client, according to court documents. Fowler and partner Ravid Yosef, who remains at large, stand accused of opening bank accounts with various financial institutions to illegally store funds. The partners’ bank, Crypto Capital, is further tied up in a $850 million black hole of crypto funds that went missing from the Bitfinex exchange in 2019. In October, Fowler considered reopening plea bargain talks. Fowler’s lawyers gave no explicit reason for wanting to withdraw from the case.

Trend lines

CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole examines three major trends contributing to bitcoin’s two-month-long rally. Having peaked at 33-month highs near $16,000, experts are citing increased institutional participation (high-net-worth individuals such as investor Stanley Druckenmiller and publicly traded firms Square and MicroStrategy), a supply crunch (huge spot market buys from retail investors and funds like Grayscale’s GBTC trust have significantly reduced bitcoin supply, driving up the price); and technical analysis to explain bitcoin’s rise.

Regulatory matters

“Regulators are slow and there’s a reason we’re slow,” Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Hester Peirce said yesterday at CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors virtual event.

“We need to have [a] process in place so that we make sure when we’re changing rules people have notice that we’re thinking about changing a rule and they can comment,” she said.

When confronted with the quickly evolving crypto landscape, however, Peirce said the agency could do more to be proactive. Noting it is less top-heavy than it appears, Pierce said the SEC’s five commissioners usually defer to the agency’s staff to approve or disapprove novel products like exchange-traded funds (ETF).

In one such example of this arrangement, yesterday the SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued a letter seeking comment on an expanded definition of a “qualified custodian.”

In response to the Wyoming Division of Banking’s recent decision to affirm the wealth management firm Two Ocean Trust as a qualified custodian eligible to custody digital assets for its clients, the SEC is now asking questions. Traditionally, qualified custodians were limited to banks, registered broker-dealers and certain derivatives merchants, all subject to stringent regulation.

Now, with at least one state granting a public trust company qualified custodian status under state law, the federal watchdog is looking to add clarity to the definition.

Industry publication Decrypt writes: “The SEC’s letter asks for public comments on a variety of questions, for example, who’s been left out of the qualified custodian definition that should be in? Who’s in, who should be out? And, importantly, do state-chartered trust companies like Two Ocean have the same characteristics as banks?”

Depending on where the SEC lands, this could open the door for other public trust companies – like pensions, endowments and foundations, Caitlin Long, head of Avanti said – to enter the crypto fold.

As Peirce said yesterday: “There are circumstances where we have a framework at the SEC that was built in the 1930s and 1940s and added on over time,” she said. “Certainly now that we’re seeing what’s happening in the crypto space, for example, there are areas we are going to have to make adjustments and I do think we should move faster … I’m impatient there.”

BitcoinPoint is the developer of an app that allows people to buy and sell bitcoin, and will specifically be using IDLive Face to onboard new customers more quickly.

With IDLive Face, BitcoinPoint is hoping to reduce the amount of friction in the onboarding process, which should in turn boost cryptocurrency adoption rates. IDLive Face has achieved iBeta Level 1 and Level 2 certification in accordance with the ISO/IEC 30107-3 standard, and is able to determine liveness using the same single-frame selfie that a user is asked to take to verify their identity. As a result, users do not need to blink, nod, or perform any other follow-up actions to prove that they are present and aware while opening an account.

BitcoinPoint is based in the UK, where users can buy or cash out bitcoin at one of 20 agent stores in London. However, the company indicated that it will support withdrawals at a network of more than 18,000 ordinary ATMs before the end of the year.

“The ability to make KYC-compliant customer onboarding as frictionless as possible reduces abandonment rates, which results in more people experiencing the advantages of cryptocurrency,” said BitcoinPOint CEO Benoit Marzouk.

“Identity verification is an important step to building trust and preventing fraud in the crypto space,” added ID R&D Business Development Head Steve Cook. “The ability to secure the sign up process while keeping it quick and frictionless for legitimate users is emerging as a competitive advantage in a space that has been hard for the average investor to navigate.”

IDLiveFace will be integrated into BitcoinPoint’s own facial recognition solution. In that regard, the pairing is comparable to previous ID R&D partnerships. The company has provided passive liveness capabilities for Zenoo, TECH5, and RelyComply, each of which used the technology to supplement its existing facial recognition offering.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Dalio said he expects more digitized versions of government-issued currencies in the future than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for three reasons:

A lack of venues that will accept cryptocurrencies for purchase. ""I today can't take my bitcoin yet and buy things easily with it.""

Bitcoin and other cryptos are too volatile to be considered an effective store of wealth. That volatility also hurts bitcoin's use transactionally because vendors won't know how much they're getting, Dalio said.

If bitcoin or other cryptos become ""material,"" Dalio predicted governments will ""outlaw"" it. ""They'll use whatever teeth they have to enforce that.""

“I don’t think digital currencies will succeed in the way people hope they would,” Dalio said.

What Happened: Former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Gary Gensler has been appointed to lead the financial policy transition team for President-elect Joe Biden, CoinDesk reported Tuesday.

Gensler has studied cryptocurrency closely and earlier testified before the Congress — advocating against comparisons between cryptocurrencies and Ponzi schemes.

Meanwhile, the deposit contract for Ethereum 2.0 has reached over 50,000 ETH or 10% of the required needed to usher in the new update, according to CoinDesk.

Six members of Congress faulted the banking regulator’s stance on crypto custody and stablecoin services, as well as its plans to offer a fintech charter, in a sharply worded letter Tuesday that questioned whether Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks has his priorities straight during COVID-19’s health and economic crises.

Brooks has no business bolstering crypto banking while millions of Americans are still waiting for economic relief, wrote Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) in a letter co-signed by Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Jesús García (D-Ill.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). They blasted OCC’s “unilateral actions” as short-sighted calls they said could put “the entire hierarchy” of dollar-denominated financial assets at risk.

“The OCC plays an important role in providing stable forms of currency. However, the decisions of your agency have the potential to adversely affect banking and financial activities well beyond your jurisdiction,” they wrote.

The letter appears to be the first substantial congressional critique of a financial regulator that has indeed thrown its weight behind crypto. In July, OCC gave national banks the go-ahead to custody assets like bitcoin and ether for their clients. Then, in September, the agency allowed banks to begin offering stablecoin issuers banking services.

Those twin decisions could take crypto banking mainstream in the United States. But, according to the lawmakers, they’re not OCC’s calls to unilaterally make. They castigated Brooks, a former Coinbase lawyer, for failing to consult with Congress and other agencies on his crypto regulation first.

“We also question whether this is an appropriate priority for the OCC in the midst of this pandemic,” the representatives wrote.

Cryptocurrency should not take precedence over America’s systemic banking access issues, the representatives wrote. Around 8% of Americans use crypto. But a combined 25% of their fellow citizens are either unbanked or underbanked. Their shaky financials are deteriorating further amidst the pandemic, representatives said.

“Arguably, the immediate needs of millions of at-risk individuals who have not yet received an economic stimulus check and/or cannot deposit their funds in a bank, deserve greater attention than an effort to increase access to financial services to the “banked community” via mobile phones,” they wrote.

The representatives asked that Brooks explain OCC’s stance on stablecoin regulation and consumer protection by Dec. 10.

Wednesday’s letter isn’t the first asking Brooks to explain himself; Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to Brooks in September, asking him to update the committee with the OCC’s findings and detail the next steps the regulatory agency would be taking. Crapo also called for clear regulations to be drafted around cryptocurrency services in the letter.",2020-11-11 17:12:01+00:00,https://fortune.com/2020/11/11/biden-presidential-win-seen-as-a-good-thing-for-cryptocurrency/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-11-11 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/hackers-scammers-steal-billions-crypto-since-2011,"Since 2011, $7.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have been stolen, according to a new report from Amsterdam-based blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain. The total figure breaks down into two sadly predictable buckets – hacks and scams.

The report found that $2.8 billion was stolen through security breaches, the most popular breach being via a cryptocurrency exchange’s security systems. In total, the firm documented 113 security breaches; the largest of these was the Coincheck breach in 2018, which saw hackers make off with more than $535 million worth of NEM coins.

The United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, China and South Korea experienced the most exchange security breaches. U.S. crypto services were targeted 13 times, topping the list.

Another $4.8 billion was stolen through scams, with Crystal Blockchain identifying 23 prominent fraud schemes.

“We deemed $7.6 billion as the total amount for all the years combined in one sum. Basically a cumulative sum for the last 10 years,” said Kyrylo Chykhradze, a product director of Crystal Blockchain.

In terms of the value stolen, China led the pack by far. The report attributed its ranking mainly to the 2019 PlusToken Ponzi scheme ($2.9 billion) along with the 2020 WoToken scam ($1 billion) that was connected to the PlusToken.

The majority of crypto exchanges that were hacked had insufficient security and low-level verification for withdrawals, such as just an email or phone number.

In the case of Coincheck, for example, the company kept most of its assets in a wallet connected to other external networks. It also lacked multisignature security entirely, which would have required multiple key holders to sign off before funds were moved.

Chykhradze said the main reason for vulnerabilities in the tech is the industry continues to evolve at a very fast pace, and more and more entities are appearing on the market with inadequate and “neglected” internal security policies.

“Their security policies are neglected because these new services cannot (financially) afford to pay as much attention to such security issues, whereas well-established entities are in a better position to ensure and prioritize security,” he said in an email to CoinDesk. “This results in newer services becoming cherry-picking opportunities for bad actors who can spot those vulnerabilities.”

Hackers are becoming more sophisticated

The report’s conclusion doesn’t offer much of a silver lining. It observes that over the last few years the number of attacks have remained high. Even large-scale exchanges, which would ostensibly have better security measures, have experienced breaches. The report also predicts that, given that methods used by hackers have continued to become more sophisticated, attacks will only continue to grow in number.

Chykhradze said they see SIM-swapping on the rise; this scam is industry-agnostic, afflicting cryptocurrency players as well as those in other sectors.

“But what has really changed and developed is the way that these criminals are laundering stolen funds. These entities scrutinize services to understand their [anti-money laundering/know your customer] policies as well as policies related to privacy coins in the service’s offering,” he said.

“Services with lower barriers for KYC or privacy coin entry are better opportunities for laundering. This is another critical point to consider in crypto service security, how do we make stolen fund laundering almost impossible for bad actors?”

By way of solution, a few basic security measures for all crypto exchanges were recommended, particularly when exchanges use hot wallets. One is having proper insurance for special cases, a second is retaining an in-house security team, the third is using blockchain analytics software and last is making sure to have assets in reserves equivalent to the amount of cryptocurrencies in online storage.",2020-11-12 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/169007-cryptocurrency-exchange-okcoin-confirms-it-will-support-upcoming-bitcoin-cash-bch-hard-fork/,"San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin confirmed that it will be supporting the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork (backwards incompatible upgrade) which will take place on November 15, 2020.

“On November 15, 2020, the scheduled Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgrade is expected to result in a hard fork. The network currently has two competing proposals for the chain, Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH ABC). OKCoin is preparing to support this hard fork.”

The OKCoin team further noted that the hard fork will be “triggered if the BCHN chain has more blocks than the BCH ABC chain.” They also confirmed that on November 10, 2020 “80.6% of miners have signaled in favor of BCHN, while only 0.3% of miners have signaled in favor of BHC ABC in the last seven days. However, if the BCH ABC chain has more blocks than the BCHN chain, there will be no fork.”

Hard forks are carried out when a cryptocurrency’s community members disagree on how its protocol should be updated. For example, Bitcoin Cash was hard forked off the original Bitcoin (BTC) protocol back in August 2017. The BCH supporters wanted to have bigger transaction blocks while the BTC supporters wanted to keep block sizes down to only 1 megabyte.

Due to disagreements and heated arguments about how to update the Bitcoin network, we now have many other BTC forks like Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, among many others. But many of these smaller networks may not survive because they haven’t attracted a significant number of users and their platforms are vulnerable to security issues (like 51% attacks).

The OKCoin team clarified:

“Like all network upgrades, access to BCH will be suspended for the short duration of the upgrade. Once the upgrade or fork is complete, normal wallet and trading support will be re-enabled. For this hard fork, the chain with the higher price will inherit the BCH name. No action is required from customers.”

Bitcoin crests higher in bull run Ethereum 2.0 gearing up for December launch FTX lets TRUMP crypto losers hold out hope What U.S. election outcome means for crypto Hong Kong to ban retail cryptocurrency trading Funding spotlight: B2B fintech in Hong Kong

From the Editor’s Desk



Dear Reader,



What does a bumpy transition of power and bitcoin prices have in common? You.

As the power dynamic changes in politics in America, so too does the appetite for alternative stores of value.



In this week’s Current Forkast, we note a possible alternative store of information (pay attention, pollsters) at play as traders around the world headed onto cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX to bet on the outcome of the U.S. election. As most traditional polling repeated the sins of 2016, and once again, missed the mark in some key battleground states — we should consider less conventional means of establishing direction of a political race. FTX became a platform where this became real for a lot of people. And now, as Trump creates doubt in the political transition post-election with accusations of voter fraud, FTX says that traders can hold their position for free until Feb. 1, 2021. But the fine print equally demands clarity for the American electorate, stating: “if, by then, Trump has been unambiguously reelected to the presidency, they will pay out $1. FTX reserves the right to interpret the settlement criteria here.”



This makes sense. Even in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, there are rules. It is unambiguous. Even if there are loud cries and complaints, the rules are the rules.



Just like democracy.



Until the next time,



Angie Lau

1. Bitcoin riding high again

Bitcoin price remains above $15,000. Image by André François McKenzie on Unsplash

By the numbers: Bitcoin — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.

Bitcoin has been extending its bull run past US$15,000, even after the U.S. Department of Justice seized over US$1 billion worth of bitcoin, bitcoin gold, bitcoin satoshi vision and bitcoin cash related to Silk Road, the online black market. An individual whom the DOJ is calling “Individual X” is believed to have hacked and stolen the cryptocurrencies from Silk Road and moved them to a separate wallet in April 2013: 1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx (1HQ3).

In April 2015, the address (IHQ3) sent 101 bitcoin to BTC-e, an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange that was indicted in January 2017. Remaining funds stayed in IHQ3 from April 2015 to November 2020.

Court documents state that the government is aware of Individual X’s identity and the person has signed a Consent and Agreement to Forfeiture.

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?



The world in 2020 is a very different place from what it was like in 2013, and the same goes for bitcoin.



Back then, we were still trying to figure out what exactly bitcoin was going to be useful for. At the time, there was a major attempt to push bitcoin as a payment processor for tech-savvy retailers. Investor money was interested: one payment processor — BitPay — hit 10,000 retailers and crossed the $30 million mark in transaction volume. But while bitcoin as a currency for payment caught some interest, BitPay’s initial success wasn’t anything close to the volume that Silk Road was doing.



As Forkast.News senior editor Sam Reynolds wrote back in 2013, bitcoin was Silk Road: data showed that nearly 80% of all bitcoin transactions were related to the exchange. Naturally, after U.S. authorities shut down Silk Road, the price of bitcoin went into freefall, as the without the biggest retail use case for bitcoin, it suddenly became a whole lot less liquid.”Bitcoin evangelists struggle to convince regulators that there is a lawful economy for the digital crypto-currency, but figures such as this tend to sully their argument: Silk Road was the Bitcoin economy,” Reynolds wrote at the time.



But that was 2013. Since then, the world has shifted its opinion on what bitcoin is useful for, and it’s not retailers. Coinbase Commerce, now the biggest payment processor for cryptocurrency, only processes $100 million a year. For the sake of comparison, in November 2013 bitcoin had a roughly $2.4 billion market cap. Fast forward to today, and that figure is closer to $285 billion.



Bitcoin is now an institutional-grade alternative asset class. It’s not something with a primary use case of buying and selling drugs anymore. This time, when Silk Road, bitcoin, and the U.S. Department of Justice are brought up in the same sentence, it’s not going to signal the beginning of another bitcoin bear market. Times have changed.

2. Ethereum 2.0 gets ready for prime time

Ethereum 2.0’s phase 0 launch date is set for December 1 if certain conditions are met. Image: Duncan Rawlinson (CC BY-NC 2.0)

By the numbers: Ethereum — 2,250% increase in Google search volume.

Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract goes live, and the launch date for phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0 has been set to December 1, 2020 — but only if 16,384 validators make at least 32-ETH deposits each, seven days prior to the launch date. If this threshold is not met, the genesis — or the first block mined for the new blockchain — will occur seven days after the goal has been met.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has vouched 3,200 ETH for ETH 2 staking, which is roughly around US$1.5 million.

The ETH 2 deposit contract currently holds 52,993 ether and needs to reach 524,288 ether before the December 1 launch date.

Almost 53,000 ETH has been staked as of November 11. Image: Ethereum Foundation

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?



The launch of Ethereum 2.0 is going to do a lot to re-establish the protocol’s dominance as the world’s computer. But hopefully it’s not too little, too late.



Transitioning away from the current proof-of-work (PoW) system to proof-of-stake (PoS) will dramatically expand Etherum’s ability to handle scale. As we saw with the DeFi craze of the summer, Ethereum can quickly become congested to the point where it’s not really useful for much else. Hence, the latest upstart industry of new blockchains, like Solana, built with PoS in mind and ready to handle the scale.



But Ethereum 2.0 isn’t without its critics, who have lobbed its way a considerable amount of criticism — particularly about the migration of assets and decentralized apps (dApps) to the new platform. Transitioning to the new platform will involve staking assets from 1.0 to receive the equivalent on 2.0. But the problem that has been identified involves a massive run on the price of Ethereum 1.0 while the assets are staked on 2.0. If the staking-and-transition process takes too long, a form of market convexity might occur where the value of the asset on Ethereum 1.0 declines while locked in place via the stake on 2.0.



DApps will need to be re-written for Ethereum 2.0 given the shift to PoS, and the team has confirmed that there’s not a push for backwards compatibility. Although many dApps will take the effort to make the migration, there might be a chance for other blockchains to entice popular dApps over to their platforms — especially if the transition is chaotic.



December 1 is less than three weeks away, and there’s a long way to go before the threshold for network launch is met. Granted, whales could easily jump in and fill up these virtual coffers without much thought. But at the same time one has to wonder if lack of community satisfaction with the way things are going is giving people pause and hesitation to commit.

3. FTX gives free hope to TRUMP futures losers

By the numbers: FTX — 2,350% increase in Google search volume.

Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX is allowing traders who bet on Donald Trump to win the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election to hold onto their bets until Feb. 1 next year, and if Trump returns to the White House, FTX will pay out US$1. It was previously reported that FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried donated $5.2 million to Joe Biden’s campaign.

@FTX_Official: “Some users have complained about us following the rules, and instead want us to modify the rules to favor their preferred candidate. We have done so repeatedly, giving more and more options to those long TRUMP contracts.”

@FTX_Official: “For instance, allowing people, in the event that TRUMP lost, to pay $0.10 to keep their contracts beyond expiration and win if TRUMP is president in February. However, some users are still refusing to accept the consequences of their decisions and the rules of the contracts.”

@FTX_Official: “As such, we have decided, just this once, to allow TRUMP and TRUMPWIN to be held for free until February 1st, 2021. If, by then, Trump has been unambiguously reelected to the presidency, they will pay out $1. FTX reserves the right to interpret the settlement criteria here.”

Betting on politics is nothing new. The U.K’s biggest bookie, Betfair has been taking bets on big political races for quite some time now. But Betfair structures its offerings in ways only gamblers would be familiar with; a novice might not be familiar with odds structured in a way that places a candidate’s chances of winning in a moneyline or decimal format. What percentage does “1.69” mean? Predictit invented the futures market, expressing odds as a dollar figure. But the high fees have turned off many.



FTX seems to have perfected what Predictit started, with its low-fee, easy-to-understand structure. And the market seems to love it. In the hours after the White House announced Trump had been diagnosed with Covid-19, $2 million in volume traded hands. Similarly, on election evening when Trump won a number of key states and it looked like he had a pathway to victory, the token’s value took off like a rocket, getting close to 80 cents before plummeting back to earth when traditionally Republican states flipped blue.



This is real-time polling at its finest, and a great counterweight to pollsters who have been accused of undercounting the Trump vote. In the weeks before the election, The Economist gave Trump a 3% chance of winning. FiveThirtyEight put the odds in for Trump at 10%. There has never quite been a president quite like Donald Trump, and as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried pointed out, the pollster models just aren’t doing enough to capture the enthusiasm of Trump’s supporters or his administration’s mad dog approach to politics.



Granted, crypto is a male-dominated industry. And markets like FTX open the gates to anyone around the world, not just Americans. The over-represented gamification of the process would encourage whales to treat the market just like traditional investment contracts by making big bold bets based on technical signals. For instance, the market treating Trump-winning states that are traditionally Republican amplified the token’s rally, while early indications of close races in swing states sent it to nearly the 80-cents market in anticipation of those states flipping and the pathway to another term at the White House solidifying. So it was very possible to be placing strategic bets on Trump throughout the evening and come out significantly ahead despite the contract not closing at $1.



Both election prediction markets and traditional polling have their flaws. But as pollsters continue to undercount potential votes and not accurately reflect a nation’s electoral mood, other methods of election forecasting need to be considered — and here’s one way to possibly win some money while doing it.

4. What does Biden’s victory mean for crypto?

Bitcoin prices dropped below $15,000 before recovering after Biden appeared to have won 270 electoral college votes. Image: Shutterstock, Decrypt

By the numbers: Election 2020 — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.

In the aftermath of a messy election that may yet head to the courts, all signs are pointing to a Joe Biden victory. In response, President Trump filed numerous lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan.

As U.S. media outlets called the election and announced Biden as the U.S. president-elect, bitcoin prices dropped to below US$15,000, but quickly recovered above this margin and is currently trading above US$15,400.

Biden became the first president in history to have his election victory logged on the blockchain as the Associated Press recorded it on the EOS and Ethereum blockchains.

Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris’s scheduling and advance director, Ryan Montoya, is the former chief technology officer of the National Basketball Association’s Sacramento Kings. The team is known for its blockchain-friendly campaigns and is also the first sports team to mine cryptocurrencies.

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?



While the U.S. elections might have ended in chaos, it wasn’t the worst possible outcome expected by some. There were celebrations and protests in the streets, but no significant violence. American life mostly continued the next day as usual.



The price of bitcoin is up about 14% since election day, and will likely continue to rise. Why? There are not really any huge regulatory concerns at the moment. The momentum that is making bitcoin an institutional-grade asset within the United States, namely the Token Taxonomy Act and the Securities Clarity Act have bipartisan support and are unlikely to be on the chopping block. Likewise, the cryptocurrency-friendly regulators that were appointed under Trump — Heath Tarbert at Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brian Brooks at Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Hester Peirce at the Securities and Exchange Commission — aren’t likely going anywhere very soon given that cryptocurrency likely would not be an immediate priority under a Biden administration.



In addition, an aggressive stimulus bill under a Democrat-led government could push bitcoin prices even higher. Unprecedented debt and deficit levels are already pushing down the USD compared to other major world currencies as investors grow concerned about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ability to service the country’s debt. But, at the same time, news about promising new Covid vaccines might push capital back into equities that were hammered hard during the pandemic, such as airlines and hotels, or commodities like oil.

5. Hong Kong requires crypto trading to be regulated

Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will require all cryptocurrency trading platforms to be regulated, according to Ashley Alder, the SFC’s chief executive.

The SFC will introduce a new licensing scheme under the anti-money laundering (AML) ordinance for platforms that trade any type of cryptocurrency asset even if not classified as securities in Hong Kong or target investors in Hong Kong, Alder said in a speech during Hong Kong FinTech Week.

It will be a replacement of the licensing scheme published last year, which allowed cryptocurrency to “opt in.”

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?



For the Hong Kong SFC, this is quite a different direction than the direction taken by their regulatory peers at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Hester Peirce, one of the SEC’s commissioners, told Forkast.News in a recent interview that the commission needs to do some “soul searching” on the Howey Test — which defines what is and is not a security.



Peirce has also proposed an expanded three-year safe harbor that would allow projects time to determine if they were or were not a security. This would give projects some breathing room and more leeway to perfect their decentralization.



In contrast, the Hong Kong SFC appears to be casting a wide net and is looking to classify more things as securities, despite some of them only having some of the characteristics of a security. This may have the consequence of pushing projects into markets with more permissive jurisdictions.



When Warren Davidson, a U.S. congressman from Ohio, was drafting the Token Taxonomy Act, he cited the need to move jurisdiction for token products away from the SEC to other regulatory jurisdictions like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — which would better reflect the reality of the product. Furthermore, in parallel, the Securities Clarity Act is also creating a new definition of securities laws to specifically exclude cryptocurrency tokens from what is defined as a security.



In the eyes of U.S. lawmakers, without these bills, the industry would just leave the U.S. and hunt for flags of convenience. If investors in these projects were burnt, they would need to litigate the case in Seychelles or some other far-flung jurisdiction. With these bills, lawmakers have provided a pathway for these projects to come back to the U.S.



Hong Kong is doing the opposite. The reality is, not a whole lot will likely change. While institutional-grade exchanges may now consider the territory as a better place to set up shop, retail investors will likely not be deterred by the ban as they can continue their personal crypto business as usual by using VPNs.

6. Funding spotlight: B2B fintech in Hong Kong

Statrys — Hong Kong, angel, US$5 million

Fintech startup Statrys, based in Hong Kong’s Wanchai district, announced a US$5 million funding round from an unnamed “angel investor in the region. Statrys is a B2B fintech firm that integrates existing payment platforms and forex trading to further the “ease of setting up a business account.” In a statement, the company stated that the funds would go toward advancing intermediate payment technologies, including integration with “local currency accounts and payment cards.” Statrys also mentioned further expansion into the ASEAN region, including Singapore and Thailand. The company’s founder, Bertrand Theaud, is a partner at BLF, a law firm in China’s Southeast region with offices in Shanghai and Guangdong.

We’ve seen over the last few months continued investor interest in breaking down the friction costs of overseas remittances. This can come in many forms, from providing APIs (application programming interfaces) that allow for better integration with SWIFT competitor Ripple, to providing faster payment rails for interbank transfers with RootAnt, or with challenger banks that make their money in other ways.



Traditional big finance is going to need to shape up and get ready to fight its way through the next decade. Investors are going for lean startups like Statrys that have the ability to hit pain points that have customers begging for relief and options.

Bitcoin soared above $16,000 early Thursday morning, breaking above the support level for the first time since January 2018.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has rallied in recent weeks on a wave of market volatility and growing adoption.

The latest uptrend kicked off in October after PayPal announced it would allow users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin. It's broken several key psychological levels since.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin surged above $16,000 for the first time since January 2018 on Thursday as the token continued its climb to new heights.

The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency leaped as much as 3% from its 24-hour open to an intraday high of $16,157 early Thursday morning. It quickly erased most of the gains and traded just below the support level at around 8 a.m. ET.

The rally follows similarly rapid leaps for the coin throughout the month. Bitcoin traded below $14,000 at the end of October but has since broken through several psychological levels amid US election volatility. While the rally brings bitcoin back to levels not seen since its famous 2017 boom, it's still a ways away from its all-time high of $19,665.39.

The reasoning for the cryptocurrency's latest leg up is unclear, but its rally first gained steam in October after PayPal announced it would soon allow users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin. The news pushed bitcoin as much as 8% higher to just below $13,000. Billionaire Mike Novogratz praised PayPal's decision, deeming it ""the biggest news of the year in crypto.""

""All banks will now be on a race to service crypto,"" he tweeted on October 21. ""We have crossed the rubicon people.""

Technical analyst Katie Stockton said soon after that $14,000 represented the next key resistance level for the token.

Once that threshold is cleared, bitcoin prices could double or triple, JPMorgan analysts said in an October note.

Bitcoin broke above that $14,000 on November 4 amid a wave of election-fueled market volatility. It rallied above $15,000 the next day. After a brief tumble last week, the token has resumed its upward trend.

Bitcoin traded at $15,899.56 as of 8:15 a.m. ET Thursday, up 120% year-to-date.

Citing steep demand, the publicly traded payments giant upped its weekly crypto purchase limits from $10,000 to $15,000 at the time and said remaining U.S. customers would get access to crypto in the next two to three weeks. By acting so quickly and raising the purchase limit yet again, PayPal is clearly finding a warm reception for its crypto offerings.

“Due to initial demand from our customers, we’ve also increased our weekly cryptocurrency purchase limit from $10K/week to $20K/week,” PayPal spokesman Aaron Gould said Thursday.

Plans to bring crypto services to Venmo and international customers in the first half of 2021 remain unchanged, Gould said. The service comes by way of a partnership with Paxos, a registered fintech firm based in New York that will handle all crypto custody on PayPal’s behalf.

PayPal’s crypto service initially supports bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin – but only with limited functionality. Some have criticized the firm for its restrictive approach.

The latest update to PayPal enables cryptocurrency – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and the like – holding and trading. PayPal tested cryptocurrency features for a small set of users in the weeks between October and now – now it’s time for all USA-based PayPal users to get a shot at using several digital currencies on the platform. As of yet, cryptocurrency features are available only inside the USA, while select international markets will launch in the first half of 2021.

PayPal users in the USA will be able to use cryptocurrency “as a funding source to pay at PayPal’s 26 million merchants around the globe.” PayPal suggested that merchants will have “no additional integrations or fees, as all transactions will be settled with fiet currency at their current PayPal rates.”

There may be some changes to the way cryptocurrency works within PayPal come 2021. Per the October release, there will be no service fees when buying or selling cryptocurrency “through December 31, 2020.” There would appear to be no fees for holding cryptocurrency in a PayPal account into the foreseeable future.

Cryptocurrencies available in PayPal include:

• Bitcoin

• Ethereum

• Bitcoin Cash

• Litecoin

The features available to PayPal USA users as of today are planned to expand to Venmo “and select international markets” in the first half of the year 2021.

PayPal also revealed that they’d been granted a “first-of-its-kind conditional Bitlicense” by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The NYDFS’s aim is to “continue to encourage and support financial service providers to operate, grow, remain and expand in New York and work with innovators to enable them to germinate and test their ideas, for a dynamic and forward looking financial services sector, especially as we work to build New York back better in the midst of this pandemic,” according to Linda A.

The founder of the world’s largest hedge fund and macroeconomic genius Ray Dalio recently revealed his concerns over governments banning Bitcoin. In response, we’re outlining all the key reasons why this simply will not happen, and even if it did, it wouldn’t stop the cryptocurrency from continuing on.

Why Banning Bitcoin Won’t Happen, And Governments Can’t Stop It

Ray Dalio is the founder and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s most successful hedge fund. His latest work entitled “The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail” dives deep into the failing fiat monetary system and a future where the United States and the dollar fall out of power.

The topic has made Dalio a star within crypto circles, which is why his recent remarks about governments potentially banning Bitcoin, was especially jarring. Dalio clearly knows his stuff, and there is a precedence set already with gold.

RELATED READING | BITCOIN REMAINS THE BEST PROTECTION AGAINST A DEVALUING DOLLAR

From 1933 to 1975, the US made it illegal for citizens to own over a certain amount of gold to prevent gold hoarding. It was done to push citizens increasingly toward paper dollars that were at the time losing purchasing power.

Back then, the law was difficult to enforce, and only a few cases where gold buyers were prosecuted exist. It also serves as an example as to why the situation won’t arise again, the dollar isn’t pegged to Bitcoin as it was to gold when the ban was put into place.

Next, the sheer cost in resources and time required to add Bitcoin to the ever-growing list of “banned” goods like weapons, drugs, and more would be large, and wasteful. And if the “war on Bitcoin” is as large of a failure as the “war on drugs” or “war on terrorism,” Bitcoin will become part of everyday society whether there are wars waged against it or not.

Another reason that would make a war on Bitcoin far more challenging, is because it lacks a physical form. The lack of a physical form and cryptography makes it difficult to confiscate.

No one actually controls Bitcoin, so governments’ only chance at stopping the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency network is to ban citizens from owning it. But as gold has proven, it doesn’t work. Also, time is running out on any chance of that happening at all, the more major companies like Square, Inc, MicroStrategy, and billionaire hedge fund managers put their capital behind it.

Billionaires, millionaires, and corporations, have considerably lobbying power. If companies continue to get behind Bitcoin in this way, and the market cap grows to $1 trillion or more, the impact of a government ban would be too considerable to warrant it.

The reasons could go on and on as to why governments won’t ban Bitcoin, and even if they do, there’s simply no stopping it.

With the law planned to be passed by January, the ministry wants holdings for the next tax year to be disclosed no later than April 30, 2022. The value of the crypto reported will be calculated by the national tax agency based on the prices at the moment of transactions, the bill reads.

Failure to declare the full amount of cryptocurrency owned in a timely manner, as well as not paying taxes on it, will lead to fines. If a taxpayer doesn’t declare his crypto for three years in a row, the punishment will be tougher: up to six months in jail for undeclared crypto worth 15 million rubles (~$195,000) and up to three years in prison for 45 million rubles (~$586,000) and more.

Cryptocurrency miners and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers will have to report deals to Rosfinmonitoring, the agency assigned with preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. The agency earlier reportedly planned to develop its own blockchain-tracing tool to connect crypto addresses with users’ identities.

A previous proposed bill by the regulator sought to ban miners located in Russia and using Russia-based infrastructure from being rewarded for their work in cryptocurrency. That wording prompted fears that mining might be outlawed in Russia altogether, and hasn’t been clarified since.

These amendments, however, are not as harsh as one of the first draft bills, which sought punishment for facilitating crypto transactions in Russia of up to seven years in prison. That version provoked an outcry among the Russian crypto community and even criticism from other ministries.

Mikhail Tretyak, IT expert at the Digital Rights Center, told CoinDesk he believes the new amendment draft, while less harsh than the previous versions, might still scare away crypto entrepreneurs. “Part of the market will go to the darknet,” he said. “Others might choose emigration to the countries with softer regulatory regimes, and people are asking us for help with this more and more each day.”",2020-11-12 12:07:52+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84456/chainalysis-new-service-seized-crypto,"Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has launched a new service aimed at governments and law enforcement agencies looking to handle, monitor and dispose of seized crypto assets.

The new service is being offered in partnership with Asset Reality, a consulting firm that specializes in asset realization services for public and private sector clients.

“Chainalysis is dedicated to building trust in digital assets, and that means helping to detect and investigate illicit activity. As our government partners become more successful in rooting out bad actors, assisting them with asset recovery and realization is a natural next step,"" Jason Bonds, Chainalysis's chief revenue officer, said in a statement.

As previously reported, agencies such as the U.S. Marshals Service have expressed interest in such a product, given its role in auctioning seized crypto funds. The last such auction by the USMS took place in February, when it sold just over 4,000 BTC. The USMS said in June that it was moving ahead with plans to hire a third-party contractor to work with it on crypto disposal.

What's more, the topic of crypto-asset seizure is perhaps particularly germane given that the U.S. government just seized more than $1 billion in bitcoin said to have been stolen from the Silk Road, the defunct dark marketplace shuttered in 2013.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-undo-button-wallet-tool-gives-users-the-ability-to-reverse-ethereum-transactions/,"The 'Undo Button' Wallet Tool Gives Users the Ability to Reverse Ethereum Transactions

On Thursday, November 12, 2020, the blockchain firm Kirobo launched a tool that allows users to reverse ethereum transactions. Similarly to the replace-by-fee (RBF) protocol leveraged by bitcoin users, ethereum transactions can be reversed as well with Kirobo’s “Undo Button” supported by Metamask or any wallet that supports walletconnect.

The two top blockchain assets, in terms of market capitalization, have features that allow users to reverse transactions they sent if the fee was too low or for other reasons. For years now crypto proponents using the Bitcoin (BTC) network have been able to use the replace-by-fee (RBF) protocol, which essentially allows them to double-spend bitcoin transactions with a higher fee. For instance with the new Electrum wallet release 4.0.4, “users can cancel (double-spend) unconfirmed transactions using RBF,” developers note.

Ever since the inception of Bitcoin and the following introduction of RBF a few years later, replace-by-fee or double-spends have always been controversial. For example, the transaction replacement concept has allowed for massive theft in certain instances and many crypto supporters consider RBF a glaring vulnerability.

Despite the concerns, RBF remains and on November 12, the startup Kirobo has just introduced a mechanism that allows people to reverse ETH transactions.

“Retrievable Transfer will be available to Ethereum users from Thursday, November 12,” Kirobo detailed in the announcement. “Initially, the service will be available for ETH and later on all ERC20 tokens, as well as offering protection against sending funds to smart contracts that don’t support deposits. Available to all Metamask and walletconnect owners, Kirobo’s unique undo feature means that individuals can reclaim funds mistakenly sent to the wrong address.”

Kirobo’s announcement adds:

The process for Ethereum is identical to that used in Bitcoin transactions. When dispatching digital assets, a password is entered by the sender. Funds are then released only when the recipient enters this same password. If the password is not entered, the sender can retrieve their assets at their convenience.

“The use of our logic layer finally eliminates the need to send a test transaction, sharply reducing the level of anxiety users feel when transferring funds to a third party,” Kirobo CEO Asaf Naim explained.

Naim also detailed that the company’s Bitcoin version of the “Undo Button” has been “hugely popular in recent months.” Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction fees have skyrocketed during the last few months as well. Additionally, Naim said that Kirobo’s tool will also be supported by Trezor and Ledger in the near future.

The Ethereum version also includes protection against Man-in-the-middle attacks Kirobo revealed as well. The Tel Aviv-based startup says that both bitcoin and ethereum transactions have increased a great deal in recent times. Kirobo thinks that human error will be inevitable and the Undo Buttons will be beneficial to bitcoin and ethereum users.

Key Takeaways Exchange inflow of Bitcoin Cash has surged to 1 million BCH in the last week.

The unpopular proposal for sharing for 8% block rewards with miners is gaining considerable momentum close to the hard fork.

Node operators are choosing the neutral option which will automatically run the longest chain post-fork.

Share this article

Bitcoin Cash holders rushed to exchanges this week, transferring more than $250 million to trading platforms ahead of the disputed hard fork.

Support from BCH nodes is split between 40% and 14% for the competing chains.

Tension Before Bitcoin Cash Hark Fork Grows

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork scheduled for Nov. 15 is driving BCH holders en masse to exchanges, and a lot of them are selling.

The hard fork will birth two separate blockchains—BCHABC and BCHN. The BCHABC camp is rooting for implementing an 8% “tax” on mining block rewards for the core developing team.

BCHN supporters oppose this tax, hence the upcoming fork.

The decision is left to miners and node operators to signal their support, but most of them are undecided.

Less than half of BCH nodes choose to side with a third neutral option—Bitcoin Cash Unlimited—which will automatically run the software for the dominant chain.

Moreover, the network witnessed a significant rise in the support for Bitcoin ABC since the last update on Nov. 5, from 1% to nearly 39% at press time.

The BCH community is bracing for a disputed hard fork. Moreover, businesses such as crypto wallets are unclear on their decisions, while most exchanges support both variants.

Reportedly, over the last week, users have deposited 1 million BCH to exchanges, and the price of BCH has dipped in tandem with the increased inflows. Hence, holders might be motivated to obtain both tokens post the hard fork on exchanges easily.

However, a dip in BCH price relative to Bitcoin is suggesting that many of them are selling.

While crypto remains in a bull market, BCH is lagging behind peer cryptocurrencies in terms of gains.

Bitcoin Cash increased over 25% year-to-date, while its previous rival fork Bitcoin SV is up 60%. Bitcoin and Ethereum have risen nearly 120% and 250% in the same period.

For this reason, it had a substantial impact on the behaviour of all financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies. It turns out that the fluctuations experienced by the virtual currency market during this period reflect changes in other capital and commodity markets. This market has also shown relative stability during this difficult time. It is another proof that cryptocurrencies can be treated as a mature and full-fledged financial instrument.

Social systems are characterized by a vast network of connections and factors that can influence their structure and dynamics. Among these systems, the entire economic sphere of human activity seems to be the most interconnected and complex. All financial markets belong to this sphere, including the youngest of them - cryptocurrencies.

The first cryptocurrency - bitcoin - appeared in 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis. Its creators intended to provide a tool for carrying out transactions via the Internet without the participation of a central unit managing the issue of money. From this perspective, cryptocurrencies can be considered as an independent financial instrument. However, has the cryptocurrency market lived up to the hopes placed in it? How did it react to the situation caused by the emergence of crisis conditions? And have cryptocurrencies already reached the maturity and stability required of a full-fledged financial instrument?

Events related to the outbreak and development of the COVID-19 epidemic provided an excellent opportunity to seek answers to these questions. A group of scientists from the IFJ PAN in Krakow lead by Prof. Stanislaw Drozdz decided to study the behaviour of the cryptocurrency market in response to the economic situation caused by the coronavirus.

""Our previous quantitative analyses of the various characteristics of the complexity of the cryptocurrency market and the specifics of its correlation with more traditional world markets, such as stocks, currencies or commodities, showed that this market in these aspects became essentially indistinguishable and independent from them. With the pandemic ahead, however, we seriously considered the possibility that investors would start to get rid of something like bitcoin in the first place. Due to their virtuality, most potential market participants still perceive cryptocurrencies as quite peculiar items. In times of crisis, during violent economic and political turmoil, people resort to financial resources they consider more reliable. But our comparisons showed that solid instruments recorded drops at the most critical moments, while cryptocurrencies behaved much more stable,"" says Prof. Drozdz.

In the first phase of the pandemic, when it was not known how the whole situation would develop, there was an escape from risky financial instruments to bitcoin. One could observe a positive correlation of bitcoin with financial instruments considered safe, such as the Swiss franc, Japanese yen, gold and silver. Then there was a further increase in the number of infections around the world and the associated sharp drops in global stock markets - especially in the US - due to a total sell-off of all assets, including bitcoin. Investors resorted to cash, mainly the yen and the dollar. During this period, bitcoin lost its safe-haven status, but the same was true of gold and silver. Still, it behaved like a regular, traditional, and reliable financial instrument. Particularly significant is the correlation of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) with conventional financial instruments during the spikes on global stock exchanges as the epidemic slows down during the summer of 2020.

""This is an intriguing effect because there were no such correlations before the pandemic, and they remain at a significant level. It may be proof that bitcoin has become a full-fledged element of the financial market. One can say that the COVID-19 pandemic has positively verified cryptocurrencies. It turned out that investors were not afraid of bitcoin; quite the opposite - they included it in their investment portfolios,"" Dr. Marcin Watorek describes the research findings.

Scientists from Krakow focused on the dynamic and structural properties of the cryptocurrency market. They analyzed data showing the exchange rates of 129 cryptocurrencies on the Binance platform. The analysis consisted of three parts aimed at examining a different aspect of the market structure.

""We approached the topic from three standpoints: the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other virtual and fiat currencies, coupling and decoupling of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, and the inner structure of the cryptocurrency market. We used data from January 2019 to June 2020. This period covers the specific time of the COVID-19 pandemic; we paid special attention to this event and examined how strong its impact was on the structure and dynamics of the market. The analyzed data include several other significant events, such as the double bull and bear phase in 2019,"" Dr. Jaroslaw Kwapien explains the methodology of the work.

The analysis of the cross-correlation between the cryptocurrency market represented by the BTC/USD and ETH/USD exchange rate and the traditional markets of major fiat currencies, major commodities (such as oil and gold) and US stock indices led to the conclusion that the cryptocurrency market was independent of other markets throughout 2019, but temporarily correlated with these markets during several events in the first half of 2020, such as in January, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in the United States, in March during the pandemic outbreak, and from May to July 2020 during the second wave of the pandemic. In the first case, bitcoin showed anti-correlation with major stock indices such as the S&P500 and Nasdaq100, but in the second and third cases, the corresponding correlations were positive. The correlations between bitcoin and several fiat currencies and the commodity market were also positive for these phases.

The lack of statistically significant correlations in 2019, when classic financial instruments experienced no turmoil, was presumably due to market cap asymmetry between the cryptocurrency market and conventional markets to the disadvantage of the former, which is still too small to have any significant impact on other markets. However, traditional markets can easily influence the cryptocurrency market when they become turbulent. This is what happened in March and June 2020.

""The most significant result of our analyses of the dynamics of the world's financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic is that the cryptocurrency market, and especially bitcoin, turned out to be one of the most resistant to turbulence experienced by all global markets during this period. This observation is in line with and complements our previously published results on the approached stability and maturity of the cryptocurrency market in the past 2-3 years. The COVID-19 period seems to confirm those earlier signals"", Prof. Drozdz summarizes the work.

Bitcoin’s price trended up for the third straight day, hitting as high as $16,487, according to data from CoinDesk 20. It dipped somewhat since hitting that level and traded at $16,240 as of press time.

“Bitcoin rose significantly above the $16,100 mark. Buyers pushed the price due to the large volume,” noted Constantin Kogan, managing partner at investment firm Wave Financial.

George McDonaugh, managing director at investment firm KR1, highlighted a key difference between the price run-up in 2020 versus the mooning that occurred back in 2017. “Bitcoin has spent 0.32% of its life at $16,000 and above, which means there were relatively very few buyers at that level back in 2017,” he told CoinDesk. “This correlates to there being very few sellers at this level now, meaning there isn’t a strong resistance band for the bulls to push the price higher.”

“I’m seeing an increasing demand from more traditional family offices making their first investments into bitcoin as a long-term hedge or as insurance for their existing portfolio of investments,” Michael Gord, chief executive officer of Global Digital Assets, told CoinDesk. “I expect this trend to continue as bitcoin keeps maintaining its value and being uncorrelated to most other asset classes.”

Bitcoin isn’t entirely uncorrelated from other asset classes like equities, but lately the correlation between the world’s oldest cryptocurrency and the S&P 500 has dropped a little bit.

KR1’s McDonaugh is expecting bitcoin’s price to reach $20,000, but it might take some time to get there as some profit-taking is likely to ensue. “$20,000 is a far more psychological barrier, so it is likely to be ‘HODLers’ – people holding bitcoin forever – that may de-risk at that level and produce some selling pressure,” he said.

Bitcoin options traders aren’t fully convinced that it will trade at $20,000 in 2020. The probabilities calculated using December expiration have pegged only a 16% chance of $20,000 bitcoin, a 29% for $18,000 and a 39% of $17,000 according to data aggregator Skew.

Nevertheless, analysts project that bitcoin can soon surpass at least $16,500 consistently. “Given market sentiment and current trends, I am still bullish on BTC,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at trading firm Efficient Frontier. “Though we may range between $16,000 and $16,500 for a bit before breaking resistance.”

Announced in October, the new-look wallet will allow users to buy, sell and store a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum , Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

In the near future, the company intends to allow users to make purchases using these same digital currencies too.

The new wallet was originally expected to land for US users in early 2021, before expanding into other territories by the end of the second quarter, but the firm has dropped its waiting list in favor of an an early launch.

To generate momentum, PayPal has also announced it will waive all related transaction fees until the turn of the year.

PayPal cryptocurrency wallet

One of the main criticisms levelled at cryptocurrencies is that genuine use cases are few and far between; currently, crypto is more of an asset than a utility.

However, the ambition behind PayPal’s new digital wallet is to widen that pool of use cases drastically, lending greater legitimacy to the cult technology that has so far failed to transform to the global payments ecosystem as promised.

“This solution will not involve any additional integrations, volatility risk or incremental transactions fees for either consumers or merchants, and will fundamentally bolster the utility of cryptocurrencies,” explained Dan Schulman, PayPal CEO.

“This is just the beginning of the opportunities we see as we work hand in hand with regulators to accept new forms of digital currencies.”

Crucially, the new system will have no effect on PayPal’s 26 million merchants, who will still receive payment in fiat currency, irrespective of whether the customer has paid using crypto.

On top of handling processing and settlement, PayPal will act as a currency converter, switching cryptocurrency to dollars (and other currencies) based on the day’s rate.

The main caveat, however, is that PayPal will charge a relatively significant fee for transactions that involve converting cryptocurrency into fiat and vice versa. The firm will charge a 2.3% fee for transactions involving less than $100, falling to 1.5% for transactions worth $1,000 or more. There will also be a discrepancy between the price at which PayPal buys and sells cryptocurrencies.

Presumably, the measures are designed to offset risk shouldered by the firm relating to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. For example, if a user were to purchase ten dollars worth of goods in bitcoin, but the value of the cryptocurrency fell the following day, PayPal (as the intermediary) would find itself out of pocket by the margin of the fall.

Bitcoin (BTC) eclipses old highs from 2019.

Pfizer (PFE) vaccine announcement lifts global markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls kept their feet on the gas this week, lifting the world’s largest cryptocurrency to a fourth straight week of gains. Four weeks ago, BTC traded near $11,000 and now has launched above $16,000. The gains have not just accumulated in the last few weeks, however. Bitcoin has taken out the 2019 highs of $13,800 and is now up an impressive 127% year to date. BTC now only has the all-time price high of $19,783.06, which it briefly touched in 2017 to contend with.

Bitcoin (BTC) blows past 2019 highs.

Macro news was plentiful this week. Joe Biden declared victory in the contentious U.S. elections while the latest Corona Virus news was mixed. Corona Virus hospitalizations rose globally, prompting select U.S. cities and European nations to apply pandemic restrictions once again. News from biotech behemoth Pfizer (PFE) helped to quell those worries, however. Pfizer announced that its Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in an interim analysis of its phase 3 trial, sending both crypto and equities markets soaring.

The Atlanta-based cryptocurrency payment processing company Bitpay is now getting involved with payroll services. The firm announced the launch of Bitpay Send, a mass payout service that enables organizations of all sizes to pay employees, affiliates, and freelance contractors.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment services provider Bitpay has announced the launch of a new product called Bitpay Send. The new platform is called a mass payout service and it aims to help employers and other types of organizations pay workers in crypto.

In addition to the Bitpay Send launch, the firm also detailed that the company Adgate Media now leverages the mass payout system. Adgate connects with digital advertiser affiliates that reward users for engagement.

“We have lots of affiliates who wanted to be paid in bitcoin, especially those who are based outside North America and Europe where access to bank accounts is difficult,” said Dan Sapozhnikov Adgate‘s President. “One of our biggest challenges is that we did not want to buy and hold crypto and having Bitpay manage that risk was an important factor in choosing Bitpay Send,” he added.

Sapozhnikov further said:

With Bitpay Send, we are able to get our affiliates paid in a matter of minutes and not days.

Bitpay’s service will compete with companies like Bitwage, a firm that also offers infrastructure to pay a company’s employees with digital assets like BTC, and BCH. In order to leverage the new Bitpay Send, users don’t need a bank account to leverage the platform.

However, Bitpay Send users will need access to a crypto asset wallet and have a Bitpay ID. The company announcement says the firm will charge a 1% fee for processing cross-border payments.

“Blockchain payment adoption is growing because it offers an easy way to send and receive payments on a global scale,” said Stephen Pair, CEO of Bitpay. “Traditional international payment methods are cumbersome, costly, and slow. With Bitpay Send, companies can make mass payouts without having to buy, own or manage crypto and their recipients receive payments quicker and at a lower cost,” the executive added.

Bitpay’s system allows for payments in BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, and a few stablecoin assets as well. The Bitpay Send announcement also states that “Customers provide all necessary background details for Know-Your-Customer regulations.”

“Bitpay Send enables companies to make payroll payments, facilitate customer cashout requests, pay independent contractors or affiliates, issue rewards or rebates and financially settle with marketplace sellers,” the firm’s product launch statements conclude. “The company funds payments in fiat and leverages the blockchain to send pre-tax payments without having to own or handle digital currency, eliminating inherent exposure to its volatility or risk.”

According to a Nov. 12 report by local news agency Prime Press, Belarusbank is rolling out a service allowing users to exchange cryptocurrency using a Visa payment card. As reported, the new service enables trading crypto against fiat currencies like the Belarusian ruble as well as the United States dollar and the euro.

Belarusbank executives reportedly said that the launch of the new crypto service comes in line with the company’s digital transformation program that was announced a few years ago.

The new service is reportedly available to citizens of Belarus and Russia. The bank is also planning to extend the list of countries supporting the service as well as the list of supported cryptocurrencies in the near future, the report notes.

According to the report, the new feature is a result of Belarusbank’s partnership with local crypto payment operator Whitebird. Prior to introducing the new service, the two companies reportedly partnered to jointly explore the crypto industry in 2018.

Belarusbank is apparently one of the first banks in Belarus pushing its own crypto service. The bank initially announced its plans to set up a crypto exchange in early 2019.

Key Takeaways Incognito launched a treasure hunt to explore issues around online privacy.

Clues based on privacy themes will lead users to QR codes around the internet.

Treasure chests of crypto will only pay out rewards when enough users have found the code.

Incognito, a privacy project that allows users to shield funds and send Bitcoin anonymously, has taken a novel approach to raising awareness about online privacy — a scavenger hunt.

A Quest for Privacy Awareness

The Incognito app now has a Quest feature listing 16 clues for users to solve. The goal is to find a QR code somewhere on the Internet and scan it in the app to win a reward.

The Quest privacy game shows over a dozen chests on-screen, each revealing a clue when a user taps on it.

According to Incognito, the clues are aimed at guiding players “to further explore the issue of privacy in tech, in both decentralized and traditional finance, and even socially.” Clues point to Ethereum’s incognito mode, Edward Snowden’s Twitter account, and other corners of the internet where privacy is discussed.

Andrey Bugaevski, Incognito’s project lead, told Crypto Briefing:

“Many people in the crypto sphere have no idea that they’re completely exposed. Without being alarmist, we wanted to draw attention to the privacy problem in an engaging, interesting way – and take users on a journey through the best privacy solutions already out there for them.”

Treasure chests may require dozens of users to find a code before opening, and at that point, players receive tokens that allow them to spin a wheel for prizes.

The prize wheel opens on Nov. 19.

Prizes range from VPN subscriptions and hardware wallets all the way to one whole Bitcoin. Additionally, participants are eligible to win the opportunity to run an Incognito node and continue earning rewards for validating the network.

Bitcoin Bull Michael Novogratz’s company, Galaxy Digital, has acquired two cryptocurrency firms in preparation to meet a “bigger wave of institutional demand” for bitcoin.

Big Wave of Institutional Demand for Bitcoin Incoming

Galaxy Digital Holdings announced Friday that it has acquired two cryptocurrency trading firms: Drawbridge Lending and Blue Fire Capital.

New York City-headquartered crypto financial services and investment management company Galaxy Digital provides trading, asset management, and investment banking services.

“Institutional investors and corporates are becoming more knowledgeable and comfortable with digital assets and they are increasingly grasping the purpose and importance of cryptocurrency in their investment strategies,” commented Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital.

During his company’s Q3 2020 earnings call on Friday, Novogratz said that the Covid-19 pandemic was “really an accelerant for the cryptocurrency business for bitcoin, for blockchain, for everything that we do … I see an unbelievable opportunity for our company and for the space.” Bitcoin is trading at $16,250 at the time of writing. Novogratz explained that the cryptocurrency is trading at this price “not because there’s a speculative mania going on,” elaborating:

It’s trading like that because institutions, hedge funds, high net worth individuals, family offices are all moving into bitcoin. They’re moving in as a store of wealth, they’re moving in as an inflation hedge, they’re moving in because it’s become an institutional asset.

Recently, renowned billionaire investor Bill Miller said that he thinks “every major bank, every major investment bank, every major high net worth firm is going to eventually have some exposure to bitcoin or what’s like it.” JPMorgan’s analysts also said, “some investors that previously invested in gold ETFs, such as family offices, may be looking at bitcoin as an alternative to gold.”

Chicago-based Drawbridge Lending is a CFTC-regulated company that provides commercial and individual loans on secured bitcoin held at a qualified custodian. Blue Fire Capital, also based in Chicago, provides investment brokerage and trading services with a focus on crypto assets.

Novogratz continued:

We are looking forward to seamlessly integrating Drawbridge and Blue Fire into Galaxy Digital Trading … to help further meet what we believe will be an even bigger wave of institutional demand.

The largest bank in Belarus, Belarusbank, has reportedly begun providing a cryptocurrency exchange service, allowing customers to buy bitcoin using Visa cards.

Belarusbank’s new cryptocurrency exchange service is in collaboration with bitcoin exchange service provider Whitebird, several local news outlets reported Thursday. The bank revealed its plans to create a cryptocurrency exchange platform early last year.

Founded in 1991, Belarusbank merged with Sberbank of Belarus in 1995. The government of Belarus owns 99.95% of the bank’s capital. In 2018, the bank entered into a strategic partnership with Whitebird, a resident of Belarus’ Hi-Tech Park, which is also known as the Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe. Whitebird operates under Belarus’ legal framework and in accordance with Decree No. 8 of the President of the Republic of Belarus “On the development of the digital economy” and related decisions of the supervisory board of the Hi-Tech Park.

“This is a service that allows you to quickly buy or sell bitcoin (BTC) for USD [U.S. dollars], RUB [Russian rubles], BYN [Belarusian rubles] at the optimal rate at the time of the transaction,” Whitebird’s website details, adding that “The service works online” and “the purchase and sale procedure takes place using Visa payment cards.” Belarusbank plans to add buying bitcoin with euros in the future.

Initially, the bank’s new cryptocurrency service is available to citizens of Belarus and Russia, local media conveyed, citing the press service of the bank. In the future, Belarusbank plans to extend the crypto service to customers in other countries. The bank also plans to collaborate further with Whitebird to support more cryptocurrencies and provide additional related services.

Key Takeaways An independent report from Citi Bank’s Managing Director argues that Bitcoin is the digital gold of the 21st century.

The devaluation of the worlds’ reserve currency—the U.S. dollar—formed the basis of the commentary.

Share this article

CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”

History of Money and Gold

The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.

The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.

And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.

However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.

With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.

The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:

“Bitcoin move happened in the aftermath of the Great Financial crisis (of 2008) which saw a new change in the monetary regime as we went to ZERO percent interest rates.”

Fitzpatrick pointed out that the first bull cycle in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2013 when it increased by 555 times resulted from this.

Currently, the COVID-19 crisis and the government’s associated monetary and fiscal response are creating a similar market environment as gold in the 1970s. Governments have made it clear that they will not shy away from unprecedented money printing until the GDP and employment numbers are back up.

The above analysis is music to the ears of any Bitcoin enthusiast. What has been oft-preached across crypto forums is finally going mainstream.

Hyberbullish Bitcoin Targets

Fitzpatrick did not stop there; his price prediction chart sees Bitcoin price at $318,000 by December 2021.

The four-year bull and bear cycles post 2011 and the ascending parallel channel since 2013 projects growth of 102 times from the low of $3,200 in 2018 by December 2021. It reads:

“You look at price action being much more symmetrical or so over the past seven years forming what looks like a very well defined channel giving us an up move of similar timeframe to the last rally (in 2017).”

Fitzpatrick also pegs gold at $4,000-$8,000 based on an imminent economic crisis in another report.

Therefore, in all likelihood, the targets for BTC might seem exaggerated to traditional investors. Nevertheless, the principle theory of a paradigm shift in the global currency market is not new. Economist Ray Dalio has hinted at the debasement of the dollar and a paradigm shift as well.

Bitcoin might be the missing link in the new paradigm.

Moreover, the exposure of such a target to America’s largest bank’s institutional clients is alone bullish for the market sentiments.

China has become a giant in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem with major mines and pools, quick, cheap labor and a majority control of the world’s hashing power. So, should you go set up a mining operation there? Do the pros outweigh the cons? Is China actually a threat to the Bitcoin ecosystem? Let’s look at the state of Chinese mining.

Back to the basics

In the beginning of Bitcoin, you could simply mine from your laptop or set up a few miners in your home to run the hashing algorithm. But as more miners started turning on and the Bitcoin mining difficulty rose, higher levels of computing power and electricity was needed to solve the equations and reap the reward.

Only a finite amount of Bitcoin can be mined — 21 million tokens — so as time goes on, it will get harder and harder to mine them. Miners continue to need better and faster hardware, which requires more electricity. Today, mining operations are moving to large data centers where thousands of miners run day and night.

Related: How to mine Bitcoin: Everything you need to know

Why mention all of this? Because when mining at a large scale, electricity costs, labor costs, the speed of acquiring new hardware and sustainability come into play if generating profit is the goal — and China has the advantage in nearly all of these areas.

The state of mining in China

At the end of 2019, China produced nearly two-thirds of the world’s hashing power. Even though cryptocurrency usage and exchanges are reportedly banned in China and Bitcoin mining was once in danger of being shut down, the government took an about-face and is increasingly embracing the use of blockchain technology in its major industries — and allowing Bitcoin mining to grow.

Related: US Bitcoin holders worry about Chinese control of the mining network

Bitcoin mining in China is a growing industry because labor costs are cheap, turn-around time is incredibly quick, and lead time and production costs are much lower, since the country is a hub for global trade. Since much of the hardware used to mine Bitcoin is made in China, miners can very quickly be upgraded. If you want to set up a data center fast with low overhead and expenses, do it in China.

Low electricity costs in the form of hydropower are available as well. Because Bitcoin mining requires so much electricity between powering the miners and powering the fans to cool the miners, a data center needs to get electricity as cheaply as possible. Hydropower in the Sichuan province is reportedly as low as $0.02 per kWh during the rainy season, and the Chinese government is now encouraging mining in this province so operations can take advantage of the hydropower plants there.

Related: Sichuan rainy season to give Bitcoin hash rate a much needed jolt

But only some Chinese mining operations run on cleaner, cheaper hydropower. Most run instead on coal, which is a dirtier and more expensive option. Of the main power sources today, hydro is the cheapest, at around $0.01 to $0.02 per kWh, with wind being another cheap option at $0.025 cents per kwh. Gas and coal are the more expensive options, at $0.03 to $0.035 cents (plus transmission costs and taxes). So, while labor and materials may be cheap, coal usage makes mining operations unsustainable from both a cost perspective and environmental perspective. Factor in the political instability of setting up mining operations in China, and you may want to look elsewhere.

Can China stay on top?

Anyone wanting to set up scaled mining operations are increasingly seeking out locations in Nordic countries, Canada and the United States. While these locations may offer higher start-up expenses and maintenance costs, the availability of sustainable, cost-effective electricity is proving to be a big advantage. Additionally, these areas are more politically stable, so there is less threat that the government will one day decide to shut down all mining operations. In fact, Canada deemed mining operations as “essential services” during its COVID-19 pandemic shutdown.

Related: Regulatory overview of crypto mining in different countries

This may be the reason why the world’s hashing power is shifting locations. According to a recent report, Chinese hashing power is decreasing compared with last year yet growing in other parts of the world.

Another reason for this decrease may be that Chinese mining was hit hard in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, causing new hardware to be significantly delayed in getting to data centers. In an industry where every minute counts, using slower, older miners for even a day longer means losing money and advantage. Additionally, China’s quarantine rules prevented workers from tending to their rigs, further disrupting operations.

Additionally, the third Bitcoin halving occurred this past May, cutting the mining reward in half and forcing miners to make significant upgrades to their hardware to stay competitive. Because it now takes twice as much hashing power to mine the same amount of Bitcoin as a year ago, mining operations have needed to not only upgrade, but make sure their energy costs were staying efficient. Following the halving, many miners around the world switched off because the endeavor was no longer profitable.

On top of it all, this summer’s monsoon season caused excessive flooding in the Sichuan province, leading to electrical shortages that cut up to 20% of the region’s hash rate.

Despite these significant setbacks, mining in China is sure to bounce back. But with other parts of the world embracing and encouraging Bitcoin mining, and with the greater sustainability offered elsewhere, we may soon see China’s place as the giant of the industry challenged.

The akoin cryptocurrency, created by famous singer and philanthropist Akon, has started trading on a global crypto exchange. It is also being launched as a means of payment in a tech city in Kenya as a pilot for Akon City, the $6 billion futuristic city that is being built in Senegal.

Akoin Crypto Starts Trading and Is Being Used for Payments in Kenya

The much-anticipated cryptocurrency created by Senegalese-American star and philanthropist Akon that will be used as the primary currency in his $6 billion Akon City in Senegal has launched. The akoin cryptocurrency (AKN) began trading against BTC and USDT on the Bittrex Global crypto exchange on Nov. 11.

The akoin cryptocurrency has also launched in Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC) as a pilot for Akon City. The MMTC is a $2 billion metropolis centered around a 5,000-bed medical and technology complex located in Kenya’s Kakamega county, its website describes.

Julius Mwale, the principal investor of Mwale Medical and Technology City, said in a podcast interview on Blockdown 3.0 that the complex is expected to be fully completed by the end of this year, adding:

We’re going to use exclusively akoin by the end of 2021.

He explained that there are currently 35,000 residents and over 2,000 merchants, and the akoin cryptocurrency system will be implemented for them all. He is confident that by the end of next year, there will be more than 20,000 workers whom will be paid in the akoin cryptocurrency.

1.5 Million Monthly Transactions Expected

“We are expecting to do an initial 30,000 transactions starting next month,” Mwale continued. Residents will be able to swap between the akoin crypto and large mobile minutes, m-pasa, and the U.S. dollar, he detailed. After the initial 30,000 transactions in 30 days, a credit card will also be launched so that merchants that accept Visa or Mastercard will be able to accept akoin. The system will then be scaled up to facilitate 1.5 million transactions a month. He elaborated:

That’s 5,000 workers for 1.5 million transactions a month after the initial 30,000 [transactions].

Mwale claimed that “People are very very excited” about the project because the city currently uses m-pesa which charges transaction fees. He explained that most people in the area do not make a lot of money, so the transaction fees are “very expensive for them.”

In contrast, there will not be any charges or transaction fees within the akoin ecosystem, Mwale emphasized. “The only charges will come if you are getting out of the network so people are very excited, they’re going to save a lot of money.”

Pilot for $6 Billion Akon City in Senegal

Akon, whose real name is Alioune Badara Thiam, is building a futuristic $6 billion Akon City in Senegal, which he calls a “real-life Wakanda,” referring to Marvel’s hit movie Black Panther. In September, the Grammy-nominated artist unveiled details of what will be in Akon City, particularly in seven major districts.

Mwale explained that “akoin is going to be the exclusive cryptocurrency for Akon city,” adding:

This is the test ground for akoin before it moves into the Akon city as we start building there next year to literally turn Africa into a cryptocurrency ecosystem within the next decade.

Mwale explained that the Kenyan government “literally outlawed cash transactions and any other transactions other than digital so everything since the Covid-19 pandemic began has been digital transaction.” He believes that the akoin crypto launch has “the best timing … because everybody now has to basically operate in digital transactions.” He concluded: “it’s been very easy for us to transition to akoin from other digital transactions, the m-pesa and other transactions that we already have.”

Key Takeaways The DeFi surge in 2020 led to more than a dozen hacks over several months.

Nearly $100 million was lost due to bugs, exploits, and hacks.

Although some losses were recovered, DeFi users need to stay vigilant when interacting with applications.

Share this article

DeFi is nothing short of a revolution. Automated blockchain-based financial primitives open a world of possibilities to disrupt traditional finance and make it more accessible.

This immense potential attracted a massive wave of users and investors to the space. In a matter of months, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols reached more than over $13 billion.

Meanwhile, activity on the DeFi epicenter blockchain, Ethereum, skyrocketed. The benefits appear to be endless, too.

Bringing financial activity on-chain allows for automation, trustless setups, and transparency.

However, it also creates numerous attack vectors, impossible in traditional finance.

DeFi Hacks

The majority of DeFi projects are open-source, meaning that code is easily accessible via GitHub for inspection both by well-intentioned and malicious users. If wrongdoers find bugs first, they can steal other users’ funds.

Besides bugs in code, DeFi applications are vulnerable to external exploits as well. DeFi’s efficiency mostly depends on composability, meaning that the more projects that are interconnected, the more value they can provide. Hence, exploiters can game the system and cause protocols to behave in ways not intended by developers.

The irreversibility of blockchain transactions exacerbates the situation. If hacks occur, funds are likely lost for good, though some projects will reimburse users from their pockets.

The following is a collection of over a dozen hacks and exploits within DeFi in 2020.

The Top 19 DeFi Hacks of 2020

1. bZx – $954,000

Although DeFi experienced explosive growth after introducing the Compound liquidity mining program, the space has been brewing since 2014. Many platforms existed and suffered from hacks before the DeFi summer of 2020.

bZx, a DeFi project focused on margin trading and lending, had a troubled start of 2020 with two consecutive hacks resulting in almost a million-dollar loss. The attacks occurred on Feb. 14 and Feb. 18.

Hackers didn’t find any bugs in bZx smart contracts. Instead, they exploited the interconnectedness of DeFi protocols. The exploit involved taking out flash-loans (borrowed and repaid in a single transaction) and manipulating asset prices to drain funds from lending pools by taking larger loans than was possible under normal circumstances.

The platform covered losses from its insurance fund, which receives 10% of all interest lenders earn.

2. dForce and Lendf.me – $25 million

On Apr. 19, a hacker took $25 million from a decentralized lending platform Lendf.me, which was functioning under the umbrella of the Chinese DeFi platform dForce. The hack used a well-known vulnerability of Ethereum, which was used in the infamous DAO Hack in 2016.

Ethereum’s ERC-777 token standard has a vulnerability, enabling an attacker to drain funds from some smart contracts holding them. An imBTC token that represented BTC on Ethereum was the ERC-777 standard, which allowed an attack vector.

Notably, the hacker returned stolen funds to Lendf.Me admin, which didn’t save dForce from criticism.

The same attack involving imToken occurred on Uniswap around the same time as on dForce, but hackers managed to drain much less – $300,000.

3. Hegic – $48,000

The options platform Hegic wasn’t attacked by anyone, yet a typo in the project’s code led to freezing users’ assets.

Traders and holders can use options on Hegic to insure against price volatility. Consider ETH is worth $500, and a user buys an option contract, which enables them to sell one ETH for 500 DAI within some time window. If ETH price tanks to $400, the user can safely exercise the contract, liquidating their position for 500 DAI.

On Apr. 25, Hegic published a warning about a typo in the smart contract, which led to freezing funds in unexercised contracts. If a user didn’t use their option, somebody had to unlock assets, but they couldn’t due to a typo.

Hegic’s founder reimbursed everyone who suffered.

4. Maker – $8 million

Maker found itself in a predicament after the crypto market crashed on Mar. 12. The platform ended up in over $8 million in debt as some of its loans were liquidated for free.

Since Maker is decentralized, it can’t use credit scores to verify the creditworthiness of its borrowers. Hence, loans on the platform are overcollateralized, meaning that a borrower supplies more assets that they can take out.

If the collateral value goes below a certain threshold, the loan is marked as undercollateralized, and liquidators can participate in an auction to liquidate the loan for a 13% reward.

When the market crashed, the activity on Ethereum soared as users panicked.

The network’s low throughput led to congestion, and many liquidators on Maker stopped working. Consequently, a handful of liquidators won auctions for free because there was no competition.

Blocknative, a forensic company, later published a report, saying that not only did users’ panic contributed to the congestion, but also malicious bot activity.

Bots spammed Ethereum with junk transactions that recursively replaced their existing transactions to slow other liquidators down and take advantage of the reduced competition.

5. Argent – $0

White-hat hackers found a severe vulnerability in the DeFi-focused mobile wallet Argent in OpenZeppelin on Jun. 18.

Argent replicates the experience of using a crypto wallet as a CC card with the concept of Guardians. Guardians are trusted devices with limited permissions to a user’s wallet, helping recover access to a wallet if the original owner loses access.

The uncovered vulnerability would have enabled hackers to freeze funds in wallets without Guardians. By the time the vulnerability was discovered, over 300 wallets with more than 160 ETH were at risk.

Fortunately, none of them suffered losses as the team implemented fixes in time.

6. Bancor – $0

Bancor, an app focused on asset swaps and conducted one of the largest ICOs of 2017, self-hacked to fix a critical vulnerability.

As a result of one of the system’s updates, users who interacted with the upgraded smart contract could lose their funds. $545,000 were at risk, but the Bancor team initiated a hack themselves to protect assets.

Besides the team, however, other white-hat hackers managed to drain over $130,000. Bancor got lucky, as it could have been malicious actors.

Bancor suffered from a large-scale hack back in 2018, and warnings about the new exploit had been floating around since Mar. 2020.

7. Balancer – $500,000

A decentralized exchange with customizable liquidity pools, Balancer saw an attack similar to what bZx suffered from. The incident occurred on Jun. 28.

The hack exploited a deflationary function of Statera (STA) token, which burns 1% of each transaction. The attacker used a flash loan to borrow a large amount of ETH and traded ETH against STA to decrease the number of STA tokens in the pool.

Once the amount of STA became very small, its price denominated in other assets in the pool surged so that the attacker could swap STA for other assets cheaply.

The team warned the community about the dangers of deflationary tokens before the hack occurred. However, as the protocol is permissionless, it couldn’t prevent users from adding unsafe assets.

8. Uniswap – $530,000

The initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) of bZx protocol’s token BZRX on Uniswap highlighted the IDO model’s imperfections.

During an IDO, users send money directly to the team, and an asset’s price grows as a function of buying activity.

Less than a minute since the BZRX IDO started on Jul. 13, the price jumped 12x due to the front-running bot activity. Bots were placing buy orders in the same block that marked the start of the IDO.

Besides front-running buyers, the bots spammed the network so that users couldn’t push their transactions through.

How someone made a million dollar in 30 min?

1. Wait for BZRX news for uniswap listing.

2. Write a smart contract that buys token on Uniswap

3. Spam eth network to others can't get in with failed txs — Roman Storm (@rstormsf) July 13, 2020

Once other buyers finally got in for the sale, the price was already high, and the bots’ owners took substantial profits. One early buyer made $500,000.

While the incident wasn’t a hack, it raised concerns about the viability and fairness of IDO models.

9. Opyn – $370,000

A smart contract bug allowed a double-spending attack, causing options protocol Opyn to lose $370,000 on Aug. 4.

The vulnerability was connected to the protocol’s native tokens called oTokens, which users burn when exercising options contracts. The contract couldn’t correctly exercise a batch of options, not burning oTokens at each closure.

Consequently, an attacker could reuse their oTokens balance and drain funds by exercising options for free.

According to PeckShield, a blockchain security company, a person with smart contract programming experience could easily spot the bug.

While the Opyn team couldn’t take down or change the smart contract, it managed to put the protocol on hold and save some of the users’ funds. On top of that, it announced reimbursements along with smart contract audits.

10. YAM – $750,000

A community-led DeFi stablecoin YAM managed to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of hours after it launched on Aug. 11, only to die days later due to a critical rebase bug.

YAM is a modified clone of Ampleforth, a stablecoin with dynamic supply. Depending on the demand, YAM and Ampleforth can increase or decrease the total supply to maintain the $1 peg. Supply is changed by calling a dedicated “rebase” function.

The team wanted to use YAM in the project’s governance, but the rebase function issued excess YAM tokens to the project’s treasury, which diluted YAM holders’ governance power.

Eventually, governance on YAM would be unusable.

The team tried to fix the bug by initiating a voting process to stop rebasing until the project’s governance contract is swapped. However, the initiative failed despite high voter turnout.

YAM’s key difference from Ampleforth is that it automatically bought yCRV tokens whenever supply increased. By the time the team realized nothing could be done to save the project, $750,000 of yCRV were already locked in the treasury.

The team didn’t give up and eventually swapped the project’s governance module to a working one. YAM holders could migrate via a temporary smart contract.

11. Soft Yearn – $250,000

Another rebase bug was exploited by a holder of Soft Yearn (SYFI) token on Sept. 3. The bug enabled a user to turn a $200 investment into $250,000.

Like YAM and Ampleforth, Soft Yearn dynamically changes its supply. However, the supply change didn’t translate to a Uniswap pool, where the token was traded.

A user with 2 SYFI in their wallet spotted the bug before others. After the rebase, they had more than 15,000 tokens worth more than 700 ETH at the time. The user took advantage of the opportunity that appeared in front of them and wiped all the SYFI pool liquidity by dumping all their tokens for ETH.

After the incident, the team published a rescue plan, which included relaunching SYFI tokens and adding 250 ETH to the Uniswap pool.

12. bZx (again) – $8 million

2020 didn’t go well for bZx, as it suffered three attacks. While the first two exploits involved manipulating external protocols, the third hack took advantage of an internal protocol flaw.

When users lend assets on bZx, they receive iTokens, which grow in value as a corresponding lending pool grows. The platform’s vulnerability enabled a hacker to mint iTokens without lending assets.

Consequently, the wrongdoer could exchange unbacked iTokens for the assets in bZx pools on Sept. 13.

The hacker managed to drain more than $8 million in various assets from bZx. However, the team tracked them down and retrieved stolen funds. Following the incident, the team joined forces with PeckShield to enhance bZx security.

14. Lien – $0

Lien Finance, a protocol focused on options and stablecoins, was on the verge of being hacked and losing $10 million in ETH. However, a group of white hat hackers discovered the vulnerability first.

As the report on Lien stated, the platform had a faulty function, which enabled minting large amounts of valueless tokens, which could then be exchanged for ETH stored on its smart contract.

How do you rescue 10 million dollars from a vulnerable smart contract without letting attackers know it’s there? Last Tuesday, @epheph, @sparkpool_eth, @tzhen, @wadealexc, and I found out.https://t.co/WOjO651VIw — samczsun (@samczsun) September 24, 2020

After the white hackers discovered the vulnerability, they couldn’t perform a hack to save the platform’s money because front-running bots would have noticed their transactions.

The hackers communicated with Sparkpool, Ethereum’s largest mining pool. The Sparkpool team then made it possible to execute necessary transactions without revealing them to the bots, which saved 25,000 ETH from being stolen.

15. Eminence – $15 million

Andre Cronje became a superstar of the DeFi scene after launching the yEarn yield optimizer. The corresponding token, YFI, surged from 0 to tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of weeks. Consequently, many profit-seeking users started to closely monitor Andre’s activity to jump into his new projects before others.

One such project was a gaming platform named Eminence. After Andre mentioned its unaudited beta smart contract in a tweet, users threw $15 million into it. Since the contract was in the beta stage, it had a vulnerability, and hackers drained users’ funds by minting EMN tokens and selling them for more valuable assets on Sept. 28.

The hackers subsequently returned $8 million in DAI to a smart contract controlled by Andre. The returned funds were used to cover some of the users’ losses.

16. UniCats – $140,000

A UniCats app with a yield farming feature had a backdoor, which enabled its developer to control users’ funds even when they withdrew money from the platform.

It’s common for DeFi users to connect their wallets to various DeFi apps, granting them access on different levels. UniCats asked users to permit spending an unlimited number of tokens. An anonymous user Jhon Doe granted UniCats the requested permission and lost $140,000 on Oct. 4.

According to a ZenGo crypto wallet report, Jhon wasn’t the only one who suffered from the exploit. Other users brought the malicious developer of UniCats at least $50,000 more.

If you are not yet convinced that you should NOT be approving infinite tokens to some random smart contract/Dapp, here’s a story of how Jhon Doe lost $140K worth of UNI in their sleep.

The hacker took care of their security and used several measures, including swapping addresses and using the crypto mixer Tornado Cash to cover their tracks.

17. Harvest – $24 million

A yield aggregator Harvest received critiques about its centralization before it got exploited for $24 million. Some of the users were concerned about the safety of $1 billion of assets locked on the platform, but the developers failed to change anything.

Shortly after the debates on the protocol’s centralization, $24 million were drained from Harvest due to an exploit on Oct. 26. In theory, a hacker could steal more.

The attacker used flash loans to manipulate stablecoin prices on the decentralized exchange Curve and used arbitrage to buy more stablecoins than they would normally be able to.

Like in the case of Eminence, $2.5 of the stolen funds were sent back to developers. The hacker swapped the rest for renBTC and sent BTC to other addresses. The RenBTC team helped Harvest identify the target addresses, which were then communicated to major exchanges for monitoring.

The team offered a $100,000 bounty to find the wrongdoer, but no one was turned in.

18. PercentFinance – $1 million

PercentFinance, a lending platform forked from the industry-leading Compound, froze $1 million of assets on Nov. 4. According to the team’s post, half of the funds belong to the project’s mods.

Users funds on our platform amounting to ~$1m are stuck in money market smart contracts Reaching out to @WrappedBTC and @circlepay/@coinbase respective teams to help us make affected USDC/WBTC holders whole Read Below:https://t.co/63Q1DlyqVv — Percent Finance (@PercentFinance) November 4, 2020

The project’s vulnerability was inherited from Compound’s old smart contract, which developers forked. One of the developers decided to upgrade the smart contracts, but after doing so, they realized that transactions to the new contracts couldn’t be signed.

Hence, the old contracts were broken.

The team now hopes that issuers of the locked funds, which include centralized USDC and WBTC, can blacklist the addresses with blocked assets and issue new tokens for users who suffered from the bug.

The team also offered to launch new lending contracts, enabling 73% of USDC lenders’ funds after borrowing their loans. The lost WBTC are frozen forever if WBTC-issuer, BitGo, doesn’t help the PercentFinance team. ETH is lost without a chance for recovery.

18. SharkTron – $260 million

SharkTron, a DeFi platform featuring liquidity mining on Tron, had an incident according to a statement Tron Foundation issued on Nov. 9.

(1/2) Regarding the shark incident we have contacted @Binance and worked together on chasing down the funds and people behind this. A portion of the funds have been frozen on Binance. — TRON Foundation (@Tronfoundation) November 9, 2020

Some sources report a loss of $260 million of users’ assets from several platforms associated with SharkTron, including Shark Invest and Shark Dice. Some users attach screenshots of wallets, which suffered losses.

Tron Foundation claimed that it joined forces with Binance and frozen some stolen funds on the exchange. On top of that, it promised to track down and freeze the remainder of the funds.

It advised users to file reports to the police in the meantime.

19. Akropolis – $2 million

Until it was hacked on Nov. 12, Akropolis provided its users with convenient deposit-and-forget pools, which automatically invested users’ funds and generated yields. When a user deposited their funds in a pool, they got ownership tokens in return.

A hacker noticed that Akropolis smart contracts didn’t have a whitelist for ERC-20 tokens, which can be deposited to the savings pools. To take advantage of this vulnerability, a hacker created a fake ERC-20 token and took out a flash loan of 800,000 DAI on the dYdX lending and trading platform.

By depositing fake tokens and the real DAI, the hacker managed to get twice as many ownership tokens as they normally would. Hence, they withdrew funds they didn’t have access to.

Akropolis didn’t admit the hack immediately. Moreover, the platform’s smart contracts were separately audited by two blockchain security firms.

At the time of writing, Akropolis’ stablecoin pools are frozen. The team is seeking ways to reimburse damages.

2020 Hacks: Closing Thoughts

Decentralized setups are liberating, yet they impose tremendous responsibility on users. While some teams strive to save users’ funds or recover losses, there are no safety guarantees.

Anyone interacting with DeFi protocols and crypto, in general, should be vigilant and mindful of their activity. It’s a wild west, no code is flawless, and everyone’s wallet is potentially a honeypot, so precautions should be taken.

During its short but bright history, DeFi has seen multiple hacks, vulnerabilities, and exploits of small and large platforms, which sometimes led to irreversible damage.

As the space progresses, it will see more incidents despite advances in tech and security. Hence, DeFi users should develop appropriate behavioral patterns to stay safe.

Adding his sonorous voice to the chorus of renowned investors talking about bitcoin recently, hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller stated on a CNBC interview this week that he believed bitcoin could perform better than gold.

“I own many, many more times gold than I own bitcoin, but frankly if the gold bet works, the bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner and more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.“

This is worth diving into a bit because the statement is good news for the industry, but it is not the bullish affirmation that it initially seems.

This is not Druckenmiller saying that bitcoin has a better value proposition than gold, or that it has a harder cap or that decentralization is the way to go.

No, this is Druckenmiller saying that bitcoin has more upside because of its market inefficiencies. Let that sink in: The very characteristics that many investors have cited as barriers to investment are what a renowned investor believes will award bitcoin a better performance.

These three factors are all interrelated, dependent perhaps, but they’re not the same.

Let’s look at them one by one:

1. It’s thinner

An asset is considered “thin” if a large order will materially change the price. This can be measured by market depth, or the overall level and breadth of open orders, which can be calculated by adding up buy/sell orders in the system at price levels up to a certain distance from the mid price. The higher the total, the less impact a large order will have.

For instance, the snapshot below shows the placed buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders for BTC/USD at Coinbase. The exchange’s 10% bid or ask order depth is the sum of all buy or sell orders at levels up to 10% from the current mid price.

Source: CryptoCompare

Comparing bitcoin’s order book depth to that of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH, we see that BTC has significant depth by crypto market standards ($20.5 million vs. ETH’s $6 million).

Source: CryptoCompare

The above BTC chart shows that a sell order for 10 BTC (~$159,000), hitting the bids already in the system, would move the price down approximately 0.1%. If you tried to sell 1,000 BTC (~$16 million) at the time of the snapshot, the price could drop as much as 7%, given the state of the order book at Coinbase at the time. (It’s worth noting that this is only on one exchange, market depth varies across exchanges, and that the order book would rapidly change should an order of that size hit the market.)

For comparison, a $16 million order in ETH would move the market down by approximately 35%. The gold market, on the other hand, would barely notice an order of that size.

The chart below shows the relative state of the aggregate market depth across six of the more liquid exchanges, calculated by adding bids and asks at levels up to 10% from the mid price. The increase in sell orders (red line) coincides with the recent price run-up, and shows the reaction from market makers to the increased buying pressure in the market.

2. It’s more illiquid

Liquidity is tied to market depth, but it also invokes spreads between buy and sell prices.

An asset is said to be “illiquid” if the difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is wide. This indicates a reluctance from market makers to take a position in the asset without due compensation, as they make money on the spread. In a thin market, market makers are likely to have a harder time moving positions off their books, so spreads tend to be wider than in markets with more robust order depth.

The chart below shows that the BTC market has low spreads, often lower than those on some gold exchanges. The spreads on Coinbase at time of writing are less than one basis point. According to BullionVault, the gold spread is currently around 17 basis points.

Source: Kaiko

This doesn’t mean Druckenmiller is wrong, though – BTC spreads may be thinner than those often found in gold markets, but in the bitcoin market spreads can be distorted by the structure of trading fees at some exchanges. For now, market depth is a more meaningful indicator of overall market liquidity.

This brings us to Druckenmiller’s third observation, and here things get interesting.

3. It has a lot more beta

Beta is a measure of an asset’s volatility relative to a market benchmark. The beta of Apple, for instance, would be its volatility relative to that of the S&P 500, or 1.7 at time of writing, according to FactSet. The beta of General Electric, to compare a more diversified industrial company, is at 0.7 at time of writing – less volatile than both Apple and the market as a whole.

Calculating the betas of “hedge” assets such as gold and bitcoin is more complicated, because what index do you benchmark against? Taking the S&P 500 as the benchmark (not always appropriate), we get a BTC beta of 0.97, while gold’s beta is only 0.34. So, bitcoin does have a higher beta than gold relative to the stock index, but the utility of this calculation using an unrelated benchmark is doubtful.

What Druckenmiller was probably referring to was not so much beta as volatility. BTC’s annualized 30-day volatility at time of writing is 47% vs. 14% for gold.

When you have a relatively thin and illiquid market, you almost always have higher volatility.

Druckenmiller was not saying that a higher volatility was necessarily good. He knows, however, that a high volatility is an advantage when the momentum is favorable. When there’s upside to be had, a higher beta will give you more. “If the gold bet works,” he says, “the bitcoin bet will probably work better,” because of the volatility. What is a barrier for many can be harnessed as an advantage in the appropriate context.

So, why bitcoin?

It sounds like Druckenmiller doesn’t see bitcoin as a portfolio hedge, unlike many other investors. It sounds like he sees it more as a directional play.

Such an experienced investor no doubt has a well-calibrated portfolio with diversified risk. He has made a compelling case for increased inflation, and implies he has a substantial gold position, presumably as a hedge against currency debasement.

Bitcoin, however, seems to be a side bet. He has a “tiny amount” which he expects to outperform gold if gold does well, because of its market inefficiencies. It’s almost as if his investment in bitcoin is similar to a position in an emerging market – higher risk, but potentially higher return.

But his conviction in bitcoin’s upside feels muted. He even chides Kelly Evans, the CNBC interviewer:“You overstated in your introduction my enthusiasm for bitcoin.”

Rather than say he sees bitcoin as a good store of value, he says that he realizes it could be seen as a good store of value by certain demographics (millennials and Silicon Valley types), implying recognition that they have enough market clout to influence prices. This suggests that he is playing the narrative, rather than believing in the thesis.

But here’s the good news for crypto markets: One of fund management’s best-known names, a self-professed “dinosaur,” recognizes that bitcoin is an “asset class” with a potentially strong investment case for some investor groups. This is a worthy validation. It will encourage other investors to at least do their homework. And it removes career risk for any analyst, adviser or fund manager wishing to present a bitcoin investment case to their colleagues and clients.

Crypto enthusiasts are quick to latch onto any piece of good news as proof that the world is finally seeing the potential. This confirmation bias endemic to our industry led to headlines proclaiming that Druckenmiller said that bitcoin was “better than” gold (he didn’t), that he had “flipped to” bitcoin (far from the truth), that he had become a bitcoin bull (he hasn’t), that he thought that bitcoin was “the best asset” (I doubt that very much).

And while the attention from media is positive, we do ourselves a disservice when we lose perspective. This was not a full-throated endorsement of bitcoin’s superior investment qualities. It was, however, a validation of cryptocurrency as an asset class worth learning more about, as well as a reminder that higher risk can bring higher returns in the right circumstances.

It wasn’t so much an embrace as it was a sideways glance with a nod of recognition. For status and confidence, however, that can be more than enough.

Ethereum forks but not really

So, a strange thing happened to Ethereum this week.

Early Wednesday morning, Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura announced it was experiencing a service outage for its Ethereum mainnet API. This affected services on Ethereum-based services such as Metamask, Uniswap and others. Some exchanges such as Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of volume, suspended ETH withdrawals and transactions as a cautionary measure.

This was disconcerting, as one or two outages is worrying but not alarming – when several high-profile applications get affected, ripples of alarm understandably wash over the community.

It turns out that a bug was detected in an upgrade that shipped a year ago for one of the main Ethereum node software clients, Geth. A fix was implemented and silently shipped in July of this year. Not everyone upgraded to the fix, and some Ethereum applications, including Infura, Blockchair and some miners, got stuck on a minority chain.

This episode reminds us that all technology is vulnerable to code bugs. In the end, the error was human – some platforms didn’t upgrade. (And who among us rigorously updates their laptop software every time there’s an upgrade?) It was also a communication error – the bug was detected, a fix was shipped, but this was not widely broadcast.

It also highlights that, although Ethereum is in theory a decentralized network with independent nodes distributed around the world, many of these nodes still depend on centralized services. This introduces vulnerabilities, and reminds us that some degree of centralization is very difficult to avoid, especially as a network scales.

The main takeaway, however, is the strength of the community.

This is characteristic of open-source platforms, but is especially prominent in Ethereum, a sprawling network where all users have a vested interest in the network’s success. This means that, in this situation, all users scrambled to find a fix, some losing out on transaction opportunities and others having to walk back transactions on the minority chain.

Seeing a community come together to fix a problem is a concrete example of how spontaneous economies – that is, those that are not planned or controlled – can achieve lasting value and achieve a meaningful size.

Another takeaway is that the price of ETH did not blink. (Actually, it ended up increasing almost 3% on the day). I was watching it as this drama was unfolding, expecting it to dip sharply. After all, fear was percolating that Ethereum had “broken,” which surely would damage faith in the network’s ability to weather the upcoming protocol change.

That it did not do so is a testament to the asset’s deepening maturity, and shows that investors have their eyes on a more hopeful horizon.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

The fact that stocks didn’t do better in a week that brought very good news on the vaccine front and pushed tax increases further towards the horizon, shows that the impact of the virus on the economy is still very much a concern. Even in the best-case scenario, vaccine distribution will be complicated and fragmented, at least for the next year or so, and meanwhile the number of new cases worldwide continues to head upwards

What’s more, the potential distribution of an effective virus in near future raises some interesting dilemmas for crystal ball gazers. Will the economic boost from the renewal of activity offset the gradual removal of monetary policy support for markets?

Source: CoinDesk, FactSet

To top it all off, we seem to be heading into default season, which could get ugly for sovereigns and banks.

Bad news may be hovering but could continue to be shrugged off as monetary expansion continues to lend tailwinds to market valuations. Even the remnants of electoral uncertainty in the U.S. is not spooking the market, as lingering doubts jostle with the receding likelihood of tax increases.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, seems to be benefitting from macro trends which are contributing to the growing institutional support, spending a large part of the week above $16,000 to deliver a spectacular year-to-date performance of over 125%.

CHAIN LINKS

JPMorgan’s Global Markets Strategy team issued a report highlighting that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (managed by Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of CoinDesk’s parent DCG) has performed better in terms of flow trajectory than gold exchange-traded funds (ETF). TAKEAWAY: The data itself is impressive. Even more interesting, however, is that JPMorgan is writing a note about it, pointing out that interest in bitcoin appears to be driven by not just millennials but also by institutional investors such as family offices who look at bitcoin as an alternative to gold. Narratives like this tend to be contagious

The China Construction Bank (CCB) will issue $3 billion worth of debt securities on a blockchain, with the help of Malaysia-based digital asset exchange Fusang. These bonds will be exchangeable for bitcoin or U.S. dollars. TAKEAWAY: There is so much that is astonishing about this. First, CCB is the second-largest bank in the world, owned by the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and it is doing business with a digital asset exchange. Second, while the bank will not be handling cryptocurrency, it is aware of and appears to be supportive of people buying these bonds with bitcoin, and cashing out into the cryptocurrency (via USD). Third, the annualized interest is low, only 0.75%, but it is more than most U.S. bank dollar deposit rates, and the minimum buy-in is a retail-sized $100. And, let’s not overlook the fact that the bonds are being issued on a blockchain. And they are not being issued by an innovative tech company – they are being issued by a state-owned Chinese bank. If this is an experiment, it’s a big one, and definitely worth keeping an eye on.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor came to the attention of the crypto industry when it was revealed earlier this year that his company had invested $425 million in bitcoin as an inflation hedge. In a fireside chat with Chief Content Officer Michael Casey (worth watching, video link in article), he explained the reasoning behind his move, saying his firm’s bitcoin bet was a “rational response to a macroeconomy in chaos.” He added that hoarding gold is “an antiquated approach to storing value,” he said, and that bitcoin is “a million times better.” TAKEAWAY: It’s a refreshing viewpoint when it comes to corporate treasury management, and the company has so far done remarkably well with the bet – the value of the company’s holding has increased by over $190 million, more than the cumulative profit from the past few years. The actual impact on the bottom line has yet to be detailed, however, as the holding is valued as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.

Ray Dalio, the founder and co-chairman of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said he sees three main problems with bitcoin: that it can’t easily be used for purchases, that volatility makes merchants reluctant to accept it, and that governments will “outlaw” it should it start to become “material.” TAKEAWAY: Seriously, you’d think he’d put a bit of effort into doing some research. Bitcoin as a technology for consumer payments, and governments being afraid of it, are 2012’s arguments.

Bitcoin ATM installations have grown 85% so far this year, outpacing last year’s 50% growth. TAKEAWAY: ATMs allow people to buy bitcoin that either don’t have a bank account or don’t feel comfortable with the bank knowing that they are doing so. The amounts are small, usually less than $100 at a time; but the potential reach is broad, and the growth in ATMs is a sign of growing retail interest around the world, either for investment or payments. This is likely to end up being reflected in on-chain volumes as well as the BTC price.

The sharp growth in bitcoin-on-ethereum (wrapped bitcoin, or WBTC, is the largest of a handful of services that lock bitcoin in a contract in exchange for an Ethereum-based representation) slowed in October, but the total supply still grew a hefty 21% over the month, more than enough to absorb all newly mined bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: The slowdown is likely to be the result of the cooling down of interest in decentralized finance yields. But the growth is still substantial, and highlights the strengthening of a new use case for bitcoin: as a collateral asset on decentralized lending platforms. I expect the growth to continue to calm down over the coming months, but to still remain notably positive.

After going live last week, the deposit contract for Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade now holds over 50,000 ETH, or approximately 10% of the threshold needed to activate the transition of Ethereum from a proof-of-work blockchain to a new technical infrastructure that supports proof-of-stake. TAKEAWAY: Once Ethereum 2.0 goes live, validators (who must stake a minimum of 32 ETH) will begin earning block rewards on the new network at an estimated rate of 8%-15% annually, an attractive yield in the current environment, although the investment comes with a lock-up period and is not without risk.",2020-11-15 22:02:29+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/simple-steps-to-keep-your-crypto-safe,"As the cryptocurrency market is in the midst of a major bull run with Bitcoin (BTC) approaching its all-time highs, the security concerns of cryptocurrency self-storage are becoming more relevant than ever.

On Nov. 12, Bitcoin — the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap — surpassed a $16,000 threshold for the first time since the 2017 rally landing BTC price at an ATH of $20,000. After hitting $16,300, Bitcoin has only ever been above this price for 12 days in its entire history.

As Bitcoin is now sitting at its highest historical levels and the crypto community is anticipating more records in the near future, it is important to remember that the safety of crypto holdings very much depends on the user.

Here are some simple steps to ensure that your cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are safe in this bull market.

1. Use paper wallet or hardware wallet

As Bitcoin essentially allows to “be your own bank,” the responsibility of storing crypto mainly lies with users. A popular expression in the crypto community says “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin,” meaning that whoever holds the key phrase to a wallet, controls the coins contained therein.

Wallets come in many forms: software, hardware, and paper, each with different security considerations.

As their name suggests, software wallets are based on software, allowing users to access their crypto by installing applications on their mobile devices or a computer. As such, software wallets come in many different types like web, desktop, and mobile wallets.

While software wallets are often free and easy to use, they are not completely safe as most of them are somehow connected to the internet, which can make them vulnerable to hacking attacks or security breaches. Users should keep their apps up-to-date in order to reduce risks of possible breaches.

A paper crypto wallet is essentially a piece of paper containing a printed out crypto address and its private key in the form of QR codes generated through paper wallet websites. These codes can be scanned to execute crypto transactions. A paper wallet is highly resistant to online hacking attacks and is often considered an option to cold storage.

A hardware wallet is another sophisticated method to store crypto, isolating user private keys from the internet by keeping them offline in a USB-connected device. Also referred to as cold storage or a cold wallet, a hardware wallet is often associated with an increased level of security as private keys remain completely offline, which is designed to make them immune to any type of remote hacking. Trezor and Ledger are considered the most popular hardware wallet providers.

2. Check whether your 2FA verification is on

Don’t ignore a key additional layer of security by forgetting to turn on two-factor authentication, or 2FA, in the security settings of your wallet account. 2FA sends an additional password request to your phone or email every time you log into your wallet. By activating 2FA, a user prevents a hacker from getting immediate access to a crypto wallet account as the hacker will also need physical access to the user's phone or email.

Google Authenticator is the one of the most popular 2FA applications providing users two-step verification on a phone.

3. Never share your private keys

Don’t ever give your private keys or a seed phrase to anyone. By doing so, you’d be essentially giving away the keys to the castle. Remember that reputable crypto companies will never ask you for your keys even when trying to help you resolve issues.

4. Be sure the recipient wallet is correct

Always check a recipient address before proceeding with a transaction. A simple one letter mistake could direct your transaction to another wallet. In contrast to some traditional financial services, most crypto transactions are irreversible. Some malware is also capable of changing the right destination of your crypto, so a double-check of transaction details is never redundant.

5. Don’t fall for giveaway scams

Don’t ever fall for offers sounding like “send us Bitcoin and get double your Bitcoin back.” This type of attack is quite commonon Twitter, with attackers frequently impersonating celebrities, politicians, or crypto personalities promising to double user’s crypto fortune.

As this type of attack is often associated with crypto newcomers, it might get even more exposure with an increasing crypto adoption. In July 2020, online hackers managed to collect at least 12 BTC in a high-profile hack of Twitter accounts like Elon Musk as well as 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden.

6. Use smaller transactions and different exchanges

Don’t send a bunch of crypto in one single transaction when you need to buy or sell crypto on a crypto exchange. If you need to transact a big amount of money in crypto, better break it up into multiple transactions to be sure that an exchange is working properly.

While all of these security layers and double-checking might seem tedious, they're the key to making sure your funds remain secure.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/169155-crypto-market-reaches-highest-valuation-since-may-2018-as-bitcoin-hit-35-month-high-of-16400-report/,"Binance, the world’s largest digital asset exchange, says it hasn’t seen Bitcoin (BTC) this “expensive” since December 2017. The leading blockchain firm along with the rest of the crypto industry is now wondering whether Bitcoin will be setting another all-time high (after trading for nearly $20,000 almost three years back).

Binance notes in its latest crypto market report that Bitcoin began the past weekend moving at around $15,500 and throughout this past week, it had steadily climbed to a price range that we haven’t seen in a few years. Just a few hours after hitting a 35-month high of $16,400, Bitcoin managed to close the week trading at $16,200, Binance confirmed.

The exchange further noted:

“Ethereum is experiencing high volatility throughout the whole week. ETH hit a weekly low of $420 before quickly bouncing up to around $470 by the week’s end. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) reached its weekly high on Saturday at almost $30, before quickly dropping to a weekly low of $27.”

The cryptocurrency ecosystem’s total market cap began the week at $443 billion, with “a slight upwards movement throughout the week, before reaching $464 billion on Friday, the highest point since May 2018,” the report from Binance noted.

As mentioned in the exchange’s report, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) recently indicted two individuals who were allegedly responsible for an attempted hack on Binance’s trading platform back in March 2018. The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions targeting the hackers. Binance confirmed that it awarded a $200,000 bounty for the DOJ indictment of attackers who allegedly carried out the 2018 phishing campaign.

Like many other crypto industry participants, Binance is now trying to determine whether Bitcoin (BTC) will finally be “going mainstream.”

The exchange noted:

“As Bitcoin recently crossed $16,000, amid an astounding 122.2% growth since the beginning of the year, some crypto observers think that mass adoption is getting closer given the amount of interest BTC is gaining from several institutions.”

Bitcoin is not only approaching highs that it set back in 2017, but it’s also being adopted by major institutions such as established investment companies, hedge funds, and publicly-listed firms.

As noted by Binance, here are several major organizations and individuals that have acquired Bitcoin (or announced support for crypto) with many calling it their “primary reserve asset”:

Grayscale Investments began reporting their BTC holdings with the U.S. SEC in January 2020. At the beginning of this year, Grayscale declared $2 billion in BTC assets under management (AUM). The digital asset manager currently holds over 500,000 BTC, valued at well over $7 billion at current prices.

Paul Tudor Jones, a prominent hedge fund manager, revealed in May 2020 that around 2% of his total assets are allocated towards Bitcoin. His BVI Global Fund reportedly manages $22 billion in assets.

MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed asset manager, confirmed that it has acquired $425 million in BTC (as of September 2020).

Square, the crypto-friendly payment platform, stated last month that it had put 1% of its total assets, valued $50 million, in Bitcoin.

Stone Ridge Holdings, the manager of $10 billion in funds, also stated last month that it’s now holding $114 million worth of BTC as a reserve asset.

In October 2020, PayPal confirmed that it was planning to let its customers purchase and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies (it appears that this service has now been introduced).",2020-11-16 00:00:00,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-in-2021-institutions-prefer-bitcoin-retail-open-to-al-8315.htm,"Source: Adobe/hakinmhan

2020 has been the best year for cryptoasset investment since 2017, while there’s even an argument that it’s the best year ever, given that the growth of the crypto market seems steadier and more stable this time out. But what about next year?

For the most part, 2021 is shaping up to be almost as eventful and turbulent as 2020. The coronavirus is expected to stay with us for some time to come, and in response governments are likely to continue pushing macroeconomic policies — quantitative easing and low interest rates — that will make bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptoassets more attractive to investors.

According to industry figures speaking with Cryptonews.com, 2021 will almost certainly bring an increase of institutions, corporations and consumers investing in crypto. But if BTC continues its rally, retail investors in particular might invest sideways as well, increasing their exposure to new and established altcoins.

2020: what was expected

Rewind to the end of 2019, and you may recall industry players telling Cryptonews.com that institutions would increasingly invest in bitcoin in 2020, while mostly sidestepping altcoins. They also expected retail investors to be more open to altcoins.

Well, they were broadly correct in these predictions: the likes of MicroStrategy, Square, and Stone Ridge Management all converted portions of their cash reserves into bitcoin, while we also saw financial institutions increase their exposure to the cryptocurrency. The moves arguably weren’t widespread, but they appear to have set the ball rolling for more.

Likewise, the coronavirus pandemic — and the increase in saving which followed — drove retail investors towards bitcoin. But given the strong growth witnessed by such upstarts as Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA), it’s also apparent that retail investors had more of an appetite for altcoins than institutions and corporations.

2021: BTC love in the time of pandemic

2020 has laid a strong foundation for cryptoasset investment to take off next year.

As Konstantin Richter, the CEO and Founder of Blockdaemon told Cryptonews.com, “More institutions and liquidity providers are rapidly entering the space and the investments in bitcoin appear to be strong.”

“This trend is likely to continue, and increase momentum in 2021, with announcements by the likes of PayPal offering crypto payments in 2021 … more users will have access to experiment with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” he added.

For the most part, the macroeconomic environment — increased savings, higher inflation, lower interest rates — will mean that bitcoin receives the lion’s share of institutional and retail investment.

“Now, the DeFi movement and [altcoin] season are stumbling and the bitcoin dominance index is creeping up again; during these turbulent times, investors are placing their money on a safer bet,” said OKEx CEO Jay Hao.

With the ongoing uncertainty over the pandemic, the US election, Brexit and other factors, Hao estimated that it’s “likely more investors will turn to BTC as a safer haven,” as opposed to other cryptoassets.

Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency market analyst at eToro, agrees with this assessment:

“I think a lot of whether bitcoin continues to increase its market dominance percentage into 2021 will have a lot to do with developments in the coronavirus pandemic.”

“If we continue to see further lockdowns and, more importantly, economies needing to be kept above water by governments and central banks providing stimulus packages, leading to more quantitative easing, then it could prompt further investment into bitcoin,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Trading sideways with altcoins

However, while this might seem like a gloomy assessment as far as altcoins are concerned, it is estimated that increased liquidity in bitcoin will trickle down or filter out towards the rest of the crypto market.

“What we have typically seen is that after BTC surges and then eventually starts to trade sideways, investors diversify into [altcoins], and [altcoins] begin to rise in the longer term,” said Jay Hao.

Nicholas Merten, the founder of one of the most popular Youtube channels on crypto investments, DataDash, and Digifox, a finance app, also said that at least a portion of new investment will find its way to altcoins.

“We tend to find that bitcoin's dominance grows as it's approaching all-time highs in price from the previous bull market and drops sharply afterwards. This is due to liquidity or ""new money"" initially surging into bitcoin, then eventually flowing out into other altcoins, rather than dollars,” he told Cryptonews.com.

Merten added that once bitcoin returns to its previous all-time high of USD 20,000, he suspects we’ll see altcoins spiking.

Konstantin Richter is of the same opinion that altcoins will benefit from increased investment in DeFi platforms, which he sees as entering a maturation phase next year.

“Institutional adoption of cryptocurrency has proven to be a significant driver for adoption by retail users. If DeFi can mature and manage to attract similar mainstream investment, there are likely to be huge opportunities for early adopters of the technology in the coming year,” he said.

What kinds of institutions and corporations?

But when we say “institutional” investment, what do we mean? Well, in 2021, such investment will cover an increasingly wide portion of the financial and corporate world.

“In my opinion, corporate treasurers, especially Silicon Valley startups, will begin seriously exploring bitcoin as a reserve asset for their balance sheets in 2021 and 2022,” said Nicholas Merten.

“Once [it] reaches back to its all-time highs, it turns the narrative from ‘bitcoin was in a bubble’ to ‘bitcoin was just warming up’,” he added.

Simon Peters agrees that more companies will invest in bitcoin as a reserve asset, with the eToro analyst suggesting that most of these companies are “initially going to be those whose founders are bitcoin advocates, like we saw with Microstrategy and Square.”

But Jay Hao also expects financial institutions, hedge funds and even banks to increase their bitcoin exposure in 2021.

“I think 2021 may see the final green light of a bitcoin ETF, exposing more and more traditional investors to bitcoin as well. Banks too, will likely step up their strategies when it comes to bitcoin and we see more countries follow the US’ lead and begin to custody bitcoin,” he said.

Retail different from institutions

This sounds very bullish for BTC, but again, we’ll likely see retail investors picking up the slack for altcoins in 2021, investing with a greater appetite for risk than institutions.

Moreover, some altcoins such as chainlink and tezos (XTZ) are down in double digits from their recent all-time highs “and have only really gotten started,” according to Simon Peters.

“Many retail investors may feel there is a lot more potential to come from these altcoin projects, especially when you consider how far bitcoin has come in the last few years,” he said.

Peters also expects retail investors to increasingly invest in altcoins which enable staking.

He added, “Services like staking, that are available on coins with a proof of stake mechanism and offer an annual yield in a low interest environment, could also provide retail investor impetus into coins other than bitcoin.”

In other words, 2021 is estimated to bring more institutions and corporations to bitcoin, while retail investors looking for the newest thing might provide the investment that helps altcoins and the DeFi sector to grow.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin Cash plummeted 10% in an hour following the controversial hard fork.

The fair value of the fork according to miners’ support is $155 and $95, but many exchanges are refusing to support the minor chain.

Traders can expect extreme volatility in both BCHN and BCHABC prices until the two chains reach stability.

Share this article

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork to two separate chains—BCHN and BCHABC—is complete, and the support from miners is split 60% and 37% among the two competing sides. Unlike common voting, the majority does not kill the minority chain.

Instead, two versions of the chain continue to exist as long as miners and users transact on the network.

The Bitcoin Cash Chain Spilt

From block number 661,648, there are two blockchains of Bitcoin Cash—BCHN and BCHABC.

The block times on BCH increased far beyond the normal ten-minute production cycle after the event.

A sudden drop in hashrate of 40% to the dominant chain and the time needed for miners to upgrade their networks saw only four new blocks on the primary chain in the first 90 minutes after the fork.

The first and main part of today’s upgrade is aserti3-2d DAA, which will change BCH’s mining difficulty adjustment. The new adjustment mechanism aims to smoothen the oscillations in mining difficulty on BCH for a gradual change.

Mining difficulty is directly proportional to the hashrate of the network. The increase or decrease in the difficulty helps in maintaining the block confirmation time to ten minutes.

Presently, the mining difficulty for BCHN is destined to drop with the exit of BCHABC miners.

Crypto Scrip Issue

While BCHN enjoys support from top exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase, its stability will remain an issue as miners fluctuate between both chains. Many exchanges like Binance will also support the majority chain, with the option of claiming minority chain tokens on and after Nov. 15.

A hard fork or chain split is similar to a scrip share issue for an investor. In a scrip issue, shareholders are given new shares proportional to their holdings for free. The par value, or fair value, drops in proportion to the dilution from the new shares issued.

Bitcoin Cash’s case is a 1:1 issue, where 100 BCH would earn 100 BCHN and 100 BCHABC. If it were a share, the par value BCH would have reduced by half from the value before the chain split, which was $255.

Moreover, if one calculated the price based on the percentage of miner support for and against the controversial “miner tax,” the perceived value of BCHN and BCHAB should be around $155 and $95, respectively.

Volatility and Fear of Manipulation

However, the market value of tokens depends more on speculation than fair value. Due to a lack of liquidity in BCHABC from limited listing on crypto exchanges, its price is bound to remain volatile for the next few weeks.

For instance, after the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV hard fork in November 2019, BSV exhibited considerable volatility because it was the minor chain. Still, Bitcoin Cash dropped over 80% in the month following the event, despite coming out as the dominant chain.

The miner support via hashrate, difficulty, and transaction volume on the competing chains are the primary on-chain indicators. However, uncertainty is likely to prevail on that front as well.

The market saw a glimpse of that volatility as BCH fell 10% in the hour following the fork. It is currently changing hands at $242.

Share this article",2020-11-15 17:32:53+00:00,https://decrypt.co/48327/belarus-launches-cryptocurrency-exchange-while-tech-industry-collapses,"In brief The state-owned bank of Belarus has reportedly launched a crypto exchange, letting customers buy Bitcoin.

The crypto exchange may be part of a wider government aim to boost the country’s tech sector.

Despite sustained growth over the recent years, the tech sector now flees the country following a summer of violent anti-government protests.

The state-owned bank of Belarus, Europe’s most authoritarian country but equally one of the friendliest toward cryptocurrencies, this week launched a cryptocurrency exchange, per local media outlet PrimePress.

The exchange, a partnership between Belarusbank and White Bird, a local cryptocurrency firm, lets Belarusians and Russians buy Bitcoin with a Visa payment card.

The launch is the latest signal that the Belarusian government welcomes crypto—but whereas the government once used crypto to charm tech workers to the country two years ago, unrest in the post-Soviet nation may drown out its ""open for business"" messaging.

Belarus's crypto play started in 2018, when the government legalized cryptocurrency trading and granted tax exemptions to individuals and businesses.

It was part of a viral marketing campaign to entice tech companies to set up shop in the country with the promise that it would leave them alone—with much success.

In 2019, the latest year of statistics, Belarus had 1,500 tech companies, accounting for 5.7% of the Belarusian GDP and 50% of its growth last year.

However, many tech workers fled the nation after violent protests broke out this summer when Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s president, sought a sixth term in office.

Lukashenko was secretly sworn in late September; protests continue.

“There are now reports of most software companies moving their operations to Russia, and with that, many engineers relocating to either Russia, Ukraine, or the Baltic states,” Filip Rambousek, a London-based political analyst of Eastern Europe, told Decrypt.

PandaDoc, a large documentation automation firm, had four of its managers in Minsk jailed for supporting the protests. Later, the company conducted an internal survey and found that 8 in 10 of its employees, many Belarusians, simply wanted to leave the country. The office has now relocated to Ukraine.

The protests, and the government’s brutal response to them, knocked out the country’s tech industry. Many of the tech sector workers, generally sympathetic to the anti-Lukashenko movement, are now gone.

“The software industry is the only sector that had actually prospered under Lukashenko, and it’s now collapsed,” Rambousek told Decrypt.

Tech has become the country's major export; last year, its tech industry was worth $2 billion.

Joe Mooney, a Russia and former Soviet Union analyst at the London-based corporate investigations firm C&F Partners, told Decrypt, ""Tech is the only industry in Belarus that is largely left alone by the government,"" and that it prospered as a result.

In August, more than 2,500 tech CEOs, developers, and investors signed a petition in support of the protests and raised alarm bells about the future of tech in the country.

Mooney said, “The state's partnership in this venture may indicate plans to increasingly interfere in this sector of the economy in light of tech businesses' support for recent protests, but also an awareness that the country's economic development depends on growth and innovation in this area.”

Lebanon to Launch Digital Currency in 2021

Lebanon’s central bank has become the latest monetary regulator to move towards the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and is planning for a launch next year.

According to reports on Tuesday, the initiative of the central bank was confirmed by its governor, Riad Salameh. He believes that this move will reinstate public confidence in the Lebanese banking industry and transition into a cashless system.

Lebanon’s economy is currently in crisis, and the ties of private banks with its government also created chaos as the country defaulted on its debts in March. The governor pointed out that the Lebanese citizens now store around $10 billion in cash in their homes.

Despite this, cryptocurrencies still remain a gray area in the economy. Since 2014, Ukrainian authorities have been trying to implement crypto legislation that would transform the country into a competitive jurisdiction for running crypto-related businesses, but the efforts did not yield any results. Finally, just a few months ago, the Ukranian government presented a new bill on digital assets to legitimize the sector — and this time, the attempt may well be successful.

The fintech strategy of the Ukrainian central bank, or NBU, pledged to legalize activities using cryptocurrencies. According to the document, by 2025, crypto assets will fully enter the legislative field and a transparent infrastructure will be created to allow it to operate on the market.

The first steps on this path were taken in late 2019. Since then, parliament members have passed a law on implementing the Financial Action Task Force’s standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Among other things, the standards contain the concept of digital assets.

New attempts to legalize crypto

The new bill seems to outline a solid action plan and delegates responsibilities. It clearly states that the governmental Ministry of Digital Transformation will be the main regulator controlling and monitoring any activity using crypto assets. As for tracking suspicious crypto transactions, the department has already agreed to cooperate with blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain BV, developed by Bitfury Group.

As expected, digital assets are not considered as a means of payment in the new bill. It is rather described as an intangible asset, a kind of power of attorney for property with which any operation can be performed, except for payment.

The document’s authors tried to advise on all areas of usage of digital assets, ranging from initial coin offerings to initial exchange offerings (albeit belatedly) to stablecoins and other possible tokenized assets. Not limited only to this, the new bill describes all the rights and requirements related to custodians of digital assets, including exchanges, multi-signature wallets and any organization that now works and thrives in the crypto environment.

Given that crypto adoption in Ukraine is growing rapidly, particularly in the decentralized finance and decentralized autonomous organization infrastructures, it is crucial that the new legislation highlights the difference between these two spaces. What is particularly interesting is the possibility of regulating the work of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.

However, if the new Ukrainian regulations don’t cover DAO features, the voting rights given to users making decisions within a DAO may be considered illegal. This shows the importance of why processes such as voting on protocol governance should be established in the law.

Digital assets as a new possibility for the Ukrainian capital market

Since there is now a well-defined concept of a secured digital asset, the bill’s authors have a stake in the development of tokenized ecosystems. These may also include tokenized securities under the National Securities and Stock Market Commission’s jurisdiction, a government agency that will also have the authority to regulate transactions with digital assets.

The most interesting projects will be related to bonds. Since Ukraine is actively engaged in issuing government bonds, a large number of brokers and banks are selling them to their clients as an alternative to deposits — the main investment instrument available to Ukrainians.

Given that the NBU is the custodian of securities for government bonds, this body will also be involved in the legal process if these bonds are tokenized. Such cooperation will make it possible to create infrastructure projects, thereby reviving the securities market and making it more transparent and accessible for individuals.

What’s next?

Although the bill is awaiting a vote, this is the first step to making Ukraine a competitive country for the crypto business, and at the very least, a favorable environment for the development of the domestic market. Thanks to the new legislative conditions, legal entities whose activities focus on digital assets will now be able to open bank accounts and work freely by exchanging and/or issuing digital assets.

In addition to the possibility of launching a tokenized securities market, the strategic development of the fintech market from the NBU also suggests how national infrastructure projects will develop. According to the document, by 2025, the regulator will issue a central bank digital currency dubbed e-hryvnia. This idea is already included in the bill “On Payment Services,” and unlike today’s digital assets, the CBDC will be considered legal tender.

As interest in cryptocurrency builds and the U.S. dollar weakens, Bitcoin rose seven percent and was trading above $15,000 per coin. At its highest bidding price in nearly three years, Bitcoin has more than doubled in 2020.

Why it Matters: If Bitcoin continues to surge, the cryptocurrency will reach an all time high, topping out at $20,000. At the same time, mainstream financial institutions like PayPal and Square are embracing cryptocurrencies as viable payment methods and investments. Along with Bitcoin, gold will remain highly valued through 2020 and in the future.

In a blog post on Thursday, Director of Research Ria Bhutoria said she was addressing persistent “criticisms and misconceptions” about the cryptocurrency. These include whether bitcoin is too volatile to be a store of value, has failed as a means of payment and is environmentally wasteful.

“Bitcoin’s volatility is a trade-off [that] makes for perfect supply inelasticity and an intervention-free market,” she said, but with greater adoption and introduction of derivatives and investment products, volatility may continue to drop.

According to the Bhutoria, the world’s first cryptocurrency’s “core” use case isn’t in payments. However, it uses its limited capacity for settling transactions that aren’t well-served by traditional rails, and offers “high settlement assurances.”

“Limited throughput is the trade-off bitcoin makes for decentralization, which is a direct result of cheap and easy validation,” she wrote.

The post responds to bitcoin’s reputation for sucking up vast amounts of energy in the mining process, arguing a “substantial portion” of its power consumption comes from renewable sources. Further, the energy it does expend is a “valid and important” use.

“Bitcoin transactions connected to illicit activity are very low,” Bhutoria went on, addressing a common criticism of cryptocurrencies in general. Like cash, bitcoin is “neutral and has properties that may be valuable to good actors and bad actors,” she said.

As for the argument that bitcoin isn’t backed by anything, such as real-world assets, it is in fact “backed by code and the consensus that exists among its key stakeholders” was Bhutoria’s response.

“Bitcoin has accelerated to the upside on positive short-term momentum, upholding overbought conditions following its recent breakout above former resistance from 2019,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.

Momentum, as measured in the form of volume, was at $688 million as of press time, higher than the past month’s $404 million daily average on major spot exchanges.

“The next resistance is final resistance from 2017 near $19,500,” Stockton added. Based on CoinDesk 20 data, the last time bitcoin was at this price level was back on Jan. 6, 2018, when the daily high was at $17,211.

In addition to bitcoin’s bullish run, global equities were also up Monday across the board, boosted by positive economic news – and promising results for another COVID-19 vaccine – in the face of a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic:

According to several analysts, the climbing value of bitcoin is also giving the world’s oldest cryptocurrency an increasing use as value storage for lending, both from centralized players and in decentralized finance, or DeFi. Since November 2019, the amount of bitcoin “locked” in DeFi, for example, has skyrocketed from 1,422 to 174,673 BTC, a 12,183% increase.

“Lending has gained popularity in 2020 with players like Nexo, BlockFi and others with strong growth throughout the year,” said Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “DeFi also allows the retail market to access those popular lending solutions thanks to the Ethereum network.”

“It actually provides a strong use case for BTC beyond the digital gold narrative, as it’s used as a pooling and yielding instrument,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of crypto exchange Alpha5. Shah also speculates that all this bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain may decrease the separation between blockchains. “It may actually create a chain-agnostic paradigm.”

Uniswap, tether dominate Ethereum transactions

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday trading around $462 and climbing 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Since the start of July, the Ethereum network has been averaging over one million transactions per day, according to data aggregator Glassnode. That number of transactions was first experienced three years ago during the 2017-2018 crypto market bubble.

Token swapping and stablecoins are a big part of this, as 35% of the network’s transactions are on Uniswap (18.93%) and involve tether (16.42%) on Monday, according to Eth Gas Station.

“I think this is proof of the continued traction that Ethereum has been seeing as a platform during the second half of 2020,” noted Ben Chan, vice president of engineering for oracle provider ChainLink.

Uniswap’s transaction dominance in particular is a bullish sign on decentralized finance, or DeFi, according to Chan. “Unlike tether, which can move to other chains, DeFi is more sticky because assets and components of the ecosystem in themselves perpetuate a network effect.”

Investors in the cryptocurrency market have started to count days to the end of the year. The usual end of the year rally is expected to elevate crypto assets to higher levels, with Bitcoin possibly lifting off to a new all-time high above $20,000. The launch of Ethereum 2.0 is also a fundamental bullish indicator that the smart contract token may rally massively above $500.

On the other hand, investors anticipate that Ripple would follow Ethereum and Bitcoin's footsteps and rally towards $1. Selected tokens in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector have commenced their end of year rallies. Some of these tokens include SushiSwap, Uniswap and Aave.

Bitcoin on the verge of the ultimate breakout above $17,000

The flagship cryptocurrency slipped beneath $15,000 again over the weekend, but immense buyer congestion marginally above the 50 Simple Moving Average cut short the bearish leg. BTC resumed the uptrend shortly after and topped $16,000 on Monday during the Asian session.

At the time of writing, the king of cryptocurrencies is trading at $16,268 amid a building bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index adds credibility to the optimistic outlook as it recovers above the midline.

Bitcoin bulls are looking forward to sending the price above $17,000, but first, the resistance at $16,500 (new yearly high) must come down. More hurdles might come into the picture above $17,000, but the fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to catapult Bitcoin to new all-time highs.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

Meanwhile, the bullish narrative will be invalidated if Bitcoin slumps under $16,000 again. The bearish price action is likely to trigger more sell orders. If Bitcoin breaks below the crucial 50 SMA support, we can expect losses to extend to the 100 SMA, currently at $15,000.

Ethereum to spike to $480 if the immediate hurdle is broken

The largest altcoin recovered from the support established at $440, following a rejection from $480. Following the rebound, ETH is doddering at $445, while bulls deal with the 50 SMA resistance.

Closing above this zone could add credibility to the recovery mission eyeing $480. Consolidation is likely to come into play in the near term, as highlighted by the RSI's levelling motion at the midline.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

The bearish outlook will hold in the event the smart contract token closes the day under the 50 SMA. Exhaustion might engulf the bullish camp leaving Ethereum's bullish scenario vulnerable in bears' hands. Declines could revisit the recent support at $440. On the other hand, if sell orders surge, Ether will be forced to explore the next support targets at the 100 SMA and 200 SMA.

Ripple prints a bearish pattern

The cross-border token has rallied extensively from the lows in November; nonetheless, the change remains small compared to Bitcoin's. The resistance between $0.26 and $0.27 was finally overcome, allowing XRP to exchange hands at a monthly high of $0.278. Meanwhile, XRP retreated to confirm support at $0.265 before recovering slightly to $0.273 (overall market value).

XRP/USD 4-hour chart brings to light the formation of an ascending wedge pattern. The chart pattern is created by connecting an asset's higher highs and higher lows with trendlines. It is used in technical analysis to signal that an uptrend is losing momentum and a correction could be brewing.

If XRP fails to break above the hurdle at $0.28 and push towards $0.3, bearish pressure may begin to surge as sell orders balloon. On the downside, price action under the wedge pattern will seek support at the 50 SMA, currently at $0.26 and the 200 SMA, at $0.25.

It is worth noting that the bearish picture will be sabotaged if Ripple rises above $0.28, as well as the wedge pattern resistance. Crossing above $0.3 might trigger massive buy orders and investors are likely to join the market to capitalize on the rally.

On Monday, crypto industry blogger Colin Wu tweeted that miners in China have been struggling to pay for electricity after the authorities started cracking down on over-the-counter (OTC) brokers in the country.

The tweet notes that “74% of the miners surveyed told Wu that the payment of electricity bills has been greatly affected.” China recently started blocking bank accounts and cards involved in purchases of cryptocurrency, and has investigated the two largest brokers, Zhao Dong and Xu Mingxing, Wu wrote in a blog post.

It’s currently a “challenge” for Chinese miners to convert bitcoin or tether into yuan because “many people have had their bank accounts frozen when exchanging crypto for [renminbi] on OTC platforms,” said Thomas Heller, formerly global business director at the mining pool F2Pool and now chief operation officer of mining and media firm HASHR8.

As CoinDesk reported, in June, Chinese authorities ramped up efforts to block bank accounts that could be connected to illicit activities such as money laundering via cryptocurrency deals.

“It has always happened, but this year more than others,” Heller told CoinDesk. “I would say it has become more common in the last couple months.”

However, he played down the scale of any exodus of miners from China, even though HASHR8 is currently helping some operators to move their operations – most to Russia but some to Kazakhstan.

“Most Chinese miners are mostly only familiar with the Chinese market, so it’s hard for them to move abroad and start mining,” Heller explained. “It’s [the China OTC clampdown] another factor that may make overseas mining more attractive, however this alone is not enough to push them overseas. Rather, they would try to find some workarounds.”

In the meantime, some operators are unplugging their miners, Wu wrote in a blog post. “There are also miners who said that their mining machines have been shut down for a month because they cannot sell the cryptocurrency to pay the electricity bill.”

Some OTC companies that specialize on serving mining firms “have also terminated their business,” Wu wrote.",2020-11-16 14:32:53+00:00,https://decrypt.co/48348/skype-co-founder-keeps-personal-wealth-in-bitcoin-ethereum,"In brief Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn holds most of his wealth in cryptocurrency.

The Estonian engineer donated 350 Ethereum and 50 Bitcoin to UK-based firm Faculty AI in 2018–2020.

The company still holds on to most of the crypto it received from Tallinn.

Jaan Tallinn, an Estonian engineer who was one of the co-founders of Skype, is holding most of his personal wealth in cryptocurrency—and had been for some time now, according to an article published by Fortune on Friday.

Since Skype was sold to eBay for around $2.6 billion in 2005, Tallinn has not launched any new enterprises but has invested in many. One of them was Faculty AI, a London-based company focused on machine-learning systems, which received digital assets from Tallinn on at least two occasions.

Per the report, while Tallinn’s investment company Metaplanet Holdings backed Faculty in the past and holds around 9% of its shares, the Skype co-founder also gifted the UK firm thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency. In January 2018, Tallinn gave Faculty 350 Ethereum (ETH) (worth around $434,000 at the time and roughly $160,000 today).

In March 2020, the engineer followed up with a 50 Bitcoin (BTC) gift—this one was worth about $316,000, according to Faculty’s public financial filings, but has surged to over $810,000 during the recent Bitcoin rally.

Since he holds most of his personal funds in crypto anyway, he told the outlet, it was much easier to invest that way. Selling the coins for cash would have incurred capital gains tax and reduced the amount of money Tallinn was able to give to Faculty.

In the end, the transfer proved to be much trickier for the UK firm itself since traditional bookkeeping is not entirely up to speed with the rapidly developing world of digital assets.

“Our accountants had to go and find someone else who was working on crypto and how to do accounting for crypto,” Faculty’s founder and CEO Marc Warner told the outlet.

Since then, the company sold around $144,000 worth of Ethereum in 2019–2020 but reportedly held onto most of the crypto it received from Tallinn. While Ethereum is still far from its late 2017–early 2018 highs, Bitcoin’s price is certainly getting back there.",2020-11-16 10:48:31,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-corrections-examined-what-to-expect-when-crypto-corrects/,"Bitcoin Bitcoin Bull Market Corrections Examined: What To Expect When Crypto Corrects

For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is back in a bull market. But even bull markets don’t always simply move upward in a straight line. Along the way, the road gets rocky, and violent and volatile corrections wipe out weeks of progress made in a matter of one or two.

Data shows that past bull market corrections average roughly 37% in downside, according to iconic career commodities trader Peter Brandt. If a similar correction follows the recent rally, here is the potential target for the bottom of what is likely to be a short-lived spike down, along with a look at why the cryptocurrency corrects to such a specific price point in bull markets.

Pro Trader Peter Brandt Points To Possible 37% Correction In Bitcoin Based On Past Bull Markets

Bitcoin price is up 20% in November 2020 alone. From the early September bottom to the recent high, in less than three months the leading cryptocurrency by market cap added more than 65% to its total value per BTC.

Since the Black Thursday bottom, Bitcoin has risen over 330%. The last seven weekly candles have been green and price action has gone parabolic. At this point, it is becoming difficult to deny that the top crypto asset is beginning another bull run.

RELATED READING | BLOOMBERG SENIOR STRATEGIST: BITCOIN MAY TURN “PARABOLIC” IN 2021

But even Bitcoin corrects during bull markets, and when it does, the results can be violent. According to Peter Brandt, who famously predicted the over 80% decline from top to bottom based on nothing but data from past parabolic breakdowns, Bitcoin bull market corrections decline roughly 37% on average.

During the 2015-2017 bull market in Bitcoin $BTC, there were 9 significant corrections with the following averages: 37% decline from high to low

14 weeks from one ATH to the next ATH Since the early Sep low there have been two 10% corrections pic.twitter.com/E1LbN7VDa5 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) November 16, 2020

Brandt warns that there were nine “significant corrections” during the last bull market, while this time around, the cryptocurrency has only had two 10% pullbacks. Each correction is roughly 14 weeks from a new peak to peak. Currently, the cryptocurrency is on week twelve in a row without anything meaningful for a correction.

Reading between the lines, Brandt is warning that a correction is coming and that buyers need to beware.

Bull market corrections average to about 37% according to data | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com

Why The Cryptocurrency Appears To Crash To The Same Key Level During Bull Runs

Brandt’s data and the Bitcoin price chart itself, show an average of roughly 37%. Most corrections according to our interpretation of the chart above, resulted in a 40% drop. Crashes typically lasted less than a month in most examples.

But why the recurring number when it comes to cryptocurrency bull market corrections? The answer can be found in mathematics, potentially.

RELATED READING | NEARLY 99% OF BITCOIN OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN PROFITABLE, DATA REVEALS

Bitcoin corrects roughly 37-40% when it does finally pull back. That range is a sweet spot for the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level or roughly 61.8% of the initial rally.

It is not clear why this mathematical relationship with price action exists but can be used strategically to find potential levels where support may exist and buyers could show up with strength.

Each crash falls back to the 0.618 Fibonacci level | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com

The level could be intuitively an attractive value to investors at that point, prompting the sudden interest. A drop of such magnitude at current levels would take Bitcoin price back to roughly $11,500, and as you can see below that price points sandwiched between the 0.618 level from all-time high and the 2020 rally, and over three years worth of bear market resistance.

(Kitco News) Bitcoin is quietly making its way back to its record highs of nearly $20,000, rising $4,000 in November alone.

On Tuesday, bitcoin continued its massive rally, breaching $17,000 for the first time in almost three years. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was trading at $17,506, up 4.71% on the day.

The next significant resistance level for bitcoin will be its record high of nearly $20,000, last seen at the end of 2017, said Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone.

""$20,000 bitcoin is primary hurdle toward $1 trillion market cap,"" McGlone wrote on Monday, adding that the cryptocurrency is likely to continue its climb higher next year. ""Bitcoin, the digital version of gold but with more-limited supply and a history of adding zeros, appears to be in an early price-discovery stage and may simply continue its ascent in 2021,"" he said.

Pushing bitcoin higher is mainstream adoption, McGlone added, noting that the market could see $40,000 bitcoin as soon as next year.

""History suggests it should be a matter of time for bitcoin to reach a $1 trillion market cap vs. about $300 billion on Nov. 13. Increasing demand, adoption and interest vs. diminishing supply suggest the crypto will stay the course. Our graphic depicts its market-cap regression line since $10 billion in 2013 is on pace for $1 trillion in about 2022, implying a price around $55,000 vs. the current level around $16,000. If the future rhymes with the post-halving years of 2013 and 2017, and we factor maturity of about a quarter of the 2017 advance, Bitcoin may reach $40,000 in 2021,"" McGlone wrote.

Citibank's forecasts on bitcoin are even more aggressive lately, with a recent report not ruling out a move above $300,000 by December 2021.

Citi managing director Thomas Fitzpatrick said: ""The whole existence of bitcoin has been characterized by unthinkable rallies followed by painful corrections (the type of pattern that sustains a long term trend).""

Fitzpatrick compared bitcoin to the 1970s gold market. ""That period with regard to the gold price was a structural change in the modern-day monetary regime as it broke the orthodox relationship between fiat currencies and gold, ushering in a world of fiscal indiscipline, deficits and inflation,"" Fitzpatrick wrote.

Citi's note to clients was first leaked by Twitter user 'ClassicMacro'.

As bitcoin breached $17,000, Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder and co-chairman of the largest hedge fund in the world Bridgewater Associates, tweeted that he ""might be missing something about bitcoin,"" noting that he does not view bitcoin as an effective currency.

""It's not very good as a store-hold of wealth because its volatility is great and has little correlation with the prices of what I need to buy,"" Dalio said.",2020-11-17 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/17/bitcoin-jumps-to-three-year-high-as-covid-crisis-changes-investor-outlook,"Bitcoin, the world’s best known cryptocurrency, jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high on Tuesday as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets.

The currency climbed more than 4% to $17,492, its highest level since December 2017 and more than four times higher than the price in March when heavy selling sent its value below $4,000.

Analysts said the pandemic had encouraged investors to review the long-term outlook for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin and XRP, which have all increased in value in recent months.

Concerns about fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies and a succession of hacks that prompted cryptocurrency exchanges to lose millions of dollars worth of coins, appear to have waned, giving investors a greater sense of security.

“The virus crisis is propagating the reassessment of bitcoin,” said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan. “There is a reassessment about its value here as an alternative currency; as an alternative to gold.”

Gold set an all-time high in August of $2,072 per ounce, but has since waned to $1,885.

While some investors have sought a safe haven, others have seen bitcoin as a growth asset that can perform strongly in an era of low returns from government bonds.

Central bank stimulus measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic have cut interest rates to below zero in many parts of the world, leaving only minimal returns on lending to governments.

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21m. Proponents say its scarcity provides an innate value and shields it from central bank or government policies that stoke inflation.

Some investors have become concerned that inflation will spiral next year following a rush of new Covid-19 vaccines that allow governments to boost their economies.



Also supporting prices, investors said, were expectations that bitcoin was being embraced by mainstream companies and moving towards widespread use as means of payment.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is a 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Invented in 2008, you store your bitcoins in a digital wallet, and transactions are stored in a public ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the digital currency being double-spent. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In January 2021 the UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers they should be prepared to lose all their money if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. In January 2021 it hit a record high of above $40,000, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.

Bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint of the system. New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins there are, the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process.

Last month, PayPal said it would open its network to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has risen by nearly half since PayPal’s move.

“The ultimate endorsement of crypto is whether you can buy your groceries with it and pay taxes with it,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “That would be the ultimate acceptance.”

Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, said bitcoin’s value was likely to increase over the rest of the year.

“It has broken through the critical price milestone of $17,000 and looks set to move higher.”

He added: “It is not out of the question for the crypto to hit its all-time high of $20,000 this side of Christmas.”

The last time bitcoin was valued at nearly $20,000 a coin was in December 2017, at the height of the currency’s last bull run.

“Three years on, the crypto industry has consolidated, matured and is seeing real traction with institutional investors. Investors are using bitcoin as an inflationary hedge to combat the prospect of continued government stimulus,” Peters said.

“Will it be a merry Christmas for bitcoin holders? We’ll have to wait and see, but the signs look promising.”",2020-11-17 00:00:00,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/palling-up-to-crypto-could-paypals-bitcoin-accommodation-lead-to-widespread-adoption,"The introduction of bitcoin purchases to PayPal’s 346 million global users is the biggest step toward mainstream crypto adoption ever.

The introduction of bitcoin purchases to PayPal’s 346 million global users is the biggest step toward mainstream crypto adoption ever.

The autumn of 2020 has been a lucrative one for bitcoin investors, with the world’s most famous cryptocurrency being awoken from a bearish end to the summer with the news that payments giant PayPal was set to begin accommodating BTC payments within its 346 million global user base.

With the news of PayPal’s accommodation of Bitcoin emerging on October 21, we can see a significant rise in the value of the cryptocurrency leading to BTC almost reaching highs of $14,000 before a correction took place.

However, the long-term impact of PayPal accepting the buying, selling, holding and spending of bitcoin within their accounts could lead to huge levels of adoption of the currency. Could we be on the verge of an era of unprecedented growth for both Bitcoin and the world of crypto as a whole?

A “Pivotal Moment” In Bitcoin’s History

The arrival of PayPal accommodating Bitcoin represents the biggest single step that any cryptocurrency has made toward mainstream adoption in over 10 years of existence.

In the past, cryptocurrencies have been met with scepticism from would-be adopters due to its links to the black market and shady dealings, but the arrival of a major player in finance will not only supply its users with the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin (though, critically, not directly on the Bitcoin network) but can also go a long way in establishing a new level of confidence in consumers who were fearful of investing before.

Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, told Decrypt that PayPal’s announcement regarding its accommodation of bitcoin “could very much be the moment that is considered pivotal when the Bitcoin history books are written.”

""In my view, this is an extremely significant move for cryptocurrency adoption that is likely to expand Bitcoin's reach at a vastly accelerated level, drive the development of additional services and serve as a rock-solid endorsement of the concept of cryptocurrency leading to further institutional involvement,” Deane explained.

Entering A Market Of 346 Million Users

One vitally significant aspect of PayPal’s move to accommodate bitcoin is the fact that it, along with other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin, can now be used to shop with the firm’s 26 million merchants across the world from 2021 onward.

With over 346 million users, PayPal has provided a brand-new layer of practicality for cryptocurrencies that can help its users not only invest in bitcoin but also spend it as if it were a fiat currency within its network.

Furthermore, PayPal appears to understand its role in propelling cryptocurrencies into the financial mainstream, and the company’s President and CEO Dan Schulman has spoken of the challenges that the payment giant expects to face in opening bitcoin up to wider audiences.

""Our global reach, digital payments expertise, two-sided network and rigorous security and compliance controls provide us with the opportunity, and the responsibility, to help facilitate the understanding, redemption and interoperability of these new instruments of exchange,” Shulman explained, per Finextra. “We are eager to work with central banks and regulators around the world to offer our support, and to meaningfully contribute to shaping the role that digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.”

With the price of bitcoin hovering above the $16,000 mark at the time of writing, mass adoption could see the value of investments in the currency rise exponentially — making the coin an attractive proposition for those looking to find an asset that can appreciate faster than traditional stocks and shares.

But what about the notion of adopting Bitcoin with the intention of spending on grocery shopping with PayPal? The scalability of coins with older blockchain frameworks like Bitcoin could be troublesome for any meaningfully practical applications. Currently, Bitcoin is able to process up to seven transactions per second — a far cry from Visa’s 24,000 transactions per second.

While this could be a problem in terms of practical usage, some altcoin networks like Ripple have the ability to handle as many as 1,500 transactions per second. And second layer applications for Bitcoin like the Lightning Network are actively iterating toward faster and more efficient BTC transactions.

Risks To Bitcoin Adoption

One of the most significant issues in PayPal’s adoption of cryptocurrencies stems from the fact that the platform is offering a “custodial service” to users. This means that, despite having the power to buy and sell bitcoin, users won’t actually be able to hold their assets or transfer them to other wallets. Cryptocurrency commentator and the leader of Lightning development firm Zap Jack Mallers explained on Twitter that this move effectively renders PayPal bitcoin as “more or less a separate asset confined to the PayPal network.”

Also, there may also still be uncertainty as to whether the cryptocurrency can overcome the threat of new rivals entering the market.

Many of the world’s biggest economies are looking to make their way into developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), with powerhouses like China already leading the way with its own digital yuan. However, both the U.S. and EU have also been exploring the prospect of transitioning into CBDCs also.

Last month, European Central Bank President Christine Lagard commented that a digital euro currency should be issued to trade alongside the fiat version, with the traditional Euro ultimately being phased out soon after.

As more of the world’s largest central banks and large corporations transition towards digital currencies, it seems inevitable that Bitcoin will soon have to face the threats of new competitors backed by global governments. Global central banks will likely make moves in order to continue their control over the issuance of money supply, and future governmental regulations to clamp down on decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could hinder the progress made by PayPal’s foray into crypto.

Bitcoin’s move into the financial mainstream was never going to be an easy one, and there’s bound to be great hurdles to overcome in the future. But for now, the world of crypto should rejoice at the arrival of PayPal, and the biggest leap yet towards a new frontier of mass adoption.

As confirmed by Binance:

“Much of this record growth [of the cryptocurrency market] is due to the climb in Bitcoin (BTC) price from as low as $11,200 in mid-0ctober to as high as $16,000+, … rising to a 35-month high of $16,400 in mid-November.”

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at nearly $16,700 at the time of writing.

Binance further noted that Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest crypto in terms of market cap and adoption, also exhibited a “bullish” trend this month, “with lows in the $370 range and highs at around $470 toward mid-November.” During this same time period, Binance Coin (BNB), which is one of the most successful altcoin projects, was on “a slight downturn, from a high of almost $32 by the end of October to $26 by the start of November, before stabilizing at around $27.50 mid-November.”

The Binance team noted that Month 40 (since the exchange was launched) was about showing how they leverage blockchain or distributed ledger tech (DLT) to help traders and investors benefit from crypto while also “increasing the safety of everyone’s funds and data.”

Binance confirmed that it recently launched BTokens on Ethereum.

Binance wrote in a blog post:

“To further support the growth of (decentralized finance) DeFi and help bridge it with (centralized finance) CeFi, we launched wrapped tokens on Ethereum as part of our upgrade to the Token Canal program. We support deposits and withdrawals of these token formats on Binance and the token reserve for these wrapped tokens.”

The global crypto exchange also noted that it has launched BNB Vault, which is a feature on Binance Earn that aims to combine the income benefits of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Launchpool, Savings, DeFi Staking, and several other initiatives through a single interface. Binace notes that traders can now access all “the benefits from every opportunity available for earning more BNB in just one click.”

Binance also mentioned that its Security team had helped recover 99.9% of around $345,000 worth of funds that had been stolen due to an exit scam.

As previously reported, Binance also awarded a $200,000 bounty to the investigators who assisted the exchange with identifying phishing attackers.

The Binance team confirmed:

“As a result of our work with them, the U.S. Department of Justice recently indicted two people responsible for an attempted hack on our exchange in March 2018, while the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control simultaneously announced sanctions targeting the individuals.”

Binance Charity, the “philanthropic” division of Binance, is introducing an Incentive Airdrop Project to address the challenges that “come with recruiting, retaining, and managing volunteers in projects that work for the greater good.”

The Binance team noted that this blockchain-enabled volunteer management system aims to “reward voluntary work, promote volunteering stories, and encourages more people to volunteer for social good.”

The Binance team claims that research has shown that “while over 90% of us want to volunteer, only 1 out of 4 people surveyed in the US actually does.”

“Bears are in disbelief,” the digital-asset market analysis firm Arcane Research wrote early Tuesday in a report, noting that the cryptocurrency is on track to post its sixth straight weekly gain. “It seems like there is nothing stopping bitcoin at the moment.”

Market moves

Look no further than the rapid growth this year in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, and it’s clear why the Ethereum blockchain is dominating so many conversations right now in the digital-asset industry.

The second-largest blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is up 266% this year – twice as much as mooning bitcoin (BTC).

But a lot of savvy digital-asset investors are hedging their bets, buying tokens associated with upstart blockchains that could potentially grab market share from the Ethereum network, often referred to as a “world computer” due to its versatility and programmability.

One such token is dot (DOT), of the Polkadot blockchain, whose co-founder Gavin Wood was a co-founder of Ethereum. Wood wrote the original project white paper for Polkadot in 2016, just a year after the Ethereum network launched.

Since going live in mid-August on exchanges after the Polkadot network performed a 100:1 split, the dot token is up over 44%. Over the same period, Ethereum’s ether has only climbed a bit over 8%.

“The market and investor appetite has been really strong for Polkadot’s dot token,” said Keld van Schreven, managing director of the investment firm KR1, which includes Polkadot in its portfolio. An initial valuation from a pre-network launch fundraising was priced around $3, he said. “So to consistently trade above $4 since then has been really encouraging.”

Bitcoin’s strong rally continues with demand outstripping supply amid the heightened expectations of swift global economic recovery on potential coronavirus vaccines.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to fresh 33-month highs above $17,000 during the early U.S. trading hours. Prices are up 20% this month alone.

Bitcoin has been characterized by some investors as “digital gold” due to a belief the cryptocurrency can serve as an effective hedge against inflation. But in recent weeks, bitcoin prices have gained as gold has struggled, following the news that two drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, had announced promising results in developing coronavirus vaccines.

The possibility that a vaccine might arrive early next year, helping the global economy to return toward pre-pandemic output levels sooner than expected, has triggered a rotation of money out of defensive assets and into risk assets, according to Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Bitcoin, however, has stayed bid on strong holding sentiment and the supply shortage. “Since bitcoin was at $11,400 a month ago, miners have been selling an average of 11 bitcoins per hour on exchanges. In comparison, 214 coins per hour have been scooped off exchanges,” Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and the author of The Bitcoin Forecast newsletter, tweeted early Tuesday.

With the global stockpile of negative yielding bonds at record highs and the U.S. dollar expected to depreciate on coronavirus vaccine optimism and continued money printing by the Federal Reserve, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rally to record highs above $20,000.

Tweet of the day",2020-11-17 14:12:45+00:00,https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/south-koreas-new-crypto-aml-law-bans-trading-of-privacy-coins-monero-zcash/,"The “privacy coins” that add an extra layer of anonymity to crypto transactions are no longer welcome in South Korea. Coin brands such as Monero, ZCash and Dash will soon be unavailable at the country’s exchanges, with the government citing crypto anti-money laundering (crypto AML) measures as the reason for the ban.

The controversy surrounding privacy coins

The so-called privacy coins were designed to shore up the last remaining transparent public windows into cryptocurrency transactions. Most mainstream crypto coins, such as Bitcoin, are not completely anonymous: at the very least they make public the wallet addresses involved in the transaction as well as the amount. Law enforcement can track these transactions back to crypto exchanges, where the wallet holders can potentially be identified either by the email address they used to register the exchange account or by using personal identification to open it. The privacy coins add a third party process that hides these transaction records, effectively making the parties involved totally anonymous and also making it extremely difficult for law enforcement to track them down.

While privacy coins are not exclusively used for criminal purposes, criminals are most certainly enthusiastic consumers of them. The South Korean Regulator Financial Services Commission (FSC) cites the frequent use of privacy coins (which it refers to as “dark coins”) for ransomware attacks and money laundering as a central reason for the ban, claiming that these transactions are too hard to trace.

Privacy coins with the added protections such as Dash, Monero and Zcash will no longer be offered by the country’s crypto exchanges as of the beginning of March 2021. The new law is an addition to the existing Special Payments Act, a comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation act that was passed in early March of this year. In addition to crypto AML, the new terms require exchanges to implement a variety of “know your customer” (KYC) measures that ensure account holders are identified by some sort of government-issued document. Once the terms go into effect, the exchanges will have six months to report the changes they have made to achieve compliance.

Though the crypto AML terms will not be in effect for over three months, some South Korean exchanges dropped certain types of privacy coins voluntarily as much as a year ago. The biggest example of this was crypto giant OKEX, which dropped five types of privacy coins (including Monero and Zcash) in September of 2019 over concerns that dealing in them could violate the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s “travel rule.” The travel rule was written to apply to more standard transfers between international banks and specifies personal information that must be collected in these circumstances; some of the crypto exchanges feared that the regulation would also be applied to them. None of the largest exchanges in the country currently offer privacy coins, but a number of smaller cryptocurrency exchanges still deal in them.

The FSC was unambiguous in its new approach to ransomware investigation and crypto AML rules, stating that it wants to eliminate “all forms” of anonymity in the use of coins within the country. Though there has been something of a mania for cryptocurrency in South Korea since 2017, with the city of Seoul’s government even proposing that it would develop its own type of coin, public sentiment began to turn to some degree in 2019 due to the “Nth Room” case. The Nth Room was an underground club that was creating violent sexual content and child pornography, accepting payments in privacy coins to allow access via Telegram. A petition to the government to publicly reveal the identities of Nth Room users collected five million signatures.

Crypto AML laws around the world

The past year or two has brought a flurry of regulation of cryptocurrencies around the world, with most countries following this same pattern in citing crypto AML measures and the potential for funding cybercrime as the central reasons.

A number of other countries, such as Australia and Canada, have either opted to regulate cryptocurrency under existing money laundering and terrorism financing laws or have expanded crypto AML terms to cover exchanges. In terms of bans, there are several that have simply outlawed use of all types of cryptocurrency: Algeria, Bolivia, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam. India had banned it, but lifted the ban in early 2020. Some, most notably China and Thailand, simply bar financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions rather than passing punitive measures that could affect individuals.

The specific banning of privacy coins is a much more rare measure; South Korea is only the second nation (after Japan) to place government restrictions on Monero and similar currencies. However, major exchanges in Australia and the United States have already voluntarily opted to drop Monero and similar cryptocoins.",2020-11-17 16:00:00+00:00,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/11/18414374/bitcoin-surpasses-17-5k-level-is-momentum-on-the-cryptos-side,"Bitcoin is gaining momentum and traded above the $17,500 mark on Tuesday. The last time the cryptocurrency touched its all-time high of $20,000 was back in December 2017.

Further Momentum? Many believe it's possible the digital asset hitting could hit a new high and overcome the psychological barrier of $20,000.

“Bitcoin has spent 0.32% of its life at $16,000 and above, which means there were relatively very few buyers at that level back in 2017,"" says George McDonaugh, managing director of publicly listed cryptocurrency firm KR1.

""Also the space was smaller in terms of participants. This correlates to there being very few sellers at this level now, meaning there isn’t a strong resistance band for the bulls to push the price higher.""

There have been a number of factors that have pushed Bitcoin higher, such as the narrative from central banks around the adoption of digital currencies and major investment institutions diversifying into Bitcoin is driving the current interest and bull market, a narrative McDonaugh expects to continue in the future.

No Slowing Down: “Bitcoin passed $17,500 on Tuesday and is less than 15% from its ATH with no sign of slowing down,” says Lolli CEO Alex Adelman.

“This bull run is different than 2017. We’re seeing progress from major players like CitiGroup, J.P. Morgan, Paypal, and Druckenmiller — they’re all betting big bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation, uncertainty, and the turmoils of 2020. Increased institutional adoption is growing bitcoin’s price, fueling further adoption,” adds Adelman.

Bitcoin Is Erratic: “Be warned though,"" says McDonaugh, ""as we’ve seen so many times in the past, Bitcoin can surprise and if going by the cycle trading were due a pull-back soon. I expect we don’t reach $20,000 in this current move and consolidate before going again and breaking through in early 2021. That’s how bitcoin has liked to behave in the past.”

(Bloomberg) -- In an era of prosperity for investment banks, Credit Suisse Group AG is careening from one crisis to another and then another -- this time, with a $4.7 billion writedown tied to billionaire investor Bill Hwang’s trading blowout.The staggering hit -- the largest yet linked to market-shaking losses run up by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management -- prompted sweeping management changes at the Swiss bank Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on its checkered record of managing risks. It caps a catalog of costly errors at Credit Suisse -- most recently the collapse of Greensill Capital -- in what was supposed to be the start of steadier era under Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein.At a moment when investment banks are feasting on market activity and dealmaking, Credit Suisse is under mounting pressure to persuade shareholders and clients it can put its house in order and remain a vital, independent force in global banking. After the firm announced plans to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their recommendation for the stock, which already was breaking with peers in tumbling this year.“The ongoing negative newsflow could have an impact on the remainder” of Credit Suisse’s businesses, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan wrote in a note, lowering their rating to neutral from overweight. “Besides the impact from various management changes and regulatory oversight,” they wrote, the bank “might have to pursue a strategy of ‘capital preservation’” that could restrain growth.David Herro at Harris Associates, a top shareholder of Credit Suisse, said the bank’s losses should serve as a “wakeup call” to expedite cultural change as Chairman Urs Rohner prepares to hand over to Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio at the end of the month.

Bitcoin Price Latest News: Virtual currency Bitcoin surged more than 10 per cent to $18,450 on Wednesday, extending a bull run that began last month after US-based online payments company PayPal allowed its customers to use the cryptocurrency on its network. Bitcoin was last seen quoting at $17,979.0, up $1233.9 - or 7.37 per cent - compared to its previous close of $16,745.1. Though highly volatile and still not recorgnised as legal by many central banks, Bitcoin has caught the attention of many investors for its exponential returns - having touched the $1,000 mark for the first time in 2013.

On Wednesday, Bitcoin swung in a more than $1,800 range of $16,633-18,450, a day after surging to its highest since December 2017, as the cryptocurrency's perceived quality as a hedge against inflation and expectations of mainstream acceptance lured institutional and retail demand.

Bitcoin's 2020 rally has drawn momentum from strong appetite for riskier assets following unprecedented government and central bank stimulus measures to combat impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its reputation for being inflation-proof.

Bitcoin is up 150 per cent against the US dollar so far this year, having bounced back 360 per cent from its March lows due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Major central banks around the globe are exploring whether to allow the issuance of digital currencies.

A bitcoin, similar to any other real world currency, is the equivalent of cash, but in electronic form. In other words, you can't hold a bitcoin in your hand, unlike currencies such as dollars or rupees.

Like a banknote or coin, it gives its holder a direct claim on the central bank, bypassing commercial banks and offering a greater level of security as a central bank can never run out of the currency it issues.

While many analysts are viewing Bitcoin as a possible inflation hedge, others are still skeptical about its acceptance as a substitute to real currency.

Other major cryptocurrencies - from the likes of ethereum and XRP - have also risen taking cues from the appreciation in Bitcoin.",,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-exploding-still-losing-smaller-073625680.html,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- In an era of prosperity for investment banks, Credit Suisse Group AG is careening from one crisis to another and then another -- this time, with a $4.7 billion writedown tied to billionaire investor Bill Hwang’s trading blowout.The staggering hit -- the largest yet linked to market-shaking losses run up by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management -- prompted sweeping management changes at the Swiss bank Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on its checkered record of managing risks. It caps a catalog of costly errors at Credit Suisse -- most recently the collapse of Greensill Capital -- in what was supposed to be the start of steadier era under Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein.At a moment when investment banks are feasting on market activity and dealmaking, Credit Suisse is under mounting pressure to persuade shareholders and clients it can put its house in order and remain a vital, independent force in global banking. After the firm announced plans to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their recommendation for the stock, which already was breaking with peers in tumbling this year.“The ongoing negative newsflow could have an impact on the remainder” of Credit Suisse’s businesses, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan wrote in a note, lowering their rating to neutral from overweight. “Besides the impact from various management changes and regulatory oversight,” they wrote, the bank “might have to pursue a strategy of ‘capital preservation’” that could restrain growth.David Herro at Harris Associates, a top shareholder of Credit Suisse, said the bank’s losses should serve as a “wakeup call” to expedite cultural change as Chairman Urs Rohner prepares to hand over to Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio at the end of the month. Rohner has offered to forgo his compensation for 2020 of 1.5 million francs.Another long-standing backer of the bank, Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, stands to suffer a personal hit as well after vehicles linked to him invested about $200 million in funds Credit Suisse ran with Greensill, according to people familiar with the matter.

If you’re not sure what a debate between “hodlers” and “weak hands” means, or have forgotten, here’s a guide or refresher:

FOMO

Story continues below advertisement

The fear of missing out is a powerful force in all markets, but is especially potent in a field where there’s no such thing as fundamental value. Crypto fans often cite FOMO as one of the reasons investors might buy cryptocurrencies when they’re in the midst of a rally.

FUD

Fear, uncertainty and doubt. Another term used in other investing contexts, it was adopted by the crypto community to denounce what supporters see as the intentional spread of misinformation. Skeptics see it used as a way to brush off anything negative.

Halving

This is sometimes referred to as halvening -- a planned reduction in rewards miners receive (the term is mentioned in Bitcoin’s code). Halvings happen once every four years or so -- more precisely, every 210,000 blocks of transactions. As the name suggests, each one cuts the amount of Bitcoin miners receive per block reward in half. The practice serves to maintain scarcity. This year, Bitcoin’s halving was followed by a steady rise in its price over the subsequent weeks.

Hodl

“Hold” as misspelled by a frenzied Bitcoin trader on an online forum in 2013. It’s become the mantra of cryptocurrency believers during market routs, meant to reassure nervous traders that they should ride out any given slump because of what they see is Bitcoin’s long-run advantages. Anyone willing to stomach the volatility is thought to be hodling.

Weak hands

This phrase is used to describe cryptocurrency newbies who, instead of hodling, nervously panic-sell their coins in response to market jitters or negative headlines that wouldn’t faze experienced traders. Some weak hands bail out of Bitcoin in favor of so-called alt coins, cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. There are more than 7,000 digital tokens, according to Coinmarketcap.com. Many tend to take their cues from Bitcoin, oftentimes rising or falling in tandem.

Whale

In a wide range of markets, whales are investors whose holdings are so large that their every trade makes waves. It’s a term that comes with a suspicion of market manipulation. So, too with Bitcoin whales, or people who hold a lot of Bitcoin. Some estimates show just a handful control a large percentage of the market, so they have the power to move prices. About 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control 95% of the digital asset, according to researcher Flipside Crypto.

Key Takeaways The central bank is applying a 1977 sanctions regulation to crypto exchanges to discourage money laundering and terrorist financing.

The Bitonic exchange is the first to report changes, with users now forced to prove they control their BTC wallets.

The exchange has pointed out that no other EU country has these requirements on crypto.

Share this article

Bitonic released a blog post on Monday stating that the exchange was, under protest, adding extra verification for Bitcoin addresses.

The exchange must now ask users to disclose “the purpose with which you intend to purchase bitcoins and what kind of wallet you use.” Users must also prove that they control their wallets with screenshots or signed messages.

As imposed by the Dutch central bank (@DNB_NL), Bitcoin exchanges in The Netherlands must now ask their customers to ""prove"" they really control their withdrawal address. No other European country requires this. Via @Bitonic: https://t.co/UEtVJD3e5z. pic.twitter.com/Nbsa9usSWF — Aaron van Wirdum (@AaronvanW) November 17, 2020

Bitonic firmly disagrees with the measure, stating, “We have repeatedly pleaded DNB to drop this requirement as we find this measure to be ineffective and disproportionate.”

Asked why the Netherlands has stricter regulations than other EU nations, Bitonic told Crypto Briefing:

“We seriously don’t know. We can make assumptions, the Netherlands has a conservative view on this industry and a world view based on fear in general.”

1977 Sanctions Act to Regulate Bitcoin

The central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, is using the Sanctions Act written in the 1970s to crack down on crypto exchanges. The act aims to determine that funds are not being sent to anyone on a Dutch or EU sanctions list as part of AML and anti-terror financing measures.

Bitonic has appealed to users to formally object to the central bank about the harsh measures, which are not in place in any other EU country.

The Netherlands appears to have a heavy-handed approach to Bitcoin regulation, with Dutch Bitcoin companies facing millions in excessive fees earlier this year.

The fees were due to the Ministry of Finance requiring the central bank to monitor activity in the national crypto industry.

The high costs have made it difficult for Dutch Bitcoin companies to do business, and again, the measures were disproportionate to those implemented in other EU countries.

Market moves

Bitcoin’s breathtaking rally for the past couple of months has been attributed to all sorts of grand macroeconomic reasons, from the need for a safe haven as the pandemic ravages the global economy once more to marvelous projections about the future role of the cryptocurrency in finance.

Yet, what if the recent run-up was merely the result of miners in China having a hard time finding a place to sell their inventory for the kind of hard cash they need to pay the bills? In other words, fewer new bitcoin may be hitting the market and that’s what’s driving prices higher. That’s an explanation explored in Omkar Godbole’s article on CoinDesk Wednesday.

According to recent note from QCP Capital on its Telegram channel, miners in China are seeing their bank accounts and credit cards frozen as the government tries to crack down on money laundering. That’s a big deal for bitcoin because 70% of its mining power comes from China.

In the process, the government’s squeeze is also affecting a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges catering to Chinese customers, most notably OKEx and Huobi; some questions have been raised about what happened to a couple of executives at such firms, as CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported last week. OKEx suspended withdrawals on Oct. 16 when founder Mingxing “Star” Xu was rumored to have been taken into police custody. It announced Thursday that it “will be resuming withdrawals” on or before Nov. 27 as Xu is now said to be a free man again.

Over the summer, OTC traders in China also felt the heat, and they had a hard time getting access to cash as well.

For all the talk about how bitcoin is the future staring us right in the face with no social distancing or mask, utilities companies, landlords and maintenance employees still need to be paid in fiat. Their bills aren’t denominated in satoshis but in yuan. Thus, there’s always a need for miners to trade into local currency and get on with whatever they do in their lives because many public service providers in China don’t exactly accept tether. According to QCP Capital, a survey done by Colin Wu showed that 74% of miners claim they have trouble selling their inventory to cover operating expenses.

To be sure, Wu’s survey may not have been conducted with the most rigid of standards. And the calendar still insists that this year is 2020. If there’s one thing this year has taught the world it’s that surveys should be taken with a great of salt. Nonetheless, it’s a data point.

Bitcoin’s gains since the start of October have been nothing short of phenomenal. Its price is up about 65% since the start of last month. Over the past few weeks, some of China’s biggest exchanges started seeing accounts frozen and executives all of a sudden, er, out of the office at the moment.

Coincidence? Maybe.

Meanwhile, volume on bitcoin has been healthy, with $1.6 billion traded Wednesday on some of the major exchanges, as CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey reported. Open interest in bitcoin options have shot up to a record high of over $4 billion, double what it was in mid-October. What’s more, positions in the options market are as bullish as they have ever been.

About 900 bitcoin are mined every day. At current prices, that’s worth just $16 million. However, in a month it adds up to nearly $500 million, and the lion’s share of that is from China.

This is an interesting case where the supply curve may be shifting inward just as the demand curve is shifting outward. Either one of those would, all things being equal, raise prices. And while we may now be witnessing both, it’s good to remember that a sudden return to the previous condition for either one of those curves could drop prices as fast as it raised them.

Bitcoin's recovering ""put-call skew"" could show investors hedging against potential price pullback. Source: Skew

Bitcoin is taking a breather, having chalked out a steep rally to three-year highs above $18,000 in the past six weeks.

At press time, bitcoin is trading near $17,700, having faced rejection above $18,000 multiple times in the past 24 hours. Some investors are beginning to position for a deeper pullback with the cryptocurrency struggling to establish a foothold above $18,000.

The one-month implied volatility, which is mainly determined by the demand for call and put options, jumped from roughly 55% to a four-month high of 70.5% in the past two days, suggesting increased expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks.

Alongside that, the spread between the cost of puts, or bearish bets, and calls eased, as evidenced by the recovery in the one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews. Notably, the one-month gauge bounced from -27% to 14%, according to data source Skew.

The numbers indicate increased demand for put options – a sign of investors hedging against a potential price pullback.

Ether moving out of DeFi

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $475 and climbing 0.55% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The amount of ether “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is declining. The fall began Nov. 14, going from 8.9 million to 7.7 million ETH as of press time, according to aggregator DeFi Pulse.

Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for investment firm Tellurian Capital, suspects some of the ether movement out of DeFi might have to do with Ethereum’s ambitious “2.0” project. This requires some capital allocation to a smart contract set aside for staking something known as the “beacon chain” to launch the new network.

“There is the need to find another 400,000 ETH to fill the first phase of staking into ETH 2.0 by the end of November,” said Bonnefous. “So this might explain some of the leakage out of DeFi.”

CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group , which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups",2020-11-19 14:29:51+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-crypto-currencies-graphic-idUKKBN27Z2IG,"LONDON (Reuters) - Is it an inflation hedge? A currency? Or just another niche asset to take a punt on? Bitcoin is in the headlines, re-kindling a debate over its true role and the drivers behind its latest scintillating rally.

Bitcoin, with a history of vertiginous ascents and steep drops, is close to taking out its record peak of near $20,000, having climbed almost 160% this year. Its gains in November alone are more than 30%.

Here’s the story of bitcoin’s 2020 rise in four charts:

RISK-ON TRADE

As central banks and governments unleashed the money-printing presses and spending taps to combat the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, plentiful liquidity has lifted assets from emerging currencies and junk bonds to bitcoin and stocks.

Assets under management (AUM) at Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, have soared to a record $10.4 billion, up more than 75% from September. Its bitcoin fund is up 85%.

Smaller rival CoinShares says its AUM has climbed more than 150% this year to $1.3 billion.

More broadly, high savings rates have sent money flooding into investment funds, potentially sparking interest in bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier.

JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says there are signs of family offices, which manage money for wealthy people, allocating towards the cryptocurrency.

INFLATION HEDGE?

With governments and central banks in full stimulus mode, some observers reckon bitcoin is a useful safeguard against inflation - with supply capped at 21 million, its scarcity gives it an innate value.

Some who buy gold to hedge inflation risk may be turning to crypto, JPM’s Panigirtozoglou said, adding: “There is a reassessment of bitcoin about its value here as an alternative currency, as an alternative to gold.”

But bitcoin’s rise outstrips gold’s gains of 20% or so, while an inflation-linked government bonds index is up 4%.

And its rally has sped up in recent weeks even as gold has flatlined, and the resurgent pandemic makes a growth and inflation recovery a distant prospect.

LOW(ER) VOLATILITY

Part of the gains may be due to growing acceptance of bitcoin as a payments system and by a broader range of investors.

Bitcoin has jumped by half since PayPal PYPL.O said last month it would open its network to cryptocurrencies, meaning users could spend bitcoin at its 26 million merchants.. That fanned hopes it could catch on as a way to pay.

Traders who say there is more participation by bigger investors point to lower levels of volatility than during the 2017 bubble. Ten-day price swings against the dollar between end-June and mid-November - a period when bitcoin prices nearly doubled - were well under historical averages.

“It’s still largely retail, but it’s becoming more efficient, mature, and I see more professional participants,” said Andrea Leccese of crypto fund Bluesky Capital.

Bitcoin has surged nearly 150% in 2020 and rose above the $18,000 threshold on Wednesday for the first time in three years.

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya said in 2017 that the coin could reach $1 million in the next 20 years, while Michael Novogratz sees the coin surging to $60,000 in the next twelve months.

Meanwhile, so-called Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach said ""I don't believe in bitcoin. I think it's a lie.""

Detailed below is what seven investing titans think about bitcoin as it soars to new heights.

Watch Bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin rose above $18,000 on Wednesday to its highest level in three years as institutions and investors around the world continued to pile into the cryptocurrency. While some investing legends like Chamath Palihapitiya have been outspoken bulls since the coin's inception, others have raised their doubts.

Detailed below is what seven investing titans have said about bitcoin in the past:

Chamath Palihapitiya

Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC in February that ""everyone"" should have 1% of their assets in Bitcoin because it's a ""fantastic hedge.""



""It would be great that an average individual citizen of any country of the world has an uncorrelated hedge... Every financial instrument is correlated, except Bitcoin, the Social Capital CEO said.



Palihapitiya frequently tweets ""HODL,"" a slang term within the cryptocurrency community that refers to holding the coin rather than selling. For example, on Sept. 22 he tweeted, ""I've made some great bets before but nothing compares to my bitcoin bet in 2012...PS, HODL.""

In 2017, he told CNBC bitcoin will be worth one million dollars by 2037.

Stanley Druckenmiller

""I'm a bit of a dinosaur, but I have warmed up to the fact that bitcoin could be an asset class that has a lot of attraction as a store of value,"" Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Nov 9. The head of Duquesne Family Office expects inflation to rise in the next five years and said owning bitcoin will be a good hedge against inflationary pressure. The billionaire investor added that he owns a ""tiny bit"" of the coin.

Ray Dalio

The founder of the world's largest hedge fund tweeted on Tuesday he ""might be missing something about bitcoin"" and sees a number of reasons why the coin can't serve as a reliable currency.

Dalio said bitcoin isn't a ""very good as a store-hold of wealth"" because its volatility is so high. He added that he doubts central banks, institutional investors, businesses, or multinational corporations would ever buy large amounts of bitcoin to hold as a reserve asset. However the Bridgewater Associates founder admitted to his twitter followers he's open to being corrected if he's ""wrong about these things.""

Bill Miller

""It's been very volatile, but I think right now its staying power gets better every day. I think the risks of bitcoin going to zero are much much lower than they've ever been before,"" said the founder of Miller Value Partners in a CNBC interview on Nov. 6.



The investing legend also pointed out that Bitcoin has been the ""single best performing asset class"" in the last year, five-year, and 10-year periods.

Paul Tudor Jones

Hedge-fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones called bitcoin ""the best inflation trade"" in a CNBC interview from Oct 22.

""Bitcoin has this enormous contingence of really, really smart and sophisticated people who believe in it,"" Jones said. ""It's like investing with Steve Jobs and Apple and investing in Google early.""

Jeffrey Gundlach

In a RealVision interview from Oct 1, billionaire ""Bond King"" Jeffrey Gundlach voiced his doubts about bitcoin. ""I don't believe in bitcoin. I think that it's a lie. I think that it's very tracked, traceable. I don't think it's anonymous."" Gundlach later added that he was ""not at all a bitcoin hater.""

Mike Novogratz

Outspoken bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz told CNBC on Wednesday bitcoin has ""hit escape velocity"" and could surge to $60,000 by the end of 2021 as more institutional investors adopt the cryptocurrency.

""People are going to bitcoin because there's 20 million bitcoins that will ever be mined, there's complete scarcity in it. People believe it's a store of value. It's a social construct, and you can't change that,"" said Novogratz.

On Monday he tweeted, ""A lot of friends asking me if they missed the crypto rally. [For whoever is wondering], I bought more $BTC and $ETH last night. #bullish.""

Thailand has reportedly revised its net capital rules which help securities firms launch cryptocurrency exchanges. The country now has 15 licensed crypto service providers.

New Thai Rules and Crypto Exchanges

The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revised its net capital (NC) rules which help securities companies provide crypto services, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.

“The revised NC rules are expected to help free up liquidity for securities firms that plan to enter new business such as open digital or cryptocurrency exchanges,” the publication conveyed, adding that some securities companies have consulted with the SEC to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.

Securities companies operating crypto businesses will be allowed to calculate the net capital funds with the value of these cryptocurrencies. “The maximum amount calculable for digital assets to a firm’s NC is 50% of the asset value,” the publication noted. The new rules will also count crypto assets as capital funds.

For securities companies that operate crypto businesses and stores crypto assets for their customers, the rules require them “to maintain more than 1% of the cold wallet’s capital funds (offline system) and 5% of the client’s assets stored on another system (hot wallet or online system).” For crypto companies that do not provide crypto custody service, “the NC requires shareholders’ equity to be over 500,000 baht [$16,469].”

15 Crypto Firms Approved

The Thai Royal Decree on the Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 regulates the cryptocurrency sector in Thailand. It categorizes crypto businesses into three types: “digital asset exchange,” “digital asset broker,” and “digital asset dealer.” There is also a separate category for initial coin offering (ICO) portals.

A total of 15 cryptocurrency service providers have been licensed to legally operate in the country, according to the Thai SEC’s website. Some companies have received more than one license.

Eight companies are licensed to operate digital asset exchanges: Bitkub, BX, Satang Pro, Huobi, ERX, Zipmex, Upbit, and Z.com Ex. Five companies are licensed to act as digital asset brokers: Coins TH, Bitazza, Kulap, Upbit, and Z.com Ex. Four companies are approved to operate ICO portals: Longroot, T-box, SE Digital, and Bitherb.

Masayoshi Son, a billionaire technology entrepreneur and CEO of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, claimed that he “doesn't understand” Bitcoin amid the cryptocurrency breaking its three-year highs.

Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, Son said that he found Bitcoin investment to be “distracting his own focus on his own business,” Business Insider reported on Nov. 19.

Son said that he would spend about five minutes each day watching Bitcoin prices fluctuate. Son noted that he was told by a friend to invest “1% of his personal assets” into Bitcoin, meaning he invested “about $200 million.”

The billionaire admitted that the recurring distraction triggered him to sell all his Bitcoin stake, causing losses of around $50 million. “I feel so much better,” Son said.

Son stated that digital currencies are a useful development and that they won’t go away anytime soon, but he will focus on other projects. He said:

“I think digital currency will be useful [...] But I don’t know what digital currency, what structure, and so on.”

Son reportedly bought Bitcoin when it was near its historic high of $20,000 in December 2017. As previously reported, Son allegedly lost millions by selling the cryptocurrency in early 2018 when the Bitcoin price subsequently started plummeting.

Son’s latest remarks come amid a major bullish trend in crypto markets, with Bitcoin inching closer to $20,000.

Some analysts see $19,000 as certainly within reach, but bitcoin won’t shoot straight up getting there, noted John Kramer, a trader at crypto firm GSR. “It feels more and more like we’re hitting a bitcoin tipping point,” Kramer told CoinDesk. “That’s not to say that the price will rocket past $19,000; in fact, a cooldown is to be expected.”

“I expect a lot more media coverage and reinforcement of the narrative around bitcoin being a better alternative to gold in the near future as more and more prominent Wall Street investors like BlackRock are openly sharing their positive views,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.

Lau was referring to an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” by Rick Rieder, fixed income CIO at BlackRock, the $7 trillion assert manager. “Do I think it’s a durable mechanism that … could take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,” Rieder said of bitcoin during the program.

In the derivatives market, options traders are betting on some bitcoin uncertainty for December expiration. Traders expect a 54% chance of bitcoin staying over $18,000, a 44% chance of $19,000 per 1 BTC and a 35% chance of $20,000.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant, said many are dismissing the impact ether could have on the derivatives market heading into 2021.

“If one goes by the notion that bitcoin will become a more commonly held asset in traditional space, then there is little that would prevent [ether] in following suit,” Vinokourov told CoinDesk. “Expect the CME to launch ether futures and options in due course, as the current market positioning and flow clearly show growing demand.”

TVL in DeFi going up, but not from BTC, ETH

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $510 and climbing 7.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The total amount of cryptocurrency “locked” (TVL) in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has passed $14 billion for the first time, at $14.1 billion as of press time.

However, the amount of ETH locked has been declining, perhaps because some stakers are moving the asset over to Ethereum 2.0 contract.

In addition, the amount of bitcoin locked is also dipping in DeFi.

It seems that smaller tokens are seeing major gains along with BTC and ETH, likely contributing to TVL gains, although as of press time DeFi Pulse did not respond to a request for comment on how it accounts for those tokens in its metrics.

“The substantial recent price run-up in ETH and BTC have caused in nominal dollar terms the TVL to balloon as the smaller absolute number of tokens of each is still representing a much larger dollar amount,” noted John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritium.

Every day, in every corner of the Earth, people have a choice of how to spend, whether it is cash, checks, or using Visa, Mastercard or a local card in their market, and new fintech platforms. The post-Covid world does not look great for cash and checks — just look at the stock price of a payments fintech Square this year versus that of a cash security company like Brink's. For Visa CEO Alfred Kelly, there's opportunity in the rapid changes in the way people pay for things. ""The battleground always is out in the local market, every day,"" Kelly said at the recent CNBC Evolve Summit. ""We operate in 230 countries and territories and want to win as many transactions as we can."" The Visa CEO cited an estimated $18 trillion still spent in cash and checks as an opportunity that will ""accelerate with coronavirus and concern about germs."" One of the digital accelerants during Covid-19 is cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the most prominent example, is approaching a record and Visa sees digital currencies playing a greater role in its business in the years ahead.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The price of bitcoin has soared in 2020 in a world beset by a virus that increases fears about exchanging physical currency and has led to massive central bank monetary stimulus.

Underlying Visa's view of cryptocurrencies is an evolving definition of the company as a network. ""We're a network and increasingly trying to become a network of networks,"" Kelly said. It is an idea behind the recent acquisition of Plaid, which has attracted antitrust scrutiny. Plaid sits between 11,000 financial institutions in the U.S. and 2,700 fintech developers, facilitating the movement of data. Visa, meanwhile, facilitates the movement of money. ""Plaid is just at its most simple level another network that we believe fits into a desire to have multiple networks on which we move information and money around the world,"" the Visa CEO said. Mastercard announced it planned to buy Finicity, a Plaid competitor, for roughly $1 billion earlier this year. The idea of combining data and money is also a way to define digital currency. ""Crypto is a developing part of payments in the world,"" Kelly said. ""As a payment rail, the company has to connect to every market and commerce venue available. As digital assets (in all their forms) are more seriously considered by governments to be legitimate and an actual economic instrument, it becomes more strategic for a card network to plug into it,"" said Lex Sokolin, a fintech expert and global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, which focuses on the ethereum digital currency, in an email to CNBC discussing Visa's strategy.

A few years back in 2018, Kelly told CNBC's Jim Cramer that Visa would only move into cryptocurrencies if it evolved beyond use as a store of value. ""If we actually think that crypto starts moving from being more of a commodity to actually really being a payment instrument,"" he said in 2018. While he said this sector is still in its ""nascent stage"" as a payments phenomenon, it seems to be happening, though it will take years to play out in a major way as part of Visa's platform. Visa's interest is not in cryptocurrencies as a commodity markets play, though many market experts see it as a viable alternative to gold, the most famous commodity market store of value. Visa, instead, is targeting digital currencies that ""become fiat-based,"" Kelly said at the CNBC Evolve event, providing a clear understanding of the value. ""A lot of the work in the space over the last two years is coming together to create a new story in the mainstream. ... Companies like PayPal are supporting bitcoin purchases, and Square is using it as a treasury asset. The OCC claims that American banks can custody crypto assets as well,"" Sokolin explained, adding that within the crypto space, one can use decentralized finance to save, pay, trade, invest, and insure, and there are new ways to manufacture financial products.

Visa, Mastercard moving digital currency

Visa, which already works with roughly two dozen cryptocurrencies, said the opportunity is in the exchange of crypto for the purchase of a good or service, and adding the Visa credential to those new systems so the cryptocurrencies can be converted to fiat currency and the funds put in a wallet to be used anywhere Visa is accepted. Visa and its competitor Mastercard have already signed cryptocurrency card deals in recent years. Visa has a partnership with Coinbase. ""Ultimately, we could see digital currencies running on the Visa network on a more regular basis,"" Kelly said, though he added it would be ""a number of years out."" ""We are certainly open to any vehicle that helps facilitate the movement of money around the world. We want to be in the middle of it,"" he added. The Visa CEO said one of the biggest opportunities for cryptocurrencies will be in countries where there are underbanked and unbanked individuals, especially in emerging markets, though also in the U.S.. ""There are 1.7 billion people on the face of the Earth we think are not banked in a mainstream banking system in whatever country they live in, including some here in the U.S.,"" Kelly said.

Cryptocurrencies – particularly the Bitcoin system – have long posed an 'existential risk' to the payment networks. By their design, systems like bitcoin are intended to make centrally-controlled payments systems like Visa and Mastercard obsolete. Lisa Ellis analyst at MoffettNathanson

Visa will also be working with central banks around the world as they increase focus on their own digital currencies. The central banking efforts are still what Kelly described as being in the early stages, with China's work the furthest advanced. ""We continue to expect to work with central banks around the world as they develop digital currencies for the future,"" the Visa CEO said. ""Large global institutions are also moving further along the adoption curve in developing capital market settlement and global trade systems. On top of that, central banks continue to push forward with CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], which would require blockchain systems to flourish,"" Sokolin said, whose ConsenSys has four CBDC-related projects across Thailand, France, Australia, and Hong Kong in the last quarter alone.

Bitcoin moving beyond existential threat

Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson who covers Visa and Mastercard, said the interest from the payments networks right now is more helpful to the crypto space than it is to Visa. ""The sharp move in BTC year-to-date is largely driven by more 'mainstream' payments companies (e.g., PayPal, Visa, Mastercard) getting more openly and actively involved in crypto – essentially giving it their 'blessing' & vote of confidence,"" she wrote in an email to CNBC. One reason she cited was the payments networks' high bars for security, quality of technology, and regulatory compliance. ""Their entire businesses are built on trust – the trust of consumers, of merchants, of banks, government, etc. Visa and Mastercard now openly saying that they are working with governments to help design & implement digital fiat, and saying that they will enable multiple cryptos on their networks, means that these technologies have now matured enough that they pass the networks' credibility litmus tests."" Though she added for Wall Street and investors in companies like Visa, there has been a ""a collective sigh of relief"" to see Visa and Mastercard actively playing a role in shaping the digital currency and cryptocurrency space.

It was last seen trading up 1.13 per cent at $18,206.40.

Other major cryptocurrencies also rose taking cues from Bitcoin. Among peers, Ethereum (ETH) traded 5.90 per cent higher at $505.82, while Tether was up 0.12 per cent, XRP up 4.19 per cent, Chainlink up 2.82 per cent and Litecoin (LTC) up 3.55 per cent.

Bitcoin has extended its current upmove in past few sessions, having risen to a nearly three-year high of $17,868 on Tuesday.

The cryptocurrency's perceived quality as a hedge against inflation and expectations of mainstream acceptance lured institutional and retail demand.

Bitcoin's 2020 rally has drawn momentum from strong appetite for riskier assets following unprecedented government and central bank stimulus measures to combat impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its reputation for being inflation-proof.

At Friday's intraday high, Bitcoin is up 153 per cent against the US dollar so far this year. Though highly volatile and still not recorgnised as legal by many central banks, Bitcoin has caught the attention of many investors for its exponential returns.

Major central banks around the globe are exploring whether to allow the issuance of digital currencies.

A bitcoin, similar to any other real world currency, is the equivalent of cash, but in electronic form.

The platform announced Friday a $3 million funding round from the likes of Pantera Capital, Y Combinator, Tim Draper and others.

“We’re seeing a wave of interest in crypto assets from major banks, fintech companies and portfolio managers,” said Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit. “Globe has built the platform and products that these sophisticated market players need and expect.”

Article content Bitcoin is having a moment, again. The most widely traded cryptocurrency has soared above US$18,000, more than doubling since the end of 2019. Few assets have delivered such strong returns during one of the most turbulent years for financial markets. Bitcoin last scaled these heights in late 2017, during a boom sparked by a frenzy of buying among punters and diehard fans. The market had a “wild west” vibe during that period. The most fertile ground for commentary was often on discussion site Reddit. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Those players are still on the scene. Bitcoin remains exceptionally volatile, and its trading is mostly driven by speculation as opposed to clear fundamentals. Many well-known exchanges suffer too often from technical glitches, withdrawal outages, opaque operating structures and lacklustre government and internal oversight.

Investors would be well served to pay attention, even if they remain on the sidelines. Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund manager, said last month he had a “small” position in Bitcoin, which he described as like “investing with Steve Jobs and Apple or . . . Google early.” “You’ve got this group . . . that is dedicated to seeing Bitcoin succeed in becoming a commonplace store of value and transactional to boot,” he said on CNBC television. “I’ve never had an inflation hedge where you have a kicker that you also have great intellectual capital behind it.” Bitcoin appears to be nibbling away at gold’s place as a ballast in some portfolios, added Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Gold has long been coveted by many investors who consider owning the precious metal a way of protecting against inflation. Panigirtzoglou cited strong flows recently into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust at a time of flows away from ETFs tracking the precious metal as a sign that a nascent shift may be under way. Photo by Leonhard Foeger/Reuters files “This contrast lends support to the idea that some investors such as family offices that previously invested in gold ETFs, may be looking at Bitcoin as an alternative to gold,” he said.

Article content The Grayscale fund, which has almost US$9 billion in assets under management, highlights how it has become easier for money managers to gain exposure to Bitcoin. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, another traditional venue, the number of Bitcoin futures and options contracts open has quadrupled since this time last year to more than 12,000, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data collated by Bloomberg. Panigirtzoglou noted that younger people, millennials in particular, were more likely than their older counterparts to view Bitcoin as an alternative currency to be used for transactions and investment. Adoption is likely to be bolstered further as well-known companies integrate cryptocurrencies into their businesses. PayPal, one of the world’s biggest payments groups, last month began allowing U.S. customers to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other tokens in their online wallets. It plans to enable users to begin using cryptocurrencies as a funding option in transactions with millions of merchants early next year. Transactions will still be settled in traditional currencies, but it represents a step forward in easing the use of cryptocurrencies. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters files Square, which in October bought US$50 million in Bitcoin to show its “potential for continued future growth,” allows users to trade the tokens through its Cash App. These developments represent a marked contrast to several years ago, when storing and using Bitcoin was more complicated and riskier.

Article content Several major central banks, including the European Central Bank, have also started seriously pondering whether to issue digital currencies. They would probably differ meaningfully from the current stable of cryptocurrencies but would provide further, official, backing for the concept. Skeptics abound, of course, and with good reason. Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund Bridgewater, tweeted this week: “I might be missing something about Bitcoin so I’d love to be corrected.” He detailed several worries, including intense volatility, the potential for it to be outlawed and its still limited use in everyday transactions. You could add to this list spotty regulation in many corners, severe issues that pop up frequently at crypto exchanges, and high-profile examples of fraud in the past few years. Some of these problems, such as volatility, are likely to be here to stay, and others will take time to ease. But many are being addressed, and some investors are taking the developments in the sector seriously. For Tudor Jones, at least, “this is the first inning of Bitcoin.” © 2020 The Financial Times Ltd

Bitcoin is not a fad that will fade away, said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investments.

Investors understand that ""buying Bitcoin and putting it in their portfolio is meant to be a store of value, inflation hedge, a digital gold, a digital form of money,"" Sonnenshein told Business Insider.

Investors should not get hung up over the fact that there are only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, because each coin has a 100 million units.

Investors like the fact they can buy a fraction of the coin and add to their position over time, the crypto asset manager pointed out.

Bitcoin is not a fad, and not being able to use it to buy a cup of coffee is not a reasonable argument, according to Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investments, the largest digital currency asset manager.

Growing involvement of major players in the financial services realm ""really speaks to the staying power of the asset class and validates other people getting involved,"" he told Business Insider in an interview.

Sonnenshein, whose firm oversees almost $11 billion crypto assets, said the global pandemic this year was another key driver behind Bitcoin investments. Grayscale saw investors with different motivations and appetites to allocate the digital token to their portfolios this year.

Investors are no longer hanging on to the idea that because we're not using Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee, it has failed as a currency, Sonnenshein said.

""I think they understand today that buying Bitcoin and putting it in their portfolio is meant to be a store of value, inflation hedge, a digital gold, a digital form of money that is much better suited to the digital world we live in today versus historical stores of value like gold which would have been certainly much more applicable to a world characterized by physical exchanges. They view it as one of the most important next steps in the evolution of money and what constitutes a store of value.""

After the pandemic brought money markets to a grinding halt earlier this year, Bitcoin's sustained power and demonstration of resiliency shows that it was one of the best-returning investments, he said.

For skeptics who question the token's validity across conventional financial institutions, he said: ""Bitcoin was born outside of the traditional financial services realm, it was not born into an arena where it was to be traded on a stock market or that it was going to be custodied in the same way that stocks or bonds are.""

Sonnenshein thinks people should not get hung up over the fact that there are only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be in circulation.

Each coin is divisible to the eighth decimal place, meaning that there are a 100 million units inside each Bitcoin. That is one of the asset's features investors like because they can buy just a fraction of the coin and add to their position overtime, Sonnenshein said.

""When you think about how many millionaires or billionaires or even just what the global population is, there's 21 million Bitcoin times the 100 million units within each Bitcoin,"" he said. ""There's a possibility for anyone who wants to get involved to be able to own some piece of the Bitcoin protocol.""

The world's most popular cryptocurrency has had a wild ride this year. It is up 117% so far in 2020, and its price exploded above $18,000 this week.

The price began surging higher in October after PayPal announced it would allow its users to buy, sell, and hold the token. Jack Dorsey's payments company Square invested in nearly 5,000 Bitcoins in October, US tech firm Microstrategy bought 16,796 coins, and UK startup Mode also joined in on the frenzy. Crypto bulls say it is only a matter of time before it is widely adopted.

Blackrock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, said cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, “is here to stay.” In addition, he said bitcoin is a durable mechanism that could replace gold.

Blackrock on Bitcoin and Gold

Rick Rieder, Blackrock’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Global Fixed Income, talked about bitcoin replacing gold in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday.

Blackrock is the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $7.4 trillion in assets under management as of September. Rieder is also Blackrock’s Head of the Global Allocation Investment Team in the Multi-Asset Strategies Group.

Responding to a question about the price of bitcoin and gold and whether he is a bitcoin bull, Rieder said:

I think cryptocurrency is here to stay.

Rieder elaborated: “I think it is durable, and you’ve seen the central banks that have talked about digital currencies. I think digital currency and the receptivity — particularly millennials’ receptivity — of technology and cryptocurrency is real. Digital payment systems are real, so I think bitcoin is here to stay.”

In terms of whether he is a bitcoin bull, Rieder said: “I don’t do a lot of it, or much any of it, in my portfolios, my corporate portfolios, my business portfolios.” While stating that “It’s hard to say whether it’s [bitcoin’s] worth the price it is trading at today,” he affirmed:

But do I think it is a durable mechanism that could replace gold to a large extent? Yeah I do, because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around.

Reid’s comments were very welcome in the crypto community. Former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager Raoul Pal tweeted:

This is huge news. This is the largest asset management firm on earth. 2021 is setting up to be a year of severe supply shortages vs. demand in bitcoin, and upside price dislocations.

Thomas Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, commented that bitcoin is “killing it this year — it’s just crushing all other hedges and asset classes this year, but in 2021 I think bitcoin could be the year of the fireworks … the best is probably yet to come.”

The Blackrock chief investment officer’s comments followed a string of other hedge fund managers saying that they own bitcoin, including Paul Tudor Jones, Bill Miller, and Stan Druckenmiller.

A number of crypto-asset markets saw significant gains on Saturday, as a myriad of digital assets spiked between 4-40% in value during the last 24 hours. The entire crypto market capitalization had risen above $540 billion, as top-ten coin values from the likes of bitcoin cash, cardano and XRP jumped massively in value.

On Saturday, November 21, 2020, the overall market valuation of all 7,000+ crypto-assets in existence is around $520 to $540 billion. At the time of publication, there’s also around $20 to $32 billion in global trade volume as well.

The top digital currency in terms of market cap, bitcoin (BTC) jumped over 1% today and coasted along at a daily high at $18,840 per unit. BTC’s modest gains today is nothing compared to a number of coins that have jumped significantly in value.

The altcoin spark has caused a number of speculators to believe that a highly anticipated ‘altcoin season’ is looming on the horizon. For instance, the third-largest market cap today is held by XRP and the asset saw a 33%+ spike on Saturday driving the price up to $0.42 per unit high.

The second-largest crypto by market valuation, ethereum (ETH) traded for $540 per ether at its high and is still up over 4% today. Chainlink (LINK) jumped over 8% and LINK now trades at over $15 per coin. Litecoin (LTC) has seen a phenomenal week gaining 38% during the last seven days. LTC is up over 7% on Saturday afternoon (EST) and had traded at a daily high at $87.46 per coin.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 14% this week and most of that stems from the 18%+ jump BCH experienced this Saturday. BCH is was swapping for $303 per coin, as the crypto asset crossed over the psychological $300 resistance zone. Currently, BCH is trading between $296 and $301 at the time of publication.

Polkadot (DOT) bounced 6.9% and the crypto asset BNB gained 5% on Saturday. The tenth position in terms of market cap, cardano (ADA), leaped over 17.6% this weekend and was trading at a $0.128 per unit daily high.

The biggest gainer on Saturday is crypto.com’s MCO coin, which gathered 109% in value and the biggest loser is indorse token (IND) which lost 59% today.

According to a number of posts on the Reddit forum r/cryptocurrency and trending conversations on Twitter, numerous individuals believe “altcoin season is back,” because of Saturday’s altcoin market performances. Other notable gainers today include; EOS (15%), XLM (20%), VET (19%), IOTA (19%), DOGE (18%), and ALGO (14%).

“November 2020: Official Altcoin Season Starts. Let the games begin,” tweeted the Twitter account ‘Cryptobud.’

On Wednesday the Bitcoin price surpassed the $18,000 mark, an all-time high since the beginning of 2018.

Its surge has prompted analysts to predict a new increase that could go even higher than the record, reached in December 2017 record, when a Bitcoin was valued at $19,041. This phenomenon has to do with the fact that Bitcoins are somewhat of a “safe investment” for some, and also because online payment system Paypal recently authorized the use of this cryptocurrency on its platform.

As many governments worldwide are unveiling budget stimulus plans to relaunch their economies, in terms of investments the trend is currently toward risk-taking. Cryptocurrencies, with extreme exchange rate volatility, are increasingly wooing investors. Perhaps surprisingly, they are perceived as a safe investment in the long run for some, like gold is for older generations.

Bitcoins can potentially interest anyone as long as they own a computer or a smartphone. Some web users take them as a more or less long-term investment, others use them for money laundering. If a member of the general public wants to start playing with cryptocurrencies, he or she can do so by investing a few euros or dollars in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

But the recent spectacular surge of the Bitcoin price also has to do with Paypal’s announcement that its platform henceforth accepts transactions in Bitcoins in the U.S., and will start doing so elsewhere in the world in 2021. This opens up new horizons for cryptocurrencies, as the online payment system is used on millions of websites (notably eBay). Up until now, spending Bitcoins online was rather confidential, since you needed to sell them to exchange them for local currencies.

The most optimistic economists predict that the Bitcoin price could soar to $250,000 dollars by the end of 2021 (a tenfold growth in a year!) while more conservative experts think that its price will go down in a few months. Three years ago, after having reached an all-time high value ($19,000), the Bitcoin price collapsed in a few weeks, dropping to around $7,000 in the following months.

Analysts note that while Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, other ones are also recording value growth, in particular Litecoin and Ethereum. NVG

How cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work

As bitcoin gyrates, less euphoria in evidence at blockchain gathering

“The Declaration would have the effect that any person furnishing advice or rendering intermediary services in relation to crypto assets must be authorised under the FAIS Act as a financial services provider, and must comply with the requirements of the FAIS Act,” wrote the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), which is seeking comment on the proposal. “This will include crypto asset exchanges and platforms, as well as brokers and advisors.”

How each country treats cryptocurrency has major implications for which regulators oversee crypto activities and what licenses companies have to pursue. In January 2019, South Africa’s central bank published a paper saying regulatory action on crypto assets needed to be prioritized to protect consumers.

The regulator also said the declaration could improve disclosures about the risks of crypto assets to customers looking to invest. The draft doesn’t impact “the status of crypto assets in the context of other laws such as exchange control regulations, requirements under the Pension Fund Act and Collective Investment Schemes Act and so forth, nor does it attempt to regulate, [legitimize] or give credence to crypto assets,” the regulator wrote.

The draft will serve as an “interim step” between more developments from the country’s Crypto Assets Regulatory Working Group, which will impact future crypto policies in South Africa.",2020-11-21 18:32:27+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/85356/visa-mastercard-due-dilligence-crypto-cards,"Payments giants Visa and Mastercard run more stringent checks on crypto firms than on other prospective card issuers.

Would-be crypto partners must produce detailed information about their fraud and money laundering checks before being approved to offer cards to their customers.

Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, described the process as “enhanced diligence on top of what we do for typical issuers”.

With a growing number of wallet and exchange businesses launching cards, the crypto sector has become a fresh battlefield for Visa and Mastercard. Both businesses have advertised advancements in the sector in recent months.

In July, London-based wallet provider Wirex became the first native crypto firm to be granted a principal membership license by Mastercard — a development that came not long after the collapse of Wirex’s former payments partner Wirecard. Mastercard said in a press statement at the time that the expansion of its crypto efforts would make it “simpler and faster for partners to bring secure, compliant” cards to market.

Not to be outdone, Visa announced the expansion of its Fast Track programme in November, giving a wider range of fintech firms access to its network of 61 million merchants. Crypto.com and eToro, both UK-based, were identified as crypto partners that had been given the green light.

“Visa is committed to being the preferred network for crypto wallets. Fast Track is really the first step for having an easy way for having a next generation and new wave of issuers to be able to come to us and get card programmes off the ground,” said Sheffield.

Before getting off the ground, however, crypto companies must convince the card networks that the crypto they hold – which they convert into fiat money when a customer tries to pay for something using their card – arrived on their platform from a reputable source.

“They give you a heightened review process which is effectively, ‘I want to see everything you put towards your regulators in terms of anti-money laundering’,” said Mark Hipperson, whose London-based crypto wallet and exchange platform Ziglu recently launched a Mastercard debit card. This includes information on ‘know your customer’, anti-money laundering and fraud checks, as well as transaction monitoring.

Wirex chief executive Pavel Matveev, who has experience working with both Visa and Mastercard, said Visa homes in on individual transactions using tools such as Chainalysis and Elliptic – which Wirex also uses – to ask whether they originate from “legitimate sources”.

“They both [Visa and Mastercard] ask about how we store crypto, what security measures we have in place, what are our screening policies, but it’s fair to say that Visa goes a bit deeper. They even ask about specific cryptocurrency transactions… which was quite surprising for us to be honest,” he said.

A Mastercard spokesperson pointed to principles established in October 2019, which dictate that the company’s crypto partners must provide “strong consumer protection, including privacy and security of the consumers’ information and transactions”.

These principles also require “full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those applicable to anti-money laundering,” according to the company.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-21/why-tomorrow-s-money-will-come-in-new-crypto-flavors-quicktake,"Why did this happen?

There is plenty of advice online and we understand you could be stuck for choices. You probably clicked this link because you are curious to know what successful traders know.

Over the past couple of years, most professional traders have switched to cryptocurrency trading having in mind there is a resolute chance of reaping big. This trend will possibly continue expanding as digital assets develop becoming bigger and better. Although the industry is still new and developing, this has not stopped traders from generating profits from the market.

Cryptocurrency can be a lucrative profit generator and at the same time, a time lapse for financial risk. The following tips document the wins and woes of crypto traders. Things you should and perhaps a few mistakes you should avoid doing.

Ensure you Diversify

Distribute your financial stakes across different assets. This ensures you share the risk across multiple trades , and therefore prevents massive losses. While diversifying , remember to choose your cryptocurrencies wisely. Do not go for a digital asset because it’s cheap. Starting traders might be tempted to believe that a coin they bought at $2 will surge to $300. A situation like that is very unlikely and mostly took place in the early days of bitcoin. Diversification makes sure you don’t place all your eggs in one basket.

Backup Some Savings

Do not go into crypto trading with all your savings. Digital assets are extremely volatile and profit making is mainly speculative. The venture also requires a lot of patience and sometimes the need to only invest what you are comfortable to lose. Being able to shoulder the idea of losing will prevent you from panic trading. Make it a principle to only trade what you are ready to lose. Also do not use funds from loans to finance your trading venture. While you could borrow, employ brilliant strategies such as where a real estate investor acquires a profit generating asset after borrowing a loan.

Keep you Job

Do not quit your job. Do not let the idea of winning more profits get into your head. The hypercompetitive crypto landscape may end up persuading you into thinking crypto will make you a quick millionaire. In fact, the prospect of leaving your job and completing jumping into crypto trading might sound clever. This is because trading requires a calm mind to make proper market decisions.

Fundamental and Technical Analysis

Fundamental analysis are the differences between an asset’s value and the price it currently trade at. On the hand, technical analysis is the price action of an asset depending on the dynamics of demand and supply. Professional traders take advantage of these indicators to identify profitable signals.

This will boost your trading strategies.

Always follow Bitcoin

Bitcoin trading tips are almost everywhere today. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be invented and has remained to be a relevant and convenient choice for traders. No matter your choice of crypto, it is recommended to always follow Bitcoin. It is significant to have in mind that most altcoins in the market are traded against Bitcoin as opposed to fiat currency. Additionally, most of the altcoins in the market follow the behaviour pattern of Bitcoin as well.

Consequently, in the majority of cases, when the price of bitcoin rises or drops, the possibility of the other altcoins following the trend is high. Although this doesn’t happen always, it is vital to bear in mind this factor when trading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin trading tips for beginners are also very crucial to professional traders.",2020-11-22 23:39:06+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ccb-blockchain-bonds-idUSKBN2830DE,"FILE PHOTO: A sign of China Construction Bank is seen at its booth at the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China September 4, 2020.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A $3 billion bond arranged by a China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) unit using blockchain technology, for listing on a Malaysian cryptocurrency-focused exchange, has been withdrawn at the issuer’s request, the exchange said.

The bond was to be issued by Longbond Ltd, a special purpose vehicle created solely to issue digital bonds and deposit the proceeds with CCB’s branch in Labuan, a Malaysian offshore financial centre.

CCB Labuan was lead arranger and listing sponsor of the bond, which was to be tradable on the FUSANG exchange, a Labuan-based trading platform focused on digital assets including cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin.

On Monday, FUSANG said that on 13 Nov., the day the bond had been due to be traded, it had received a letter from CCB Labuan on behalf of Longbond postponing the listing, and on 20 Nov. was informed by CCB Labuan that the issuance would not proceed.

The bank did not give a reason for the suspension, FUSANG Chief Executive Henry Chong said.

A CCB representative in Beijing declined to comment.

Earlier this month, following media reports about the bond, the bank said CCB Labuan was not the issuer of the bond, and that the branch did not accept Bitcoin.",2020-11-23 05:54:25+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/godaddy-employees-tricked-into-transferring-control-of-crypto-firm-domains-report,"Cryptocurrency trading platform liquid.com and crypto mining firm NiceHash were two of at least six firms that had control of their domains briefly transferred to malicious actors last week after employees at GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, were again tricked by fraudsters, KrebsOnSecurity reported.",2020-11-22 13:23:41+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/22/forget-bitcoin-these-growth-stocks-can-run-circles/,"This has been a trying year for Wall Street and the investment community. Though volatility is always present in the stock market, the swings we've witnessed this year are far beyond historical norms. For instance, the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially sent the benchmark S&P 500 lower by 34% in less than five weeks. For some context, it's taken the S&P 500 an average of 11 months to decline 30% during previous bear markets.

But not all assets have been clobbered by COVID-19 concerns. The most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, bitcoin, has been virtually unstoppable this year. By the early afternoon of Wednesday, Nov. 18, bitcoin was up 148% on a year-to-date basis, which is considerably better than the year-to-date return of 10% for the broad-based S&P 500.

Why the resurgence for bitcoin? There's no obvious answer. With bitcoin not being tethered to a fiat currency or having traditional fundamental metrics that can be critiqued by investors, its price movements are almost always driven by emotions.

What I can comfortably say is that bitcoin is a potentially dangerous (if not terrible) long-term investment. The market value of all bitcoin currently circulating is $328.3 billion, which pales in comparison to global gross domestic product of $81 trillion in 2017. What's more, around 40% of all bitcoin holders aren't using their digital tokens -- they're simply sitting on them for investment purposes. This means bitcoin's utility is minimal in the real world. Broader-based adoption at the retail level is extremely unlikely.

Bitcoin also lacks scarcity. Whereas physical materials like gold can be truly scarce (i.e., we can only mine the gold we find on Earth), bitcoin's perceived scarcity is a product of software programming. It can, in theory, have its token count increased.

I strongly believe investors should ditch bitcoin and put their money to work in innovative growth stocks. These companies have tangible fundamentals, substance behind their financial reports, and real products.

Here are three growth stocks that can run circles around cryptocurrency.

CrowdStrike Holdings

It might not be the fastest-growing industry this decade, but there's little doubt that cybersecurity is going to be the safest double-digit growth trend of the 2020s. That's why cloud-native cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a much smarter long-term investment opportunity than bitcoin.

Cybersecurity is now a basic-need service. Hackers and robots don't care if the economy is in a recession or if a business is struggling. With the pandemic forcing businesses online and, in many instances, into the cloud, those businesses have no choice but to seek out on-premises or third-party security solutions to protect sensitive data.

Built within the cloud, CrowdStrike's Falcon platform is considerably cheaper than on-premises cloud-security solutions. It also happens to be faster and smarter at detecting threats. That's because Falcon leans on artificial intelligence to evaluate more than 3 trillion events each week.

The beauty of CrowdStrike's subscription-based model is that it's designed to scale with its clients' growth. Back in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, a mere 9% of the company's clients had subscribed to four or more cloud modules. But by the fiscal second quarter of 2021 (13 quarters later), 57% of its clients had four or more cloud module subscriptions. Scalability and increased spending by existing clients enabled CrowdStrike to reach its long-term adjusted subscription gross margin target of between 75% and 80%.

Cybersecurity looks to be a surefire winner for patient investors, and CrowdStrike should be one of the top performers within the industry.

Cresco Labs

U.S.-focused marijuana stocks also have a good chance at outperforming emotionally driven cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the long run. I'd suggest investors consider multistate operator Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF).

Though it's listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) exchange and not a major U.S. exchange, don't be alarmed. Cresco can't uplist to a major exchange only because cannabis is illegal at the federal level. While OTC-listed stocks don't have the best reputations, Cresco is the exception to that rule.

The first of two operating models that will drive Cresco Labs' growth is its retail operations. Nearly half of its operational dispensaries are located in Illinois. The Land of Lincoln opened its doors to recreational weed sales on Jan. 1, 2020, and should become a market capable of more than $1 billion in annual sales by 2024.

The second and arguably more exciting opportunity for Cresco is its wholesale segment. In January 2020, Cresco acquired Origin House in an all-share deal. Whereas most pot stock deals were about capacity, this buyout was about Cresco Labs getting its hands on Origin House's cannabis distribution license in California. The completion of this deal meant Cresco could place its products into more than 575 dispensaries throughout the most lucrative state for weed sales in the country. In the recently ended third quarter, Cresco racked up an industry-leading $90.5 million in wholesale revenue.

With a real shot at hitting recurring profitability in 2021 and perhaps topping $1 billion in sales by 2022 or 2023, Cresco Labs is a much smarter buy than bitcoin.

Facebook

Megacap stocks can be growth stocks, too. Just because social media kingpin Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has a $775 billion market cap doesn't mean its growth rate has slowed to a crawl. In fact, I'm pretty confident that Facebook can run circles around bitcoin.

Facebook ended September with 2.74 billion monthly active users and 3.21 billion family monthly active people, up about 40 million and 70 million from the end of June, respectively. These family plans include other owned sites, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Advertisers fully understand that there isn't a platform on this planet that gets them more targeted eyeballs. This gives Facebook exceptional ad pricing power, even during a pandemic.

Facebook hasn't even played its full deck of cards yet. It's monetizing Facebook and Instagram via ads, but not Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. These are four of the six most-visited social platforms in the world, and Facebook has only tapped the keg, so to speak, on two of them. There's real opportunity for Facebook to double its sales and cash flow over the next four years if it introduces ads or revenue channels on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.

The company also has opportunities to expand its revenue base. For now, ads comprise 99% of Facebook's sales. However, Facebook has avenues to expand into the payment space, or it could become a popular content streaming destination in coming years.

The choice between owning bitcoin and Facebook stock is a no-brainer: Facebook all the way.",2020-11-22 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/kucoin-recovering-from-hack-resumes-deposit-withdrawal-services-for-all-tokens,"KuCoin, the Singapore-headquartered digital asset exchange that was hacked to the tune of $281 million in September, said it has restored the deposit and withdrawal services of all tokens as of Sunday.

Due to ongoing judicial proceedings for some tokens, daily withdrawal limits will be put in place for a few tokens, the exchange said. Those limits will be removed after the judicial process has been completed, KuCoin said. In the meantime, those tokens with daily limits will have zero trading fees, the exchange said.

KuCoin immediately moved to freeze all wallets and disable services.

Coinbase has revealed that it has had “an explosion of incoming capital.” Its assets under custody currently stand at $20 billion, $14 billion of which were accumulated since April. Coinbase highlights a string of bullish events that have “really unleashed” a wave of institutional adoption.

Coinbase Has $20 Billion Under Custody

Coinbase’s Head of Institutional Coverage, Brett Tejpaul, talked about institutional demand for bitcoin in an interview with Heidrick & Struggles International, published on Friday.

Tejpaul has 25 years of experience in sales and trading, with almost 17 years at Barclays, and nine years at JPMorgan. He explained that he joined Coinbase six months ago, and is now “responsible for growing the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, across sales, trading, custody, and Prime.” Prime is Coinbase’s services for institutional clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and VCs.

“It’s a phenomenal time for crypto … Sometimes timing is everything,” Tejpaul opined. “We have had an explosion of activity,” he added, elaborating:

I joined in April this year, at that time our assets, institutional assets under custody were $6 billion, today we stand at over $20 billion, so more than a three time increase.

“Earlier in the summer, we acquired an execution platform called Tagomi and it brought with us overnight, it radically transformed our ability to cater to institutional clients that want to use smart order routing and algorithmic execution, so the stat there is that our trading volumes are 20 times what they were in the beginning of the year,” Tejpaul continued.

“We are now measuring the fresh capital coming into crypto, principally being allocated to bitcoin in the billions,” he described, noting:

Week after week after week, we’ve had an explosion of incoming capital.

Tejpaul said that Coinbase has “upgraded” its banking and auditing partners: JPMorgan and Deloitte. “Both of those firms went through one to two year period of due diligence to satisfy themselves that we have the right KYC, AML, and the fact that we sort of posture ourselves and act like a bank and we have opted into being regulated, and so we are a safe onramp.”

He then highlighted recent bullish events in the crypto space, beginning with famed hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who said in May that he put about 2% of his portfolio into bitcoin. In October, Jones said that he saw much upside to bitcoin.

Jones’ decision “was important because it served as a calling card to other traditional macro firms, which are thinking about bitcoin as a store of value, bitcoin as a potential tail risk hedge to the portfolio,” Tejpaul detailed, adding:

We have seen an unbelievable wave of institutions follow Paul’s lead.

He also mentioned the Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy that invested $425 million in bitcoin and made the cryptocurrency its primary Treasury reserve asset. CEO Michael Saylor has become a bitcoin bull, personally investing $240 million in BTC.

Other famed hedge fund managers who have made bullish statements about bitcoin include Bill Miller, who said every major bank will eventually have exposure to bitcoin, and Stan Druckenmiller, who called bitcoin an attractive store of value that could beat gold.

Tejpaul further shared what a typical day for him is like on the podcast. “By 9:30 in the morning, I had five separate institutional clients called to invest over $100 million each.” He explained that people sitting on the sideline “are now looking at major banks, major accounting firms, major hedge funds, major endowments, and now Paypal getting into this space,” concluding:

It’s really unleashed a second wave of institutional adoption.

Ethereum is rallying, the image suggests.

A programmable version of the scene just described made records this weekend when a non-fungible representation sold for 260 ETH, or approximately $141,536.20. That’s the most paid, in dollar terms, for a work of crypto art to date, according to one of the painting’s co-creators, Trevor Jones.

Not your average NFT. A collaboration between crypto artists Jones and Alotta Money, the digital painting “EthBoy,” a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Ethereum co-founder Buterin, uses new programmable technology called “layering” to remake itself daily.

An innovation enabled by the blockchain-based art market and platform Async Art, which EthBoy was released on, allows digital artworks to reflect external data and stimuli. EthBoy will change every day, “in response to external variables out of ours or anyone else's control,” Jones’ website reads.

“[A]s the months and years progress EthBoy on Async will become an artistic, visual representation of Ethereum relating to factors including price fluctuations, gas fees, an accessory layer connected to one of Vitalik's wallet address and even annual changes triggered by Vitalik’s birthday and the initial release of the Ethereum system,” the site continues.

The painting is the first such programmable art project released on Async, which launched in February and has since seen over $600,000 in artist sales.

The artwork is a 1/1, an industry term for a digital artwork that has only one official version. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, derive their value from cryptographically derived scarcity. The same underpinning that ensure each bitcoin is one of a kind and cannot be double spent can be applied to any digital object rendered as an NFT.

More than ownership. Twitter user Maxstealth is now the owner of the unique painting, following a day-long auction. The sale can be observed here. But it’s more than a collector’s item, as the painting’s unique characteristics continue to yield revenue for its owner and creators.

Twice a year, for the next five years, mini-animations based on the painting will be auctioned off as separate NFTs on the crypto marketplace OpenSea.

Each animation will consist of approximately 182 days of changes taking place between July 30, the anniversary of the Ethereum system release and Vitalik's birthday, Jan. 31.

The profit on the sale of each work will be divided three ways between the two artists and the owner of the EthBoy NFT, with a “small amount” of the profit used to fund the further programmable development of the original, if necessary.

Jones’ year. Jones made headlines earlier this year for his record-setting (at the time) release of “Picasso’s Bull.” Last month, his Batman-themed Genesis drop on MakersPlace sold for 302 ETH. While “EthBoy” only brought in 260 ETH, below Async’s largest sale of 263 to date, it is likely the most paid for a digital painting, in terms of price.

“I think that's the largest NFT art sale to date,” Jones said in direct message. Meanwhile, co-creator Alotta Money tweeted: “I'm stunned and happy but stunned. Happy though. But stunned.”",2020-11-22 19:42:44+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/jeff-bezos-african-app-chipper-cash-cryptocurrency-trading/,"Jeff Bezos-Backed African App Chipper Cash Launching Crypto Trading After Raising $30 Million

An African company backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Chipper Cash, has raised $30 million and is launching a cryptocurrency trading service due to high demand for cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Users of Chipper Cash will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies as well as U.S. stocks, such as Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, through the app.

Jeff Bezos-Backed Chipper Cash to Begin Offering Crypto Trading

African cross-border payments startup Chipper Cash has raised $30 million in a Series B funding round. It was led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, with the participation of Bezos Expeditions, the personal VC fund of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

Founded in 2018 by Ugandan Ham Serunjogi and Ghanaian Maijid Moujaled, the San Francisco-based Chipper Cash offers fee-free mobile P2P payment services. The services are available in seven African countries: Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, and Kenya. The app allows users to send and receive money across Africa. “Enjoy free transfers and the lowest cross-border rates,” its website describes.

The Chipper Cash platform has three million users and processes about 80,000 transactions daily on average. CEO Serunjogi said that in June the app reached a monthly payments value of $100 million.

Chipper Cash plans to use the funds raised to provide additional products and services as well as expand into more countries. “On the product side, that entails offering more business payment solutions, crypto-currency trading options, and investment services,” Techcrunch reported Thursday and quoted Serunjogi as saying:

We’ve had demand from our users to offer other value services … like purchasing cryptocurrency assets and making investments in stocks.

Chipper Cash has already added on its website and app the option to buy and sell bitcoin in beta. Users can also invest in U.S. stocks through the app from Africa via a partnership with U.S. financial services company Drivewealth.

The stock product will launch in Nigeria first and then expand to other countries, Serunjogi explained, adding that Nigerians will “have the option to buy fractional stocks — Tesla shares, Apple shares or Amazon shares and others — through our app.”

Bezos is now the world’s richest person. Forbes reported in August that the Amazon CEO became the world’s first-ever person to amass a $200 billion fortune.

Serunjogi believes that the backing of well-known investors such as Jeff Bezos benefits Africa as a whole. He opined: “It’s a big deal when a world class investor like Bezos or Ribbit goes out of their sweet spot to a new area where they previously haven’t done investments … Ultimately, the winner of those things happening is the African tech ecosystem overall, as it will bring more investment from firms of that caliber to African startups.”

Ethereum and Ripple are soaring, echoing the powerful rally in Bitcoin, as mass interest in cryptocurrencies picks up steam.

Ethereum has jumped almost four-fold this year to just below $600, although this is still short of its record $1,500 in January 2018.

The price of smaller crypto rival Ripple has hit its highest since mid-2019, having doubled in value in this month alone.

This growing interest raises red flags, because many people are pouring in money into cryptocurrencies without really understanding how they work, which could lead to several mistakes and lost money, a researcher said.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Bitcoin's growing reputation as an inflation hedge is boosting the price of other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency platform in the world, rose by more than 6% to $597 on Monday, its highest since mid 2018.

Ethereum is still well below its all-time high of about $1,500 recorded in January 2018, but its price has increased four-fold since March 2020, when the pandemic brought global money markets to a grinding halt. Smaller rival Ripple's price has doubled in the month of November alone.

The sudden price surge could be explained in large part because of Bitcoin's massive rally this year. The digital token is up 160% on the year and was trading around $18,632 on Monday, near three-year highs.

Markets Insider

While both crypto assets have risen massively in price, their market capitalization is still dwarfed by Bitcoin. Ethereum represents about $40.6 billion in market cap, Ripple stands at about $48.5 billion, while Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $336 billion last week.

Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of the world's biggest crypto fund Grayscale Investments, told Business Insider last week that he believes Bitcoin is the next step in the evolution of money.

As the pandemic continues to quarantine huge swathes of the global population, people are spending more time online, and they're probably getting more interested in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bernard Meyer, senior researcher at CyberNews.com, said.

""But because it's all so technical, they're probably investing in these cryptocurrencies without really being certain of what they're doing – which can lead to a lot of mistakes and money lost,"" he said.

In the past, a number of high-profile hacking and security breaches resulted in millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being stolen on various platforms. While security across the major trading platforms has tightened up, would-be Ethereum buyers need to make sure they are familiar with their token's smart contract - a form of account on the Ethereum blockchain that can send transactions across the network.

""If they're on Ethereum, they'll be using what's known as a smart contract to sort of automate the process of sending and receiving payments for users. But these smart contracts can have some big security holes in them,"" Meyer said.

Investors need to check the type of smart contract they're using and whether it has been audited and verified, to limit the chances of something going wrong.

Key Takeaways PayPal’s recent entry into cryptocurrencies has renewed growth in Bitcoin’s payment narrative.

Companies like BitPay, Lolli, and Honey have been laying the groundwork for Bitcoin payments through free rewards, merchant partnerships, and institutional products.

The latest swarm of billionaire investors have bought Bitcoin for one reason: Its store of value narrative. Still, with the arrival of PayPal, the original peer-to-peer electronic cash may find renewed strength as a medium of exchange.

Invoicing PayPal With Bitcoin

PayPal’s entry has made a huge impact on the crypto industry since announcing its adoption of various digital assets. Over 346 million users are now allowed to buy, sell, and store Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

ItBit exchange, which acts as a proxy for Paypal’s trading volume, is doing up to $35 million in trading volume daily.

Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum, has attracted many new investors in the on-going economic crisis. And, PayPal is clearly capitalizing on this uptick even if payments have been restricted upon rollout.

Nevertheless, Dan Schulman, the CEO of PayPal, has confirmed that customers will be able to make crypto payments starting next year. PayPal will convert customers’ crypto into fiat or any desired option for the merchant in real-time. Schulman said in a CNBC interview:

“Early next year we’re going to allow cryptocurrencies to be a funding source for any transaction happening on all 28 billion of our merchants. That will significantly bolster the usage of cryptocurrencies.”

Long before PayPal, BitPay has been one of the leading service providers in this space, enabling conversion of customer’s crypto to make fiat payments to merchants or companies. While PayPal’s entry threatens the company, BitPay’s CEO Stephen Pair believes that:

“We’re competitors, but there are also opportunities for BitPay to partner with PayPal.”

The crypto payments service provider has launched a new product, “BitPay Send,” for businesses and organizations sending out crypto payments.

The service is for individuals or freelancers who are willing to earn a portion or all of their salary in Bitcoin for investment purposes. Moreover, the companies need not custody Bitcoin themselves as BitPay Send converts fiat into crypto at the time of payment.

Their new endeavor’s motivation began in-house as their employees demanded full or part of their remuneration in crypto. Pair said:

“This is the first time that we’re going to help companies with paying out crypto. It could be to employees, publishers, affiliates – any demographic that you want to pay out via crypto.”

AdGate Media is one of the first adopters of the new feature. AdGate is building an ecosystem for rewarded advertising on mobile applications. The ads give users credit or in-app purchases by taking surveys, trying new apps, and signing up for special offers. The websites and ad publishers, on the other hand, earn from their clients.

According to AdGate’s CEO Dan Sapozhnikov, there was a demand from publishers who wanted to get paid in crypto. He said:

“There’s definitely a good dollar range where BitPay does make a lot of sense for some of our publishers, especially cross border payments. Banking is a bit more difficult where an international wire can cost around $45. There are a lot of times that Bitcoin does make sense.”

Currently, BitPay processes about 100,000 transactions daily, whereas PayPal handles millions. According to Pair, however, his company will soon make up this gap as users begin to realize the benefits of crypto. He said:

“Paypal getting into this validates what we already knew for the past ten years. It just shows that cryptocurrency or blockchain payment is going mainstream.”

Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency posting strong gains lately. Ether, XRP and a handful of other so-called ""altcoins,"" or alternative cryptocurrencies, rallied Monday, following the world's best-known digital currency higher. At around 9:15 a.m. ET, ether passed the $600 level, a point it hasn't reached since June 2018, according to data from industry site CoinDesk. XRP at one point surged 29% to almost 55 cents, hitting its highest level in over two years.

Ether was last trading up about 8% in the last 24 hours at $595, having earlier risen as much as 13%, while XRP was 19% higher at around 54 cents. Both are up about 350% and 180% respectively year-to-date. Crypto industry investors said altcoins were tracking the momentum that has seen bitcoin surge recently. Bitcoin last week crossed the $18,000 threshold and is close to an all-time high near $20,000, which it hit in late 2017 before slumping as low as $3,122 the following year.",2020-11-23 00:00:00,https://moguldom.com/319108/3-reasons-ethereum-went-parabolic-and-is-rising-faster-than-bitcoin3-reasons-ethereum-went-parabolic-and-is-rising-faster-than-bitcoin/,"3 Reasons Ethereum Went Parabolic And Is Rising Faster Than Bitcoin

3 Reasons Ethereum Went Parabolic And Is Rising Faster Than Bitcoin. Photo by Moose Photos from Pexels

The price of ethereum, the second most popular digital token, increased by 14 percent in 24 hours over the weekend, reaching $600 — the highest since June 2018 — after breaking $500 three days ago.

The cryptocurrency was at $389 on Aug. 23, increasing 54 percent in the last three months.

By comparison, bitcoin’s price today reached $18,513, up by 37 percent from its price of $11,627 three months ago. Over the last week, all the top 10 cryptocurrencies have increased in price. Ripple leads the way with a 78-percent increase, Decrypt reported.

Here are three reasons ethereum went parabolic and is rising faster than bitcoin.

Bitcoin rising tide lifts all boats

Crypto enthusiast Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square announced the purchase of 4,709 bitcoins in October — a $50 million investment that represents 1 percent of the firm’s total assets. Square’s Cash App product allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin.

PayPal plans to let customers and the 26 million merchants on its network buy, sell and shop using bitcoin and other virtual coins. It plans to expand the service to Venmo in 2021.

Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run is thought to be more from institutional endorsements than its 2017 retail boom. In 2017, bitcoin rose to an all-time high price of almost $20,000. The price crashed to about $3,000 in 2018, but retail demand could be just around the corner, Forbes reported.

The cryptocurrency community is gearing up for a pre-Thanksgiving surge and may get a boost from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

Ethereum’s upward trend has risen alongside strong performance by Bitcoin, which can drag the market along with it.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) and a hedge against inflation

Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a hedge against inflation is boosting the price of other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is still far below its all-time high of about $1,500 in January 2018, but its price has increased four-fold since March 2020, when the pandemic brought global money markets to a halt, Business Insider reported.

Ethereum has a $40.6 billion market cap compared to bitcoin’s all-time high of $336 billion last week.

During the pandemic, people are spending more time online and learning about cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, said Bernard Meyer, senior researcher at CyberNews.com.

Daily transaction fees, also known as daily gas usage, on ethereum are at an all-time high, according to on-chain data from Etherscan.

When gas usage is high, the on-chain user activity is rising, Cointelegraph reported.

Increase in daily gas usage on Ethereum likely comes from two sources, according to Cointelegraph:

Deposits to the Eth2 address

A growing number of decentralized finance users.

Decentralized finance or DeFi is the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance. This peer-to-peer finance is enabled by decentralized technologies built on the ethereum blockchain, according to ConsenSys, which claims to be the largest venture production studio in the blockchain ecosystem.

ConsenSys was founded by Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, in 2014. From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized BTC, the DeFi ecosystem has launched an expansive network of integrated protocols and financial instruments.

“Now with over $13 billion worth of value locked in ethereum smart contracts, decentralized finance has emerged as the most active sector in the blockchain space, with a wide range of use cases for individuals, developers, and institutions,” Consensys said.

Anticipation of ethereum 2.0 upgrade

Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2 is a network upgrade scheduled for Dec. 1 that’s supposed to solve the coin’s scalability issues. The network needs 524,288 ETH ($315 million) to be staked on it before it can to launch. So far, about half of this amount has been staked, Decrypt reported. It’s not looking good for the initial launch date.

When it’s active, Eth2 is expected to improve the transaction capacity of the Ethereum blockchain network.

He discusses the Democratic Party’s sneaky relationship with the police in cities and states under Dem control, and why Joe Biden is a cop and the Steve Jobs of mass incarceration.

Tight now, the ethereum blockchain can process a maximum of 15 transactions per second, resulting in network congestion and high transaction fees, Benzinga reported. The plan is to upgrade the network to accommodate 10,000 transactions per second.

Ethereum prides itself on being “one of the most decentralized and secure blockchain systems available today. And it is hellbent on maintaining this status,” according to Benzinga.

Ethereum 2.0 will be rolled out in a sequence of updates divided with four phases projected to last until 2022.

All the upgrades will have no noticeable effect for users and are compatible with existing infrastructure. User don’t need to download special tools and there is no plan to create a new cryptocurrency. ETH will remain the native coin. Users are urged to beware of platforms, ads, and campaigns encouraging them to deposit ETH to receive Eth2.0.

Also, some believe that the upgrades will have a positive effect on the price of ETH, reduce transaction fees and increase network engagements.



",2020-11-23 19:17:09+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-crypto-currency-expansion-idUKKBN2830N3,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As the price of bitcoin soars, Chinese cryptocurrency asset managers are looking to expand in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore, skirting an intensified crackdown at home.

Cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds have grown assets under management and registered hefty gains this year thanks to bitcoin’s recent surge to over $18,000, close to its 2017 high.

At the same time, Beijing has been tightening already strict scrutiny over cryptocurrencies as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) prepares to launch its own digital currency, partly a response to the threat from currencies like bitcoin, officials say.

Beijing banned virtual currency trading in 2017, stopping a free-wheeling emerging crypto industry, and causing China’s share of global bitcoin trading to slump to less than 4%, from nearly 17% in 2017, according to CoinShare, Europe’s biggest digital asset manager.

Consequently, Chinese businessmen are looking elsewhere to raise crypto-focused funds, following the path of some of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms which were founded in China but moved overseas in 2017.

This month, Babel Finance, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency financial services provider founded by Chinese entrepreneur Flex Yang, applied for an asset management license in the city, Yang said.

A license in the Asian financial hub would help Babel become a “gateway” between traditional financial institutions and crypto investing, said Yang, who dreams of creating “the JPMorgan in the field of cryptocurrency.”

If Babel receives a licence, Yang hopes to raise $1 billion, dwarfing existing funds in the city licenced under special rules for crypto-focused asset managers.

Gordon Chen, a former bitcoin trader in Beijing co-founded cryptocurrency asset manager GMR in Singapore last year, betting on growing demand from high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors.

Chen, who currently manages over $20 million of bitcoin assets, said he chose Singapore because of its regulatory structure. “Whether it’s in the U.S., or Singapore, digital currency business is being increasingly regulated.”

Singapore-based Onchain Custodian, which counts Chinese conglomerate Fosun as an investor is expanding too - even in China.

The company, which safeguards digital assets for institutional clients, plans to open an office in China to initially provide consultancy services in blockchain technology

However, activities onshore are still limited by regulation.

In October, the PBOC outlawed private issuance of digital currencies, and Malta-headquartered exchange OKEX was forced to suspend crypto currency withdrawals for a month because an executive was assisting Chinese law enforcement with their enquiries.

GMR’s Chen lamented that China has lost its global pricing power, as well as its role as a key hub for bitcoin trading and mining: “China’s first-mover advantage has vanished.”",2020-11-23 08:01:06+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/crypto-bulls-on-whats-next-for-bitcoin-as-it-nears-an-all-time-high.html,"studioEAST | Getty Images

Bitcoin is back. The cryptocurrency last week passed the $18,000 level for the first time since its all-time peak in December 2017. As the digital currency — which is up over 150% this year — moves closer than ever to its record high of almost $20,000, CNBC asked five crypto experts for their take on the latest rally. Is bitcoin's meteoric rise in value now different than the speculative frenzy of late 2017 and early 2018? And where does the price of bitcoin go from here? Here's what they said:

What's different this time round?

Many commentators in the industry say the crypto market has matured over the last three years. ""The main difference between now and the 2017 rally is that back then the market was driven by retail speculation and now it's being driven by corporations and billionaires,"" said Mati Greenspan, portfolio manager and founder of Quantum Economics. Wall Street incumbent Fidelity, for instance, set up a new unit to let its clients invest in digital assets, while PayPal recently started letting its U.S. users buy, hold and sell a range of virtual currencies. And there are now big-name investors putting their money into bitcoin, including billionaire hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.

""There was nothing conspicuous about their involvement,"" said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of crypto lender Nexo. ""They purchased in stealth mode but once bitcoin made it to their treasuries, they let the world know, similar to the gold bull market in the 1970s."" Then there's the coronavirus pandemic. Crypto fans have compared bitcoin to safe-haven assets like gold, which investors often flock to in times of economic turbulence. They claim that Covid-related stimulus measures have lessened the appeal of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, bitcoin underwent a key technical event earlier this year called the ""halving,"" which saw the amount of bitcoins rewarded to the so-called ""miners"" who add bitcoin transactions to its public ledger get cut in half. Some analysts say this event has also contributed to the asset's climb in 2020.

Where does bitcoin go from here?

There are plenty of sky-high predictions for what price bitcoin could zoom to in the near-to-long term. But many crypto enthusiasts agree bitcoin is likely to pass its all-time high soon. ""A new all-time high is not only possible but is largely anticipated by bitcoin believers to happen any day now,"" said Greenspan.

Pascal Gauthier, CEO of crypto hardware wallet maker Ledger, said he thinks the latest bitcoin bull run will last for longer than the previous one. ""Bitcoin has reached market recognition and maturity, making it the one coin that is definitely here to stay,"" he said. ""2021 will be exciting and will still be about building great products and tech but this time with the wind blowing in the sails."" Some crypto bulls have already given bold predictions for where the price of bitcoin could go next. Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment firm Galaxy Digital, thinks bitcoin could reach $55,000 to $60,000 by the end of the year — though he also once said it could ""easily"" hit $40,000 by the end of 2018.

Words of caution?

The cryptocurrency has a reputation for extreme volatility. It plummeted as low as $3,122 in 2018 after rallying to nearly $20,000 a year earlier. In the last week alone, bitcoin has added more than $2,000 and was at $18,485.60 on Monday morning ET.",2020-11-23 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-retirement-us-investment-firm-launches-employer-sponsored-bitcoin-401k-plan/,"Crypto Retirement: US Investment Firm Launches Employer-Sponsored Bitcoin 401(k) Plan

The U.S.-based company Digital Asset Investment Management (Daim) has announced the launch of a company-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan that allocates up to 10% in bitcoin. The plan is an ERISA compliant employer-sponsored 401(k) and assets are held in institutional-grade cold storage by leveraging the custodian Gemini Trust.

During the last few years, investors have been able to leverage a digital currency retirement plan in the form of an IRA. For instance, the company Bitcoinira helps people invest in cryptocurrencies like BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC with the firm’s cryptocurrency-focused retirement funds. On Thursday, November 19, 2020, the Newport Beach California-based company Digital Asset Investment Management (Daim) revealed an ERISA compliant employer-sponsored bitcoin 401(k) plan that involves an allocation of BTC.

“From the moment we were approved by the State of California in June 2018, we’ve seen incredible inbound demand from individuals eager to invest bitcoin in 401(k)s,” Adam Pokornicky, COO of Daim said during the launch. “Conventional 401(k) plans are restrictive and often lack investment options, causing participants to not only be frustrated but have poor risk-adjusted returns that barely keep up with the rate of inflation.”

“This is a bad deal for savers given the current environment. We believe bitcoin has demonstrated it has a place in the modern portfolio and individuals should have an opportunity to “Get Off Zero” and invest directly through their retirement account,” the Daim executive added.

According to Daim, the firm will be the 3(38) advisor and fiduciary and it will assist companies who want to offer the 401(k). The plans have traditional assets alongside up to a 10% allocation in bitcoin (BTC). “Bitcoin will be held securely in institutional cold storage custody with Gemini Trust, our partner for our primary investment advisory services. The California firm also explains what happens when an employee leaves a company offering the bitcoin 401(k) plan.

Daim states:

Should the employee leave their company their Bitcoin will be able to transfer with them. And should an individual want to allocate more to Bitcoin, they can schedule an investment consultation with Daim.

Pokornicky also notes that Daim executed an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan back in October 2019 and has been testing for 12 months. Daim is now allowed to launch “scalable 401(k) plans that provide recordkeeping and administrative services.” “[Daim is] excited to lend our fiduciary capacity to enable access to Bitcoin in 401(k) plans in this way,” Pokornicky shared.

Other companies that offer bitcoin-related retirement services besides Daim and Bitcoinira include Bitira, Coinira, and Regal Assets. While the digital asset ecosystem continues to grow concepts like retirement services have tapped into the swelling crypto economy.

401(k) plans give employees tax advantages and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows 401(k) or IRAs. With digital currency prices posting massive gains in recent days, a bitcoin-based 401(k) may prove to have a much larger retirement yield.

What do you think about Daim launching an ERISA compliant employer-sponsored 401(k) with a 10% bitcoin allocation? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The buyers, introduced by Denison Yachting broker Michelle Ropiza, purchased the sailing yacht using a combination of US dollars and cryptocurrency.

Despite its somewhat murky reputation, cryptocurrency may become more common in future yacht deals. Bitcoin is perhaps the most well-known form of the digital, unregulated currency that’s traded anonymously, without banks or middlemen. Payments are made through a digital wallet on a computer or smartphone.

Bob Denison, president of the Fort Lauderdale-based firm, said the “vast majority of sellers” have no interest in accepting cryptocurrency, so Denison Yachting has moved to assist the buyers with crypto-deals. He said the 52 Lagoon was purchased “half in Bitcoin and half in US dollars,” and that the seller didn’t know that the transaction involved cryptocurrency.

“The day of the closing was faster than a wire transfer—they converted the Bitcoin immediately into dollars,” says Denison. The cryptocurrency has a reputation for being “somewhat shady,” Denison adds, but the transaction followed all legal protocols, including the buyer providing a passport to verify his identity.

The firm has nine Bitcoin “miners” in its offices, more as a way to “understand” the cryptocurrency, says Denison, than make sizable profits. The company also has a merchant account which provides the ability to buy cryptocurrencies with debit or credit cards.

“I think we’re the only firm that makes an effort to accept crypto,” says Denison. “Our closing department has been trained in that. We also opened an office in Hong Kong to make it easy for the client to put down deposits in Euros. It’s all about meeting the client where they’re at.”

Since 2016, Denison Yachting has sold three yachts and funded three yacht charters using cryptocurrency. Bob Denison expects buying boats in cryptocurrency to remain a “niche” part of his business going forward, but he believes, among cryptos, Bitcoin will be around. “It is volatile, but it seems to have staying power,” he says.

The Lagoon 52 had an asking price of $839,000 at the time of the sale.",2020-11-23 14:15:00+00:00

Bitcoin has surged by almost 40% in November and is up about 160% this year. It reached a peak of just under $20,000 in December 2017, before crashing spectacularly, losing a quarter of its value in a single day.

Analysts and investors say the coronavirus pandemic has led to a reassessment of bitcoin’s value as an alternative currency, and even as an alternative to gold. As the US dollar and other currencies have weakened, more investors are turning to cryptocurrency as protection against inflation.

Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, said last Friday that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, were “here to stay”. He said millennials were happily embracing new technologies – although he himself has not bought much bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

“But do I think it is a durable mechanism that could replace gold to a large extent? Yeah I do, because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box.

PayPal has launched a crypto trading service on its platform, and has reportedly bought nearly 70% of all new bitcoin in circulation. Its chief executive, Dan Schulman, said the pandemic had accelerated the shift to digital forms of payments.

A number of hedge fund managers, including the US billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, who predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash, have revealed in recent months that they have invested in bitcoin. Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corp, has been recommending the cryptocurrency to his clients as a hedge against inflation, with the US Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates at zero. Congress has resumed its negotiations over a massive stimulus package for the US economy.

Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and other digital currencies have also regained popularity in recent months, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and XRP, as investors reviewed their long-term prospects.",2020-11-24 00:00:00,https://inc42.com/buzz/cryptocurrency-this-week-behind-the-scenes-of-the-bitcoin-bull-run/,"According to Monark Modi, founder and CEO of Bitex, the Bitcoin bull run is being caused due to increasing investment from institutional investors, investment banks and more importantly payment companies.

Another reason for the Bitcoin bull run was the third halving for the cryptocurrency in May this year

According to Sumit Gupta, cofounder and CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange CoinDCX, the Bitcoin bull run can be primarily attributed to the cryptocurrency being the preferred choice for new investors and having strong fundamentals

The Bitcoin bull run is real! It has now stretched on for 112 days, according to industry watchers. But unlike the stock market, where the fluctuations in prices of stocks are directly influenced by events happening around the world, the reasons for a cryptocurrency’s bull run aren’t easily decipherable.

This is because cryptocurrencies operate independently of the traditional financial system. Hence, events that shape the day for the stock market seldom affect the price of cryptocurrencies.

According to Sumit Gupta, cofounder and CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange CoinDCX, the Bitcoin bull run can be primarily attributed to the cryptocurrency being the preferred choice for new investors and having strong fundamentals.

Besides, known giants in the payments space such as PayPal and Mastercard also launched crypto offerings for their humungous userbase this year, thus enabling easy access to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for those with a sound knowledge of the product.

Another reason for the Bitcoin bull run was the third halving for the cryptocurrency. Gupta elaborated on the same.

“In May 2020, we also witnessed the third halving, a supply shock event that happens every four years, where the number of daily mined bitcoins gets cut in half. In the previous two halvings too, Bitcoin and the overall crypto market cap rose exponentially, and we are expecting a similar trend. This time around, we are witnessing interest not only from retail but institutional investors globally too,” he told Inc42.

Global crypto experts have also tied the Bitcoin bull run to the accumulation of bitcoins by whales i.e. individuals or entities who hold large amounts of the coin for long periods of time, hence playing a major role in price manipulation. In November, analysts have spotted whale clusters, which emerge when Bitcoin whales buy the cryptocurrency at a specific price point and don’t move them.

According to researchers at Santiment, an on-chain market analysis platform, the current number of Bitcoin whales with at least 10,000 coins is somewhere around 114.

According to Monark Modi, founder and CEO of Bitex, the UAE-headquartered crypto exchange which recently expanded its operations to India, the Bitcoin bull run is being caused due to increasing investment from institutional investors, investment banks and more importantly payment companies.

“Millennials are already considering Bitcoin as Digital Gold. The financial industry has been quite forthcoming in addressing this changing investment behaviour, be it global fintech like PayPal that has started accepting cryptocurrency on its platforms or an investment bank like JP Morgan Chase, which has adopted blockchain-based interbank payment systems through Stablecoins,” Modi told Inc42.

“Judging by this heightened interest towards cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has the potential to touch $22,000 by coming quarter,” he added.

While the Bitcoin bull run will no doubt attract new investors to the emerging digital asset class, which has given 130% returns this year as opposed to 30% on gold, its notorious price volatility remains a cause for concern for market watchers.

Although, Gupta of CoinDCX explained that the price volatility was directly related to the maturity of the Bitcoin technology.

“Five years ago, Bitcoin was way more volatile than it is today. However, with increased adoption and a growing market cap for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin will no doubt stabilise. I also expect the ongoing bull run to be more stable than the previous one in 2017,” he said.

It is worth noting that when there’s an upward movement in the price of Bitcoin, as there is currently, it positively affects the market sentiment towards other leading cryptocurrencies. For instance, Ethereum has also been witnessing an upward trend since the first quarter of the current financial year 2020-21. This is mainly because both Bitcoin and Ethereum have strong fundamentals

In fact, over the last week, while the price of Bitcoin has grown over 11% to $18,870, the price of Ethereum has grown 22% to $605.

Nevertheless, Vikram Rangala, chief marketing officer at Singapore-headquartered crypto exchange ZebPay offered a reality check, as well as an investment strategy for the ‘Bitcoin SIP’.

“No one can predict how far a rally can go, so short-term speculation is very risky. However, there is one smart investment strategy: cost averaging for the long term. Buy small amounts of Bitcoin daily or weekly, hold it long-term through the ups and downs, and stick to your buying plan for years, not months. It’s like an SIP for bitcoin,” he said.

“At some point, there is always a correction (fall) in price. Anyone who pretends to know more than this is fooling himself or others. Although, Bitcoin will continue to go up (with periodic corrections) and could easily hit INR 1 Cr by 2030, as our CEO (Rahul Pagidipati) has predicted. Investors should plan in years, not weeks.”

The Bitcoin bull run has also seen the leading cryptocurrency challenge gold as an asset class for millennials in India. Inc42 analysed the development, learning from some of the leading crypto exchanges in India about them seeing increased traction from young working professionals around the Diwali festive season when Indians consider it auspicious to buy gold.

Moreover, growing interest from global players such as Cashaa, Coinbase and Tim Draper-owned Draper Associates in the Indian crypto market, coupled with the Bitcoin bull run, could help crypto adoption in the country.

However, market sentiment for crypto in India could come crashing down, the next time speculations about an impending ban on cryptocurrencies in the country start doing the rounds.

Ultimately, the burgeoning industry will remain at the mercy of news speculations and a confusing regulatory scenario for cryptocurrencies in India, until the Indian government chooses to regulate digital assets.

According to Crebaco Global Inc, a credit rating and complete audit firm for the blockchain and crypto industry, the Indian crypto industry has a potential market size of $12.9 Bn, if the sector is regulated.

The price of Ripple's XRP gained as much as 70% in hugely volatile trade on Tuesday, extending the broader cryptocurrency rally led by Bitcoin.

As institutional investors allocate massive amounts to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, other market participants are looking to alternative cryptocurrencies — or altcoins.

Ripple designed XRP to perform speedy, less costly, and more scalable alternative transactions.

The token's latest rally is also being driven by a central bank push to digitalize currencies.

Ripple's XRP surged as much as 70% on Tuesday as the third-biggest cryptocurrency extended a rally that has been kickstarted by mass interest in Bitcoin.

Ripple's price has risen about four-fold since the start of the pandemic, making gains alongside Bitcoin — which rose 4% to a near all-time high of $19,241 on Tuesday.

""XRP has been a speculative investment for a long time,"" said Michael Anderson, co-founder of DeFi venture capitalist Framework Ventures. ""There have been many partnerships announced but few practical applications.""

The top cryptocurrencies have gained price momentum over the last week. Ethereum has gained 30% and Bitcoin by 8%, but XRP has led the way with a 70% jump. Bitcoin's rally this year has been partly driven by its touted status as an inflation hedge, which in turn could be spreading to other cryptocurrencies.

Investors pouring into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other cryptos are looking to capitalize on a central bank rush to digitalize currencies, specifically the European Commission. ECB president Christine Lagarde has previously said the bank is seriously considering a digital euro.

The name ""Ripple"" plays a dual role as both a payments exchange and a currency. Ripple designed XRP with the chief aim to perform speedy, inexpensive, and more scalable alternative transactions that make it ""extremely useful"" for payments.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has risen above $600 this week to a two-year high head of a major update to its network to address scalability and security. The platform's network upgrade will usher in new decentralized finance products that create high-demand alternatives to traditional finance, which explains the rapid increases in valuation, Anderson said.

As for Bitcoin, any rush past $20,000 and profit-taking that comes after ""isn't a bad thing, it is healthy for the market to push on further,"" according to Rich Rosenblum, head of trading at crypto market maker GSR.

""It will clear the way for more investors with long-term outlooks to enter for the first time, and for existing holders to add to their allocations. There is still a lot of capacity among retail and institutional investors, this price action is arguably the first step of a bull market that is ready for new levels of capital not seen in digital assets,"" Rosenblum said.

JPMorgan analysts say institutions are piling into bitcoin. And the IRS has again sent out (possibly erroneous) letters to crypto traders indicating they owe taxes on unrealized gains.

Top shelf

Taxman knocketh

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is again sending mixed messages related to crypto trading and tax reporting obligations. Allegedly, “dozens of individuals” have received CP2000 letters detailing how much the IRS believes traders owe – based on gains from unreported crypto holdings in 2018, according to CryptoTrader.tax. However, as in years prior, it’s possible these traders never realized these gains and don’t owe anything. The issue may stem from how crypto exchanges report transactions to the IRS, using form 1099-K, which shows all transactions as generating revenue. Exchanges could prevent this issue by sending 1099-B reports to the IRS, which accurately mark gains and losses, TaxBit co-founder Austin Woodward told CoinDesk last time around, in March.

Institutional analysis

JPMorgan analysts say institutions are piling into bitcoin at a stronger pace this quarter than they were in Q3, according to the banking giant’s “Flows & Liquidity” report. Published Friday, the analyst report compares institutional to retail buying. For instance, Q3, retail customers bought $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin using Square’s Cash App, nearly three times more than what was invested in Grayscale’s bitcoin product. Though in Q4, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is at three times its Q3 numbers. To be sure, Square has yet to post numbers related to customers’ Q4 bitcoin buys. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is wholly owned by Digital Currency Group.)

Gold bug to BTC ‘cockroach’

Pendal Group, an Australian Securities Exchange-listed investment manager with over A$100 billion (US$73.6 billion) in assets under management, is getting into bitcoin. Vimal Gor, Pendal’s head of bond, income and defensive strategies, said Monday the company is now investing in bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As quoted by the Australian Financial Review, Gor thinks not only is bitcoin “entering the realm of mainstream,” as shown by the entrance of major hedge fund managers, but that “bitcoin is a cockroach that exists. They can’t ban it out of existence.” Pendal also reportedly aims to position BTC for their clients, as it previously has done with gold.

Crypto… currency?

In case you missed it, PayPal’s CEO Dan Schulman is bullish on bitcoin as an actual currency. Luckily for him, PayPal will soon allow its network of merchants to accept bitcoin payments. Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday, Schulman said bitcoin’s usefulness as a currency will co-exist with its buy-and-hold status. The CEO also said a central bank digital currency is a global inevitability, though that could bolster bitcoin’s utility. “I think that there’ll be more and more use cases for cryptocurrencies” that make bitcoin more widely accepted, more stable and probably “more valuable” over time.

E-money license

Crypto.com is trying to bulk up its Maltese financial licenses in search of a competitive edge across Europe. The Hong Kong-based crypto firm received preliminary approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) for two financial licenses that govern how payment companies operate and what services they can provide. Crypto.com could soon start offering payment services and issue e-money as a licensed financial institution with MFSA oversight. It could additionally execute, custody and deal in-house with customers’ crypto assets as one of the first-ever holders of a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets license from Malta.

Market intel

Powder keg

Bitcoin hurdled past $19,000 on Tuesday, with momentum to potentially reach its all-time high of $19,783 set on Dec. 17, 2017. Bitcoin broke the $17,000 level and then $18,000 level within the same week, and has rallied $7,000 in one month. The market capitalization of bitcoin also hit its all time high this week to about $329 billion, according to data provided by crypto analytic firm CryptoQuant. With increased institutional investors entering the bitcoin market, the ease of retail buying from PayPal and Square (among other providers) as well as miners not liquidating their positions, “it appears likely that price will continue to rise,” according to a newsletter by CryptoQuant on Nov. 13.

Airdrops and inflows

XRP continues to rally, hitting a watermark of $0.79 early Tuesday, the highest since 2018. The world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is up 130% from lows near $0.30 seen on Saturday. Analysts say a recent airdrop of 45 billion “spark” tokens to XRP holders related to a forthcoming smart contract platform developed by Ripple’s investment arm could be driving the price. Still, as XRP surges, selling pressure mounts: as evidenced by nearly $1 billion in XRP flowing into exchanges, possibly for liquidation.

At stake

Deposit set

Yesterday morning (in the U.S. at least), Ethereum pundit Anthony Sassano tweeted that 307,392 ETH ($181 million) had been allocated to a smart contract that would kick off the first phase of Ethereum 2.0, in what’s shaping up to be the largest blockchain overhaul to date.

That was nearly 220,000 ETH shy of the total amount needed to get things rolling on schedule. Exactly 524,288 ETH (worth over $325 million) needed to be locked up in the so-called deposit contract to begin the next phase of development by Dec. 1.

Yesterday evening, that amount was matched, a significant feat of community commitment. Now begins the hard part.

Ethereum will undergo a transition in consensus model, from the proof-of-work system implemented in Bitcoin to the proof-of-stake mechanism thought to improve blockchain scalability. Eth 2.0 will also see the implementation of sharding, another cryptographic technique meant to improve transaction throughput.

While the launch of the actual Eth 2.0 network is a ways off, on Dec. 1 a parallel proof-of-stake blockchain dubbed “the Beacon chain” will go live. In this initial phase of development, the PoW Ethereum and Beacon chain will exist side-by-side.

Those that pledged funds to the deposit contract will be validators on this experimental network, and earn rewards for processing transactions and creating new blocks. CoinDesk is just one of many network validators.

One potential reason funding for the deposit contract came down to the wire is the staked ether is irretrievable in the short term, at least until Ethereum 2.0 development progresses to a significant degree.

Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at blockchain infrastructure service provider Bison Trails, said that while some users may be put off by the one-way nature of staking ETH in the contract, “by and large the community is extremely excited to launch Eth 2.0.”

The Beacon chain activation is the first of four phases of the Ethereum 2.0 migration, which begins with the onboarding of validators and eventually leads to the full transition of all users and dapps to the new network.

“There’s not a chance that Eth 2.0 doesn’t launch,” Bunin told CoinDesk. “Eth 2.0 is a vision. It is a drive to improve Ethereum to scale support for the entire planet. Even if this launch is not successful for some reason, you can be sure that the community will learn from it and try, and try, again.”

Crypto is abounding worldwide. In just over ten years, cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets have gone global, with 154 countries across the developed and developing world implementing the technology for their country’s various needs.

A variety of new altcoins have been added alongside crypto giants Bitcoin and Ethereum to allow for financial freedom outside of institutions, and to give more opportunity to unbanked populations worldwide.

Crypto is growing as an asset class as well, with more start-ups offering tokens to investors as an alternative to traditional financing. Crypto asset trading volume is on the rise as well. Additionally, blockchain technology is being implemented across an array of industries, providing secure and transparent solutions for finance, government, healthcare, and more.

And because crypto isn't confined to one country or region, we're seeing it flourish across the world in groundbreaking new applications. But the future of crypto innovation, adoption, and trade will be found in Asia.

Those in the Western world who may only be familiar with Bitcoin may be surprised to learn that 31% of all cryptocurrency transactions from mid-2019 to mid-2020 occurred in East Asia, totaling $107 billion — 77% more than Europe. There’s also wider investment across a number of crypto assets as well than are typically found in the West. Additionally, Asia is a crypto mining hub, containing over half the world’s hash rate.

A Brief Look at Asia’s Crypto Market

Asian countries are not only embracing crypto asset investment, but are applying unique applications of crypto and blockchain technology, with exciting opportunities for growth. Here are a few examples of why Asia will be a hub for crypto — and in many ways why it already is.

Utility Tokens over platforms: The South Korean market is an important testing ground for crypto use cases, especially since it's more focused on altcoin and utility token issuance. We'll see widespread adoption here, as, for example, over 30% of convenience stores accept crypto already. While Japan is more Bitcoin-driven, it’s turning more towards altcoins with recent Bitcoin caps in the market. There's a much younger investment culture in Asia who are more interested in actively trading than the Western approach to buying and holding (or HODLing). Additionally, US and European markets are still quite conservative around altcoins. Altcoins also provide unique opportunities for investing in new projects, as more start-ups issue ICOs — and new exchange listings are always popular for investors. Altcoins also show the region’s priority: A focus on building applications, not platforms.

Mobile first and digital adoption: Asia’s mobile-first region is comfortable with conducting nearly all aspects of everyday life on their phones, including making digital payments, paying bills, taking out loans, booking travel, accessing public services, paying rent, and more — things that the Western world isn't accustomed to doing yet or with such frequency. This creates the opportunity for a faster, more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and other crypto asset utilizations since the culture is already on board with digital technology of this kind.

Unbanked opportunities: There's great opportunity to use crypto for unbanked populations, which is where the Philippians focus is. Those who are unemployed or lost jobs because of COVID-19 are finding new income streams through a “Play to Earn” Dapp on the Ethereum blockchain.

Chinese commitment: The Chinese government has committed to blockchain as part of its five year plan. Still, while they maintain a ban on buying crypto, they've become the leader in building infrastructure for CBDC innovation, and are making plans for a national currency. China is also a major player in crypto mining, possessing 65% of the world's hash rate due to low electricity and labor costs and easy access to hardware.

Large crypto exchanges: Asia also has exchanges trading at very high volume, with a high frequency of rotating listings from new crypto projects. And while Japan has been more conservative in its exchange regulations, and while China only allows C2C trading, Asian exchanges are trading at a frequency of almost four times higher than North American exchanges.

Misconceptions Still Abound

Unfortunately, despite crypto’s growth, there are still misconceptions about the Asian markets, specifically that the investments are speculative and the companies are scams — especially the companies issuing altcoins. While crypto has seen its fair share of exit scams and volatile trading, the companies issuing these coins and tokens are largely serious projects with big dreams. Yet oftentimes investors want to see faster returns and quicker listings on exchanges, resulting in misaligned objectives with teams focused on long-term innovation. Obviously there's opportunity for improvement around better investor relations, visibility into start-up projects, and technology enhancements, but these growing pains shouldn't be seen as a barrier to investment.

Looking to the Future

With this kind of commitment to crypto, it's easy to see how Asia will be center stage for crypto innovation. Going forward, we're likely to see some of the following:

Markets and innovations focused much more on blockchain technology and crypto asset utilization.

Asia's financial activity shift to being based on crypto assets, like financial holdings and custody, lending, and trading.

A move to make small sized assets like patents, copyrights, or online reputations be turned into crypto assets, that can then be tokenized and traded publicly on the blockchain.

Passive income gained from crypto holdings move into the public.

A complete disruption of payment systems that will be replaced with crypto options.

A unification and standardization of markets and corporate funding, due to crypto’s borderless and decentralized nature.

Finally, keep an eye on Asia. It’ll be exciting to see how crypto will realize its many potentialities in that region in the years to come.

Bitcoin soared above $19,000 on Tuesday for the first time in nearly three years, bringing the cryptocurrency within spitting distance of its 2017 record.

The price of Bitcoin jumped as much as 3.3%, to $19,272.21, through the morning.

Cryptocurrencies have garnered new interest from both Wall Street and Main Street in recent weeks as companies and traditional investors embrace digital tokens.

The rally lifted other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Ripple.

Bitcoin jumped above $19,000 on Tuesday for the first time since 2017 as Wall Street and Main Street rekindled their interest in cryptocurrencies and extended the digital token's rally.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency surged as much as 3.3% through the morning to an intraday high of $19,272.21. The gains brought Bitcoin just a hair below its all-time high of $19,783 reached in December 2017.

Cryptocurrencies have garnered attention in recent weeks as companies and traditional investors accept their uses. Square bought $50 million worth of bitcoins in October, saying it sees potential for the token to become ""a more ubiquitous currency."" Soon after, PayPal announced it would soon let its users buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The news pushed Bitcoin above $13,000 and sparked speculation about whether the coin's latest rally had the legs to bring it to new highs.

Some of Wall Street's biggest names have also backed the rally. Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer, said Friday that Bitcoin was ""here to stay"" because of millennials' interest in digital payments. Stanley Druckenmiller said on November 9 that he had ""warmed up to the fact that bitcoin could be an asset class that has a lot of attraction.""

Others are skeptical about the run. Ray Dalio said last week that he ""might be missing something about bitcoin,"" adding that its volatility diminishes its use as a store of wealth and a medium of exchange.

Even if Bitcoin maintains its lofty value, it can't replace central-bank currencies, because governments are likely to ban the token ""and make it too dangerous to use,"" Dalio tweeted.

The Tuesday surge lifted other popular cryptocurrencies. Ether gained as much as 4.3%, to $622.73. XRP spiked 54.7%, to $0.79, at intraday highs.

Bitcoin traded at $19,235.79 at 8:25 a.m. ET, up 166% year-to-date.

But the licenses are only granted in principle for now. Crypto.com Chief Executive Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk they will become full licenses once the company satisfies a set of MFSA conditions. He refused to elaborate on what those conditions are or when they will be met.

Assuming they are, Crypto.com could be well-positioned to deal across a continental bloc in the midst of expanding its crypto licensure regime. The European Commission recently proposed a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies called Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) that would impact the entire European Union.

State-level actions on crypto regulation have generally been harder to come by.

Bitcoin closed in on the $19,500 price point Wednesday, hitting as high as $19,474, according to CoinDesk 20 data, before losing momentum, down to $18,883 as of press time.

“Following a meteoric rise over the past week, bitcoin appears to have consolidated at $19,000 even after briefly dropping below this important psychological milestone,” noted Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro. “This is important because it shows there is support for bitcoin at this valuation for the first time in its history.”

“Bitcoin maintains itself above $19,000 so we’re about a 2% move away from approaching the all-time highs last seen in 2017,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “Every day we’re seeing volumes increase across venues.”

Helping to lead bitcoin’s price run is volume. In fact, Tuesday’s $1.8 billion in combined daily volume on five major USD/BTC spot exchanges (Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit and Kraken) is the second largest recorded in 2020, only superseded by March 13’s $1.9 billion level. As of press time, Wednesday’s volume for the five exchanges was approaching $1 billion.

“The last few weeks we’ve seen volumes rise aggressively and we don’t expect that to come off too much over the next few days,” noted Michael Rabkin, head of institutional sales for crypto market maker DV Chain. “From a price perspective, we believe there is a lot of momentum in this risk-on market and cannot see it coming to a halt anytime soon given all the money being printed globally.”

Indeed, the amount of M2 U.S. money stock jumped from $15 trillion in January to $19 trillion in November, a 26% increase of circulating money supply created this year in an effort to stave off coronavirus-inflicted economic problems.

And while many market observers talk about bitcoin’s proximity to an all-time price high, many are ignoring the impact ether has also had on the market. An impending upgrade of the network to Eth 2.0 plus an increase in decentralized finance, or DeFi, use cases seem to be fueling the ether fire. In 2020, bitcoin is up over 162% while ether has gained a whopping 343%.

Bitcoin could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2021, according to the crypto investor Anthony Pompliano.

Pompliano, a cofounder of Morgan Creek Digital, told CNBC on Wednesday that demand for Bitcoin was rapidly exceeding supply and that the macroeconomic environment of low interest rates was ""rocket fuel"" for the cryptocurrency's price.

""I don't think it's that crazy to see a $100,000 bitcoin price by the end of 2021,"" Pompliano said.

Watch Bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2021, according to the crypto investor Anthony Pompliano. The coin traded as high as $19,389 on Wednesday and is nearing its all-time high, reached in 2017.

Pompliano, a cofounder of Morgan Creek Digital, told CNBC on Wednesday that demand for the coin was rapidly outpacing supply, especially after its ""halving"" in May, when the number of bitcoins awarded to miners was cut in half. This occurs roughly every four years and serves to limit the supply of bitcoin coming into the market.

Bitcoin is ""the winner of a supply-and-demand exercise,"" Pompliano said.

Pompliano added that the macroeconomic environment right now was ""rocket fuel"" for Bitcoin. Low interest rates, money printing, and the Federal Reserve's average inflation target of 2% have driven retail and institutional investors into Bitcoin, he said.

The investor also said that Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's pick for treasury secretary, was ""notorious"" for tolerating higher levels of inflation and that this could also push the coin's price higher.

Bitcoin has surged by roughly 160% this year as more major investors and institutions acknowledge the cryptocurrency's legitimacy as a store of value. The billionaire hedge-fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC earlier this month that he owned a ""tiny bit"" of bitcoin as a hedge against inflationary pressure, while the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said in February that every citizen should hold 1% of their assets in bitcoin because it's a ""fantastic hedge.""

Despite his bullish view, Pompliano shared two potential risks he sees for Bitcoin.



""The first thing's a self-inflicted wound, right, if there's a bug introduced into the code or something like that,"" he said. ""The second thing would be some sort of geopolitical risk where we saw a really aggressive coordinated kind of action by multiple nation-states.

""But again, I think that those things are very low probability of occurring, so it doesn't really kind of seem like that's going to happen in the short term.""

Pompliano's Morgan Creek Digital is an investment firm that helps public pensions, university endowments, and private foundations invest in blockchain technology.

The Coinbase CEO took to Twitter Wednesday night to blast the U.S. Treasury Department’s rumored plans to attempt to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets with an onerous set of data-collection requirements.

If the whispers are to be believed, outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is preparing to tamp down on one of the fundamental tenets of the cryptocurrency ethos: the ability of the individual to hold his or her own crypto unmolested.

“This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet,” Armstrong tweeted.

If true, the regulation would represent a broadside against the U.S. cryptocurrency industry like few ever levied by the federal government. It would force corporations to know every counterparty to their users’ crypto transactions, keeping logs, tracking movements, and verifying identities even before a transfer could take place.

It would also bring to pass the worst-case scenario envisioned by industry players when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body, told its member countries to apply the so-called Travel Rule to crypto businesses last year. This long-standing rule requires financial institutions to collect information about the sender and receiver of a money transfer. But it was ambiguous what that would mean when someone sends bitcoin from, say, a Coinbase account to an address controlled by a private key on a sheet of paper kept in a sock drawer.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Widespread impact

And it would not just affect those who store their coins on a hardware device like Trezor or Ledger. Many crypto services use non-custodial wallets. Decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Software wallets, paper storage. All would need to prove their provenance to transact with regulated entities under the rumored rule.

Such a sweeping interpretation of FATF guidance has already been applied in Switzerland and the Netherlands. There, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must prove the ownership of non-custodial crypto wallets ahead of transfer.

Armstrong said Wednesday that such a regulation “would be a terrible legacy and have long-standing negative impacts for the U.S.”

“This additional friction would kill many of the emerging use cases for crypto. Crypto is not just money – it is digitizing every type of asset,” he said.

To date, regulation of decentralized cryptocurrency networks had been mostly limited to the on/off ramps between the networks and the traditional finance system, according to Jacob Farber, partner at blockchain law and consulting firm Ouroboros LLP.

This state of affairs left the industry “mostly unregulated” and private, such that it has been able to offer a real alternative to traditional finance, Farber said.

“Imposing a KYC [know-your-customer] requirement on transactions between on/off ramps and every wallet that transacts with them expands the reach of regulation over crypto exponentially,” Farber added. “More importantly, it changes what crypto can be, at least at scale.”

He called Armstrong’s concerns justified and said these potential regulations should be taken seriously by the cryptocurrency community.

Preemptive strikes?

Armstrong’s tweets appeared to break long-simmering industry fears over this kind of regulation into full public view.

In recent days, multiple cryptocurrency lobbyists and advocacy groups have staged what in hindsight appears to have been a soft influence campaign to shape public opinion of non-custodial wallets.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is disabling its margin trading product in order to comply with the new rules set by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

CFTC’s Rules Affecting Margin Trading Offerings

Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, explained in a blog post on Tuesday:

In response to new guidance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we are disabling our margin trading product.

Starting on Wednesday, Nov. 25 at 2 p.m. PT, customers currently using Coinbase’s margin trading will not be able to place new margin trades and all open limit orders will be canceled, Grewal detailed. “The product will be taken offline in December once all existing margin positions have expired.”

The chief legal officer further explained that Coinbase believes “clear, common sense regulations for margin lending products are needed to protect” U.S customers, adding that the company “look forward to working closely with regulators to achieve this goal.”

Coinbase began offering margin trading to customers several years ago but discontinued the service after it was investigated by the CFTC following an ethereum flash crash. However, the company rolled out margin trading on Coinbase Pro this year for customers residing in 23 U.S. states, its website details.

While Coinbase did not specify which specific CFTC rules it is trying to comply with, the derivatives regulator published the “Final Interpretive Guidance on Actual Delivery for Digital Assets” in March. Similar rules were used in the CFTC’s enforcement action against Bitfinex back in 2016.

On social media, crypto users are concerned that other exchanges could follow Coinbase and disable their margin trading products. Investor Adam Cochran commented: “Huge blow to US crypto and likely to drive price impact as it will take a lot of money off the table. Wonder how long before other US exchanges are forced to comply.”

The article said Ratcliffe’s letter represented “a push by President Trump’s spy chief to convince the SEC to implement rules that make it easier for U.S.-owned cryptocurrency companies to compete against those based in and controlled by China.”

It also speculated “it is possible” that President Trump’s executive order this month prohibiting any U.S. businesses or citizens doing business with any company linked to the People’s Liberation Army “could apply to Chinese-linked digital currency companies.”

The Examiner, owned by right-wing billionaire Philip Anshutz, said a “senior intelligence official” told it “[t]here are serious national security concerns about China’s control over Bitcoin and Ether… Digital currency controlled by the CCP could certainly fall into that category, but the bottom line is that we cannot allow China to dominate the technologies and innovations that are going to decide who runs the world for decades to come — from artificial intelligence to digital currency, and everything in between.”

It added that Ratcliffe’s letter attached a letter written this summer by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) arguing that the SEC should “develop a clearer articulation of policy and, ultimately, formal Commission guidance addressing digital currencies” in order to give U.S. companies the opportunity to lead the cryptocurrency industry. The Examiner added that Cotton’s letter said “the continued lack of regulatory clarity not only hurts U.S.-developed digital assets, it puts American national and economic security gravely at risk.”

The Ratcliffe letter noted President Xi Jinping’s push to dominate blockchain technology and to launch a central bank digital currency, the digital yuan, before any other major country. The country sees the digital yuan as a way of undermining the U.S. dollar’s economically powerful place as the world’s reserve currency—a role British Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has also suggested as a benefit of CBDCs.

Regulatory clarity needed

Ratcliffe’s quote can be seen as the Trump Administration signaling to whoever President-elect Joe Biden picks to head the SEC that the issue of China’s potential control over cryptocurrencies—particularly bitcoin and ether— ought to be viewed as a threat to American financial technologies.

Noting that by some estimates as much as 65% of cryptocurrency mining takes place in China, executives of Ripple—including executive chairman of the board Chris Larsen, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and general counsel Stu Alderoty, who the examiner quoted—have been particularly vocal on this issue.

On Oct 14, Garlinghouse told Fox News that the lack of U.S. regulatory clarity over cryptocurrencies is giving an “advantage [to] Chinese technology at the disadvantage to a company like Ripple and others like Ripple,” adding that it is “a really frustrating place to be.”

In August, Alderoty told Modern Consensus “there’s a real national economic and national security issue and this goes to the Chinese control of Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

He said “if you look at the Chinese control [of] Bitcoin and Ethereum, I think that’s part of their probably now decade-long attempt to displace the US dollar as the global currency… Add to that the billions of dollars in mining rewards going to Chinese miners… you end up in a world where China can effectively displace the US dollar. They can potentially evade U.S. sanctions and money laundering controls.”

Alderoty also criticized the SEC’s lack of regulatory action on whether cryptocurrencies other than BTC and ETH are not securities, saying the position companies like Ripple “find ourselves in the U.S., oddly enough, is that the SEC, the only two digital assets that the SEC has put their good housekeeping stamp of approval on by declaring them non-securities are the two Chinese-controlled assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. So that’s a real problem.”

Having senior intelligence officials echo precisely those points can be seen as a way of signaling to the Biden Administration—which promised in its campaign to be more engaged but also tougher on China than the Trump Administration—that American cryptocurrency companies ought to be given, if not an advantage, then at least an level playing field by their own country’s regulators.

Ratcliffe’s letter can also be read as an embrace of American crypto companies which have been working with regulators on know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance as they seek to push the SEC towards a more positive view of the cryptocurrency industry that will give it a leg up rather than a hand tied behind its back.",2020-11-25 15:27:58+00:00,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/20/11/18539881/bitcoin-ethereum-zilliqa-american-wrap-11252020,"It seems that Bitcoin has decisively decoupled from gold for the first time in years as the correlation coefficient is dropping fast.

Bitcoin fell by over 10% on Thursday as cryptocurrency traders cashed in on holdings whose values have gained 20% this month alone.

The digital token looked set to hit a record high of $20,000 this week.

Traders said that after such a swift rally, several large investors booked profits on their holdings, many of which may have been moved to exchanges to secure a better price.

""It feels more and more like we're hitting a Bitcoin tipping point,"" a crypto trader said. ""In fact, a cooldown is to be expected.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Bitcoin slid by more than $2,000 on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in nearly three months.

The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency had fallen by 11%, to $16,725, as of 8:45 a.m. GMT. The price is still up by about 21% this month and by 138% on the year. It hit a peak of $19,497 on Wednesday but did not break the record of $19,666 set in December 2017.

The price correction may also be a function of crypto traders moving larger volumes of bitcoin to exchanges — where they can be more easily sold at a better price — when the token approached $20,000.

""It feels more and more like we're hitting a Bitcoin tipping point,"" said John Kramer, a trader at the crypto trading firm GSR. ""In fact, a cooldown is to be expected. But with more well-known fund managers and institutions re-examining their Bitcoin theses every day, it's getting harder to not take the asset more seriously.""

Kramer said many investors feel that the stock market is utterly divorced from economic reality right now. The S&P 500 hit record highs this week as US COVID-19 cases surged and as many as 2,200 Americans were dying every day from the virus. Prospective returns from traditional markets are low, while the risks are quite high, he said.

Part of the rally in cryptocurrencies in the past few weeks has stemmed from the fact that they — unlike equities, bonds, gold, or oil — have very little correlation to the economy, interest rates, or even other asset classes.

""The stimulus response to the pandemic has stoked lingering concerns among several large asset managers about the devaluation of the US dollar, shining a light on Bitcoin's finite supply,"" Kramer said. ""The risk-return relationship for digital assets is now uniquely poised as an attractive alternative that is uncorrelated to wider macro and increases the diversification of a traditional portfolio.""

Despite the sell-off on Thursday, Bitcoin may soon hit $20,000, said Ki Young Ju, the creator of CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm.

""All Exchanges Inflow Mean increased a few hours ago,"" he said in a tweet. ""It indicates that whales, relatively speaking, deposited $BTC to exchanges. But long-term on-chain indicators say the buying pressure prevails. I still think we can break 20k in a few days.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said on Thursday its retail and professional-focused platforms were hit by tech problems, with users reporting difficulty trading as bitcoin plunged towards its biggest one-day drop since September.

California-based Coinbase said on its website at 14:14 GMT it was investigating connectivity problems, adding at 14:42 GMT that it had identified the problem and implemented a solution.

In a separate post at 15:21 GMT on its Coinbase Pro site it said “increased latencies impacting order entry and settlement” for its Coinbase Pro service, adding it was investigating the problem.

A spokesman for Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, declined to comment.

Coinbase users on Twitter reported problems trading.

One Coinbase Pro user told Reuters by message: “The outage prevented me from submitting a buy limit order which would’ve been executed as the limit price was met. At this time the order finally went through but I missed the price for now.”

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, slumped as much as 13% on Thursday to its lowest since Nov. 16., slamming the brakes on its red-hot rally and sparking a sell-off of smaller coins.

It was last down 9% at $16,904 and on course for its biggest one-day drop since Sept 3. The move represents a sharp correction from its three-year high of its near-record $19,521 hit on Wednesday.",2020-11-26 16:17:10+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-crypto-prices-drop-fast-bitcoin-loses-2k-correction-considered-healthy/,"Market Update: Crypto Prices Drop Fast, Bitcoin Loses $2K, Correction Considered Healthy

The price of bitcoin and a great number of digital assets plunged in value during the early morning trading sessions on November 26, 2020. Bitcoin’s price dropped from a high of $19,319 on Wednesday evening only to lose over $2,000 during the course of the morning hours (EST) on Thursday morning.

Cryptocurrency markets have shed enormous value on Thursday, November 26, 2020. The entire market cap of all 7,700+ digital assets has lost over 5% in value and rests just below the $500 billion mark. ($498B)

BTC prices touched a high on Wednesday evening at $19,319 per unit and slid to a $16,870 low during the early morning trading sessions on Thursday. The price has increased since the bottom on Thursday and so far, BTC has shed 10.9% in USD value. The price of BTC is currently swapping for $17,277 per unit.

Out of precisely 7,784 cryptocurrencies worldwide across 33,471 markets, there’s roughly $291 billion in global trade volume. Out of the entire crypto-economy, the Bitcoin Dominance Index is hovering around 62% on Thursday dropping 2.5% since the recent price high.

The second-largest crypto-asset ethereum (ETH) has lost over 12% so far and each ether is swapping for $522 per coin. Ethereum has a market cap of around $59 billion at the time of publication.

Significant drops in cryptocurrency values across a myriad of markets are not unusual on November 26, as the occurrence has taken place every year for the last three years in a row.

Bitcoin cash has shed considerable value losing 18.5% during the last 24 hours. At the time of publication, bitcoin cash (BCH) has an overall market cap of $5.18 billion on Thursday.

The cofounder of Definer, the defi network for digital loans, savings and payments, Chyna Qu explained this week that crypto use cases continue to grow stronger. “The true price indicator is the technology behind Bitcoin, and use cases are constantly growing. We predict that bitcoin will peak at the end of this year at around $40,000.”

While most people have been upset about the recent crypto-economy dump a number of people said the correction was due many days ago. “This pullback is healthy,” Heidi Chakos (@blockchainchick) tweeted on Thursday.

One hour later, at approximately 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $17k range to $16,318. BTC has lost another 2.2% since this market update was published at 9 a.m. in the morning on Thursday.

Key Takeaways CEO of Coinbase expressed concerns over a forthcoming U.S. law planned by the Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin.

The new law would impose KYC verifications for self-hosted wallets and smart contracts.

Apprehension around the regulations is putting negative pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Share this article

The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, shared details of an alleged proposal from the U.S. Department of Treasury, which experts think “could be an existential threat to Bitcoin.”

More Surveillance of Bitcoin Users

The outgoing Trump administration is planning to implement a mandatory KYC rule for self-hosted Bitcoin wallets.

Self-hosted wallets include open-source crypto wallets like Bitcoin Core and Metamask and extend to DeFi, hardware devices, and paper wallets. Armstrong elaborated in the Twitter thread:

“This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet.”

In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued new guidelines for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which require crypto businesses to obtain users’ personal information before they can send and receive digital assets.

Compliance with KYC and AML rules on Bitcoin on-ramps and exchanges are widely implemented across the industry. The governments have forced many crypto exchanges to make KYC mandatory for registration. Thus, have access to transaction details of the exchange users.

However, self-hosted Bitcoin wallets that have remained anonymous make it difficult to enforce the latest travel rule. Moreover, over 500,000 Bitcoin has moved off exchanges this year, making it difficult for authorities to keep track.

The regulators clearly demand more adherence to the FATF guidelines by requiring information about all crypto wallets, not just platforms like Coinbase.

The Netherlands has already implemented a similar rule citing precedence with their Sanction Act of 1970.

Regulatory Concern Pauses Bull Rull

Crypto Twitter expressed strong concerns about the gravity of the situation. If implemented, it would hamper privacy and prevent any degree of anonymity of a person’s Bitcoin wealth.

Angel Investor, Balaji Srinivasan, called for resistance to the proposal. He said:

“The proposed new anti-crypto regulation by [Steven Mnuchin] is a form of financial disenfranchisement. It harms people who lack ID, further expands the surveillance regime, and sets up more honeypots for hackers. It must be resisted vigorously.”

The move is also seen as the leading cause of Bitcoin’s price drop this morning. Nevertheless, Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder of Circle, wrote:

“Market reaction to regulatory engagement around open blockchain access is overblown — there are smart, engaged people in Treasury who want to work with the industry to address risks while preserving open networks and innovation.”

Bitcoin led the industry’s losses with a 13.09% drop to lows of $16,320. It is currently changing hands at $16,884.21.

In brief Bitcoin was set to break its all-time high yesterday, but instead, the price crashed overnight.

Industry pundits gave several reasons for this, including Bitcoin being overbought in recent months.

The re-opening of withdrawals on OKEx may have also played a role in Bitcoin's price crash.

The Bitcoin market crashed overnight, with the price of Bitcoin dropping by 11% in the last 24 hours.

Over the last few months, the Bitcoin market has been on a major bull run. Bitcoin’s price increased from $12,900 on October 24, 2020, to over $19,000 just one month later, making people think a new all-time high record was just around the corner. But now, the numbers are going in the wrong direction.

""Today’s drop seems to be a temporary correction from the $20,000 price level and was likely caused by the fear, uncertainty and doubt created by today’s news,” Igor Runets, founder and CEO of BitRiver, a company that provides solutions for large scale mining, told Decrypt.

Fear, uncertainty and doubt have been cited as causes for the market crash elsewhere, mostly due to the psychological barrier of the $20,000 mark.

“The all-time high is a major psychological barrier—breaking it requires real momentum,” Jason Deane, Bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, who provide cryptocurrency and economic analysis, told Decrypt. Deane added that the “rejection was taken as a sell signal by traders looking to profit, leading to lower price and the reverse of the effect we’ve just seen until it equalizes and has another go.”

Another reason for Bitcoin’s price crash might be that Bitcoin was being chronically overbought. In other words, buyers were getting greedy. “This is usually classed at an overbought signal, which often precedes a correction,” Deane added.

While fear and overbuying have played a role in Bitcoin’s price crash, OKEx—one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world—might have also played a role.

“Given the timing, the move down is likely to have been accelerated by the resumption of OKEx withdrawals,” Sui Chung, CEO of cryptocurrency indices provider CF Benchmarks, told Decrypt.

This October, OKEx suspended all withdrawals after the exchange founder was taken away by the police. Today, withdrawals have resumed, following reports that Mingxing Xu was released. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price rallied as OKEx withdrawals were suspended, and crashed soon after OKEx resumed normal business.

OKEx withdrawals may have played a role in Bitcoin's recent price crash. Image: Shutterstock

“Most of the frozen Bitcoin had traded up around 70%, so there were a lot of unrealized profits locked up there,” Chung said, adding that, “Once these coins were free to move it’s likely many traders sold them for dollars and stablecoins to realize those gains, adding greater momentum to the selling.”

Despite the plethora of reasons for the price crash, Bitcoin might just be experiencing a temporary drop off.

Bitcoin analysts still optimistic

Bitcoin’s price may have dropped significantly in the last day, but industry experts hope that the price will rally once more.

“With a little more time to consolidate, Bitcoin’s exchange rate will go much higher,” Runets added.

What’s more, some Bitcoin watchers suspect this price drop won’t mirror the market crash seen in 2017, arguing that Bitcoin is in a better place now than it was three years ago.

“While the all-time high price of Bitcoin reached in 2017 has not been surpassed, the total market capitalization of Bitcoin is much higher as there are significantly more Bitcoin in circulation than ever before.” Gunnar Jaerv, COO of First Digital Trust, a Hong Kong-based digital asset custody provider, said.

In addition, Deane suggested that while the “bottom could be as low as $14,000 to $15,000, I don’t think it would go lower at this stage.”

However, others in the industry think this price crash is only natural. “I think this selloff is healthy for the market which has been overheated and very optimistic for some time,” said Soravis Srinawakoon, CEO and co-founder of cross-chain data oracle platform Band Protocol, adding that, “As we saw in 2017, nothing can go up in a straight line.”

Bitcoin most certainly isn’t.",2020-11-26 13:39:41,https://news.sky.com/story/bitcoin-hopes-of-record-value-of-over-20-000-dashed-after-cryptocurrency-falls-again-12142786,"Bitcoin fell 8.7% on Wednesday - just as it neared its highest-ever price - passing $19,000 (£14,241) for the first time since its 2017 collapse.

It was joined by other cryptocurrencies in the drop, all of which had been buoyed in recent weeks by strong demand from institutional investors.

Despite the losses, Bitcoin - which remains the most valuable and popular digital currency - has increased its value by more than 100% this year.

Some hedge fund managers have suggested it could hit $100,000 (£75,000) in 2021.

Brian Estes, a chief investment manager at Off The Chain Capital, said: ""I have seen Bitcoin go up 10x, 20x, 30x in a year. So going up 5x is not a big deal.""

Kevin Muir, a trader based in Canada, said: ""Any hedge fund model on Bitcoin is rubbish. You can't model a mania. Is it plausible? For sure. It's a mania. But does anyone actually have a clue? Not a chance.""

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently said he was ""very nervous"" about people using Bitcoin to make payments.

He has also warned that people who invest in the cryptocurrency should be prepared to ""lose all their money"".

The highly volatile digital asset set a record high of $20,089 (£15,062) in December 2017.

However, in the year that followed its value plummeted more than 80% to $3,200 (£2,400).

A Sky News investigation found the fall led to businesses collapsing, marriages failing, and some investors defaulting on their mortgages.

Bitcoin was billed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system when it was unveiled in a white paper in 2008, not long after the financial crash.

The document was written by a person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but their identity remains unknown.

Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins that will gradually be released between now and 2140, and fractions of them can be traded.

Some have suggested this capped supply has contributed to recent rises as central banks turn to quantitative easing in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which effectively involves printing new money.

Acknowledging the growing interest in this “relatively new tool,” Mishustin said the government plans to lead the cryptocurrency market’s development in a “civilized direction” so users can better can protect their “rights and interests.” This would make it more difficult for fraudulent “shadow schemes” to operate, he said.

The prime minister explained that Russia’s tax code will be amended to designate crypto assets as property, meaning owners will be able to seek relief in court if they should fall victim to any illegal activity.

The country’s Ministry of Finance has already suggested a range of additions to the tax code, including the obligation to report crypto holdings starting from a certain threshold, as well as legal consequences for those who don’t.

Mishustin was appointed the head of the Russian government this spring, after leading the country’s federal tax agency for 10 years.",2020-11-26 12:25:30+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/millennial-crypto-victory-bigger-price-220015328.html,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With the speed cryptocurrency is emerging as the Millennial generation’s alternative asset of choice in India, it’s hard to imagine that just two years ago a couple of blockchain pioneers were briefly in police custody.

Sathvik Vishwanath and Harish BV, cofounders of a then five-year-old startup, were arrested in late 2018. No, they hadn’t pulled off a shady initial coin offering. Their “crime” was that they put up a kiosk in a mall in Bangalore where customers could swap Bitcoin, Ether or Ripple for cash or vice versa. That was the whole point of Unocoin, their crypto token exchange. But the police were suspicious of the new-fangled “ATM.”

A lot has changed since then. Unocoin, which just raised financing from Tesla Inc.-backer Tim Draper’s Draper Associates, is flourishing, together with other Indian blockchain ventures. India’s share of person-to-person virtual-currency trading in Asia has surged to 33%, the same as in China, according to Oslo-based Arcane Research’s analysis of volumes on Paxful and LocalBitcoins, the biggest platforms for transactions in the region.

Some of this is no doubt due to the bubbly rise this year in Bitcoin, which recently came within $100 of its all-time high after surpassing $19,000 for the first time since 2017. Even after Thursday’s wobble, prices have still more than doubled this year.But fundamental factors are also at play. Sending money to India in a tokenized form, and thus avoiding hefty bank charges, is becoming an option. Some customers of digital-asset exchanges, probably tech-savvy freelancers, receive tokens at regular intervals as payment for their work and convert them into rupees via their local bank accounts. Families in India are using the same channel to send money to students overseas.

Having the world’s largest diaspora — and more than $100 billion in two-way money flows last year — isn’t the only thing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s disastrous ban on 86% of the country’s currency in November 2016 shook Indians’ faith in fiat money. Add the fear of leaving spare cash in banks when three major deposit-taking institutions have crumbled in the past 15 months. No wonder Arcane expects Indian crypto volumes to overtake China’s.

Story continues

The domestic asset management industry is also helping adoption of crypto — by its incompetence. Most large-cap fund managers have struggled to beat their benchmarks, especially in recent years. The Nifty 50 index has returned only about 2% annually in dollar terms over the past decade. Yet, as Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gaurav Patankar and Morgan Barna have shown, lack of performance hasn’t kept managers from pocketing high fees.

Disgruntled younger savers are taking note, and dipping their toes in U.S. exchange-traded funds. At 1%, international allocation is still tiny, the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say, but it’s growing rapidly. Ditto for crypto-investing, even though holding a highly volatile digital asset over the long term isn’t for the faint of heart. Only 600 of Unocoin’s 1.2 million customers have started a systematic buying plan to invest (mostly) in Bitcoin. But 99.5% of them are sitting on profit, and must be bragging about it to their friends.

There’s one dampener: regulation. Nobody wants a return to 2018, when the Reserve Bank, the monetary authority, instructed banks not to entertain customers who dealt in virtual currency. The draconian approach nearly strangled India’s blockchain revolution. The action against Unocoin’s kiosk in Bangalore was like the heavy hand of the state crashing down on a kids’ lemonade stand. If folks in India’s technology capital couldn’t pay cash to buy digital tokens, then the asset was effectively being banned nationwide.

In hindsight, the founders’ ordeal with the police proved to be a blessing in disguise. Young entrepreneurs joined together, went to the Supreme Court in New Delhi and got the RBI’s direction to banks declared unconstitutional. That was in March. Already, the exchange has seen a fivefold jump in trading, averaging $150,000 a day, from $30,000 before the court’s verdict. Of late, trading is much higher, thanks to the rally in Bitcoin prices. Larger bourses such as CoinDCX were witnessing daily volumes of almost $700,000, when I last checked.

The players are urging the government to bring digital assets under the existing money-laundering law, which will give the industry legitimacy. The next step would be to regulate the tokens as money or securities, depending on their use. Read About: The End of Banking as We Know It

India’s phlegmatic bureaucracy may wonder if this is all a craze. Perhaps not. It isn’t even unique to Indian Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Wringing the global banking industry dry of its exorbitant fees, and putting more purchasing power in people's hands after the Covid-19 pandemic, will be a worldwide goal. In their study titled, “What We Must Do to Rebuild,” Deutsche Bank AG economists are advising companies and policy makers to design alternatives to credit cards and “remove middleman fees.” In the short run, conventional fintech will help, but in the longer term, major economies will all do this by replacing cash with their own central bank digital currencies.

That’s when older consumers will join in. If they don’t, they’ll get get stuck, and not just figuratively. Automatically triggered crypto “smart contracts“ will make it possible for self-driving cars to switch lanes faster than others. Commuters will be continuously paying one another in official digital currencies — or in stablecoins like Facebook Inc.’s proposed Libra, private tokens whose values are fixed against fiat money.

The Indian Millennials have read the tea leaves right.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were struck by heavy losses on Thursday morning as the hopes of reaching record highs were quickly diminished after months of impressive performances.

Bitcoin fell more than 15% from its high of $19,521 on Wednesday to a low of $16,391 on Thursday.

The BTCetc Bitcoin Exchange Traded Cryptocurrency (BTCE) fell 7.3% on Thursday in tandem with the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC) falling 11.6%.

This was one of the biggest daily drops since the beginning of September for the digital asset when it fell 10% in the space of 24 hours.

The reason for the sharp drop is threefold, according to crypto exchange Coindesk. Excess leverage, technical pullback and other factors amplified sell-off.

The exchange said that the recent rally looked 'overstretched' and therefore the pullback was likely to happen as it usually does in previous bull markets.

Investors were hopeful that the valuation would surpass its previous record value of $20,000 seen in December 2017. Since mid-March, bitcoin had rocketed 263% from its lowest price of $5,165.

Ripple and ethereum also suffered heavy losses over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, falling 35% and 18.6%, respectively.

The crypto ETP market had been booming as a result of the price rallies prior to Thursday as 21Shares reached $150m assets under management while BTCE surpassed $160m on Wednesday.

On 18 November, BTCE saw record trading volume for a single day of over two million units worth $36m.

ETP provider CoinShares said bitcoin is only just emerging as a store of value and volatility is to be expected, therefore the recent price movements are not a surprise.

Aside from investors taking profit, recent comments by the US Treasury are also a likely catalyst for this sell-off as it highlights bitcoin’s sensitivity to regulation, and that as it matures as a store of value, it will garner regulatory scrutiny, according to the issuer.

""We feel this is likely a short term flush-out,"" added Frank Spiteri, chief revenue officer at CoinShares. ""Skew reports that aggregated open interest on bitcoin futures hit all-time highs of $7.4bn on 24 November.""

""This has since come down to about $6.1bn, but still remains higher than the previous all-time high of $5.7bn in late August, so still at elevated levels.""",2020-11-27 11:01:14,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-and-safety-money-bitcoin-vault-breaks-stereotypes/,"Cryptocurrency and Safety Money, Bitcoin Vault Breaks Stereotypes

Cryptocurrency theft has boomed over the past couple of years and this is no hoax. Over USD 1.40 billion was stolen in the first five months of 2020. If thefts continue to rise at this rate, 2020 may well become the second-costliest year in the history of crypto – lagging slightly behind last year’s record of USD 4.5 billion.

Hackers Continue To Outpace Defenders

According to CipherTrace, although cryptocurrency developers, wallets, and exchanges are working hard on strengthening their defenses, hackers continue to outpace them with their innovative tricks and tactics.

Take what happened with Binance, the world’s largest exchange, back in May 2018. Over USD 40 million worth of crypto assets were stolen by hackers who used a lethal cocktail of phishing, viruses, and other attack vectors. The hackers were able to get in and out with the digital assets in a matter of minutes before anyone could put a finger on what was going on. And this is usually the case!

These transactions happen so quickly that the assets are long gone even before anyone guesses that they may no longer be sitting on the handsome pile they had just a couple of moments ago.

Although this is what the general trend has been like in the past, one cryptocurrency, BTCV (Bitcoin Vault), has been able to produce a security solution that not only slows down transactions but also allows users to reverse them.

A New Concept

Till now, the one problem many crypto users were facing was that they did not have time or the tools to nip the attack in the bud. As decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data that has been entered cannot be erased or reversed. Any transaction made on the blockchain is permanent and viewable to anyone.

After studying this loophole in the system and the nature of the attacks, BTCV developers started working on ways to enhance the safety features of the coin. And, after an entire year of research and development, BTCV was able to launch its 3-Key Security Solution.

Powered by three private keys, this security solution gives users time to react to an attack. It also provides them with the tool and authority to cancel any unauthorized transaction within the 24-hour window, which was previously impossible to do.

A Promising Future

The use of the three-key technology promises mass adoption, as it solves the problem of losses to theft. In recent years, individuals have lost vast amounts of wealth because their devices were lost or stolen and transactions were executed. In other cases, plain carelessness has led to the loss of funds where the sender executes a transaction that contains an incorrect address.

Many people have been hesitant to join the cryptocurrency world because they dread the fact that there is no possibility to reverse or cancel transactions that have been initiate. This is a luxury they enjoy only with the traditional banking system.

Bitcoin Vault is the coin of choice for people with doubts emanating from the irreversibility of cryptocurrency transactions. Both the sender and the recipient are at ease when they know that fund transfers can be cancelled.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin took a 17% nosedive and now sits within a narrow trading range.

Meanwhile, Ethereum retraced to a crucial support level that will determine where its price is headed next.

A significant spike in stablecoins exchange inflow suggests that some investors are preparing to re-enter the market.

Share this article

Roughly $2 billion in long positions have been liquidated during the most recent correction in the cryptocurrency market. On-chain analysis now shows that investors may not have to wait long to make up their losses.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are already showing signs of a potential rebound.

Bitcoin Consolidates Before Next Major Move

The flagship cryptocurrency took a 17% nosedive after rising to a new yearly high of nearly $19,500 on Nov. 25. Since then, prices have been consolidating within a narrow trading range without providing a clear path for where they are headed next.

The lackluster price action seen in the past few days forced the Bollinger bands to squeeze on the 1-hour chart, indicating that a major price movement is underway.

Some of the most prominent technical analysts in the industry view squeezes as stagnation periods that are usually succeeded by high volatility.

The longer the squeeze, the more violent the breakout that follows.

Given the lack of direction for Bitcoin’s trend, the area between the lower and upper bands can be considered a reasonable no-trade zone. Only a candlestick close above or below any of these critical hurdles will determine whether or not the pioneer cryptocurrency is poised to recover lost ground.

Slicing through the overhead resistance at $17,420 would likely be followed by a spike in buy orders behind Bitcoin. The potential increase in demand could have the strength to push prices back above $18,000.

As a matter of fact, one of the most significant resistance barriers ahead of BTC sits at $18,350.

Conversely, if sell orders begin to pile up around the current price levels, Bitcoin might break below the underlying support at $16,500.

Turning this demand wall level into resistance will likely result in further losses.

A downswing below this price point may trigger panic selling among investors, pushing prices down to $15,350 or even $13,500.

Ethereum to Rebound But Faces Stiff Resistance

The $475 resistance level has capped Ethereum’s price action since early September.

But on Nov. 20, the buying pressure behind Ether was significant enough to allow it to finally break through this hurdle and rise more than 30%, pushing prices to a new yearly high of $620.

From a technical perspective, the upswing was correlated with the breakout of an ascending triangle developed on ETH’s 1-day chart for the last three months. A horizontal resistance wall formed along with the swing-highs, while a rising trendline was created along with the swing-lows.

The distance between the widest point of the triangle projected a target of $730.

Now that Ethereum retested the breakout point at $475, it could be poised for another leg up to reach the triangle’s target.

Such a bullish thesis holds when looking at Santiment’s holder distribution chart.

The behavioral analytics firm recorded a spike in buying pressure as prices were collapsing. This market behavior indicates that some investors took advantage of the downward price action to “buy the dip.”

Indeed, the number of addresses holding 100,000 to 1 million ETH shot up in the past 24 hours. Roughly four new whales also joined the network, representing a 2.6% increase in a short period.

When considering that these large investors hold between $51 million and $510 million in Ether, the sudden spike in buying pressure can translate into millions of dollars.

Ethereum may thus have the ability to rebound towards higher highs if whales continue loading up.

Regardless of the bullish outlook, IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model reveals a major supply barrier that may prevent the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap from achieving its upside potential.

Based on this on-chain metric, the area between $523 and $570 is filled by more than 1 million addresses that had previously purchased over 13 million ETH. Such a massive supply wall has the ability to absorb some of the buying pressure seen recently.

But if Ethereum can slice through this hurdle, it would likely climb towards $730.

On the flip side, the IOMAP cohorts show that the $475 support level may not be able to contain another sell-off.

Only 1.3 million addresses bought roughly 1.6 million ETH around this price level, making it weak support compared to the overhead resistance.

Slicing through this hurdle will likely jeopardize the optimistic scenario and lead to further losses.

Investors Prepare to “Buy the Dip”

On-chain data shows a close relationship between the exchange inflow of stablecoins and Bitcoin’s price action. Numerous times throughout the past year, a spike in the number of stablecoins transferred to known exchange wallets was followed by a bullish impulse.

Dino Ibisbegovic, content and SEO manager at Santiment, maintains that when stablecoins begin to flood exchanges, it is indicative of an increase in “buy the dip” sentiment.

“I reported on this phenomenon back in May following Bitcoin’s +10% pump, and once again earlier this month, on the back of BTC’s +16.9% week. In both cases, I noted that Bitcoin’s bounceback seems to occur when stablecoin whales and/or retail owners start offloading their stablecoin bags – and especially if there’s a corresponding spike in the inflow of stablecoins to exchanges,” said Ibisbegovic.

Recently, Santiment recorded a major uptick in the number of stablecoins sent to known exchange wallets during the correction.

More than 720 million USDT, 230 million DAI, 85 million BUSD, and 317 million USDC were transferred to exchanges.

Given the recent market behavior, it is very likely that sidelined investors are taking advantage of the low prices to re-enter the market.

For this reason, it is imperative to pay close attention to the support and resistance levels previously mentioned.

If Bitcoin and Ethereum manage to break their respective resistance barriers, a further advance will be almost guaranteed.

Nouriel Roubini, known as ""Dr. Doom"" for his bearish views, slammed Bitcoin for being heavily manipulated and blamed retail investor FOMO for this week's boom and bust on Thursday.

Roubini tweeted the digital token has no role to play in the portfolios of retail or institutional investors because it has zero intrinsic value.

""Retail suckers with massive FOMO have been jumping again into BTC as they did in late 2017 when price went from 10K to 19K only to crash down to 3K in 2019,"" he said.

According to him, investing in Bitcoin is the same as gambling at a rigged casino.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nouriel Roubini, an economist nicknamed ""Dr Doom"" for his pessimistic predictions, trashed the world's most popular digital currency for being heavily manipulated in a series of tweets on Thanksgiving Day.

Bitcoin has risen 167% this year, hitting a record of $19,293 this week. But its price tumbled by more than $3,000 after large volume crypto investors cashed in on their holdings.

While crypto bulls have largely talked up its potential as a safe-haven asset, Roubini argued that it has ""no role"" to play in institutional or retail investor portfolios because it isn't a currency, unit of account, or a scalable means of payment.

""Retail suckers with massive FOMO have been jumping again into BTC as they did in late 2017 when price went from 10K to 19K only to crash down to 3K in 2019. Only winners were the manipulative whales that dumped their BTC to the retail suckers & led to its 85% price fall,"" he went on.

Compared to stocks, bonds, real estate, and other income-generating assets, he said there's no intrinsic value to be found in Bitcoin.

Roubini said crypto exchanges were also riddled with questionable trading practices, such as ""pump and dump"" - where traders over-inflate the value of a security the hold in order to aggressively sell it later - and inputting fake trades or prices.

In addition to high volatility — often at the hands of a small number of traders — the cryptocurrency market has been plagued with scandal. Major exchange Bitfinex was accused of draining client money to cover almost a billion dollars in missing cash last year, while top executives at rival platform BitMEX were charged with breaking anti-money laundering rules.

Continuing his scathing attack against the digital token, he said: ""It has no intrinsic value, it is not backed by any asset, it is not legal tender, it cannot be used to pay taxes."" He also raised an environmental argument against the power of POS, or proof of stake, that comes with being able to mine more bitcoins because it consumes immense amounts energy.

Roubini said Bitcoin is not an inflationary hedge because every time stocks go down, the digital asset falls much more.

@Nouriel/Twitter

He also equated investing in Bitcoin with gambling at a rigged casino. ""At least in legit Las Vegas casinos, odds aren't stacked against you, as those gambling markets aren't manipulated the way BTC is,"" he tweeted.

He concluded his 12-tweet-thread by saying ""stay away from the cesspool of 1000s of worthless sh*tcoins.""

Key Takeaways Facebook-led Libra will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin in early 2021.

The original Libra Coin was pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, which faced a massive backlash from regulators.

Share this article

After facing lengthy backlash from regulators worldwide, a pared-down version of Facebook’s Libra project will finally launch in January 2021.

Zuckerberg’s Libra Takes Flight

According to the initial white paper, Libra Coin was described as a coin pegged to a composite of multiple fiat currencies: US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Singapore dollar (SGD).

The idea of multi-currency stablecoin did not sit well with the regulators, who vehemently opposed the project, calling it a threat to global financial security.

Conceding to regulators, the team renewed its whitepaper by adding stablecoins denominated in single fiat currencies. According to a report from Financial Times, the January Libra launch consists of a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar (USD).

Independent crypto journalist, David Gerard, told Crypto Briefing:



“This is even more cut down than the Libra 2.0 plan from April. So, this is basically Paypal-but-by-Facebook, with US dollars. But if they still do it as crypto-coins backed by a reserve, there’s the same issues with the size of the reserve, if it’s at Facebook scale.”

Libra’s USD-pegged stablecoin is the first of what will soon be many single fiat-based coins to be launched in the future.

Facebook will be the first large technology company to issue USD-based stablecoin. Besides Facebook, many cryptocurrency exchanges and financial companies have issued USD-based stablecoins in the past.

The social media giant introduced the project in June 2019 and outlined its vision for a global multi-currency Libra Coin (≋LBR) for its 2.7 billion users.

The project is governed by the Libra Association, a consortium of private companies led by Facebook and headquartered in Switzerland.

The team has not yet confirmed the roll-out of the USD stablecoin. The Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, has approved the launch.

The TokenInsight market report states that the cryptocurrency market has become well-known for its unpredictable nature, high volatility levels, and potential cases of market manipulation.

The report from TokenInsight pointed out that BTC may have dropped by $3,000, but its price has increased significantly this year.

The report noted:

“Because of the sharp [BTC] price drop, the trading volume of the derivatives market has increased from $38.3 billion on 21st Nov. to $66.9 billion on 27th Nov. The price drop has also caused the massive liquidation of traders. Open interest dropped from $6.3 billion on 25th Nov. to $4.9 billion on 26th Nov.”

The report added that crypto and blockchain industry participants have different opinions about why the Bitcoin price fell sharply. It also mentioned this is “the second time of deleveraging this year after the Black Thursday in March 2020.” According to TokenInsight, the markets might have been affected after the statement from Coinbase that it would suspend all margin trading on the trading platform after reviewing the recent guidance from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The report further noted that on November 24, 2020, the threshold to launch the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet was reached, with almost 80% of the required 524,000 ETH having been committed (staked) into the ETH2 deposit contract. As confirmed in other reports, the launch of Ethereum 2.0 is officially set for December 1, 2020.

The TokenInsight team pointed out that the Ethereum price surged to around $620 after the threshold was reached, which boosted market emotions to a “crazy” level. The total ETH trading volume on that day had surpassed Bitcoin’s (BTC) trading volume by around 2.5x. The ETH-USDT pairs’ volume reached almost $3 billion in just one day, the report confirmed.

But the Ethereum price fell sharply and its down almost 25% from its recent high above $600. The digital asset’s price has been fluctuating quite rapidly. According to the report, Ethereum 2.0’s voting may have “a direct relation to the shock.”

There was also substantial perpetual contracts trading volume when Ethereum 2.0’s launch had been confirmed, the report revealed. When compared with trading activity from last week, the ETH perpetual contract volumes surged 14%, hitting $83 billion for the week and reaching a single day high of $18.3 billion.

During this past week, the price of XRP reached a two-year high.

XRP notably surged 50% in only 2 days with around 2.3 billion XRP (appr. $1 billion) flowing into the digital asset exchanges since November 21, 2020, the report noted. This is reportedly 3x last year’s average inflows, according to data from Chainalysis.

But the price of XRP surged to as high as $0.79 on November 24, only to crash by as much as 30%, to $0.51 almost immediately after, the report noted.",2020-11-16 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-launch/,"Facebook's Libra Crypto Gets Ready to Launch in January as a Single Coin

Facebook’s libra cryptocurrency is reportedly preparing to launch with a single cryptocurrency, a scaled-down version of its original plan. The launch date for Facebook’s libra could be as early as January.

Launch Date for Facebook’s Libra

The cryptocurrency libra, proposed by social media giant Facebook, is reportedly preparing to launch as early as January next year. However, only a limited version of the libra cryptocurrency will launch at that time.

According to the revised libra whitepaper, the Libra Association intended to initially launch with some of the currencies in the proposed libra basket, such as “librausd or ≋USD, libraeur or ≋EUR, libragbp or ≋GBP, librasgd or ≋SGD),” the association explained. However, the Financial Times reported Friday:

The association would now initially just launch a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar … The other currencies and the composite would be rolled out at a later point.

The exact launch date for the libra crypto would depend on when the project receives approval to operate as a payments service from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Three people familiar with the matter told the publication that it could come as early as January. Libra’s application was initiated in May.

Facebook unveiled the libra project in June last year and later scaled down its plans after being scrutinized by regulators worldwide. The Libra Association has 27 members currently, including Facebook’s David Marcus, who is Head of Facebook’s subsidiary Novi Financial, formerly Calibra. According to Facebook, “The first product Novi Financial will introduce is the Novi digital wallet designed for Libra, a new payment system which is built on innovative blockchain technology.”

The announcement adds that among the cryptocurrencies accepted at Pizza Hut are bitcoin, ethereum, dash, litecoin, binance coin, tether, DAI, and Cryptobuyer’s native token, XPT. It further adds that Pizza Hut restaurants are located in Caracas, Maracay, Maracaibo, and Barquisimeto. There are three locations in Caracas — in El Sambil, El Recreo, Líder, Caurimare, and las Mercedes.

In June, Cryptobuyer announced that Venezuelans will be able to pay for goods and services with cryptocurrencies in more than 20,000 stores throughout the country. This is made possible through the integration of “Cyptobuyer Pay” into Mega Soft’s “Merchant Server” platform. Mega Soft is a large payment processor in Venezuela, with an average of 18 million transactions processed per month.

Cryptobuyer previously explained that stores using Merchant Server have the ability to accept over 100 cryptocurrencies due to the company’s alliance with the Japanese crypto exchange Liquid.

Merchants can choose to either automatically settle their cryptocurrency payments in fiat currencies or keep the coins stored in their accounts. Among stores that are currently using Cryptobuyer Pay are Burger King, Intercontinental Hotel, and Traki, the largest department store chain in Venezuela.

Among other things, cryptocurrency is also fintech, financial technology. With bitcoin (BTC) hitting its highest ever market capitalization in November, the financial part of this combination has received plenty of attention in recent months, but what about the technology part?

While they don’t quite make as many headlines as price rises (and falls), developers associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and other major platforms have been quietly working on upgrades throughout much of 2020, and their work is likely to become more prominent next year. According to industry figures and developers speaking with Cryptonews.com, these developers will build on growing interest in crypto by introducing new tech that aims to make crypto more accessible and usable for a wider user base.

From Ethereum 2.0 to Bitcoin’s Schnorr and Taproot, much of the focus will be on scalability and, to a lesser extent, privacy. At the same time, other platform upgrades — such as Cardano (ADA)’s Goguen — will improve on decentralization and also enterprise-level utility.

2020: What was predicted last year

Rewind to late 2019, and experts predicted something similar for 2020: greater scalability and a growth in “consumer crypto platforms” which simplify user experiences for retail investors.

2020 did indeed promise and work towards greater scalability, but, speaking of major platforms, we didn’t see as much in the way of finished products, platforms or upgrades.

For instance, Ethereum 2.0 received plenty of hype and attention, but its mainnet still hasn’t officially launched (after numerous delays), and is now estimated to arrive in 2021. Likewise, the long-awaited Schnorr and Taproot proposals were in fact merged into Bitcoin Core on October 15, but they have yet to be activated, although support among miners is growing steadily.

That said, we did see an uptick in cryptocurrency platforms geared more towards the ‘average’ consumer. Most notably, PayPal launched its cryptocurrency service in October, as did UK-based financial app Revolut.

2021: Scalability and privacy for real this time

Having delays to scalability and privacy tech in 2020 makes predicting 2021’s technology trends pretty easy, since we can hope on held-back upgrades finally being launched next year.

This means Ethereum 2.0, if it’s launched, will see Ethereum vastly improve its scalability by moving to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

“The move to proof-of-stake and sharding should allow the network to overcome its current scalability issues and high gas fees, especially in times where there is congestion on the network. It will also lower the barriers to participation and secure the network, thus making it arguably more decentralised than its current state,” said Simon Peters, eToro’s resident cryptocurrency analyst.

2021 might also finally see Taproot and Schnorr signatures — which improve Bitcoin’s privacy and increase the amount of transaction info that can be included in a single block — being activated, adopted and widely used as part of Bitcoin.

“I think the main topic and development focus in 2021 will be Schnorr and Taproot adoption that is coming to Bitcoin. This will mean a lot of benefits and also a lot of work for software and hardware wallet companies,” said developer Stepan Snigirev.

Snigirev also told Cryptonews.com that the adoption of Taproot and Schnorr will facilitate a number of other technology innovations for Bitcoin.

“Lightning will become indistinguishable from normal single-key transactions,” he added. “Multisig and MuSig will be embedded in Taproot and also indistinguishable from other transactions.”

Put simply, technological developments in Bitcoin should enhance the privacy and scalability of its network, making it more usable in the process. But this focus won’t be particular only to Bitcoin, but will be a general trend throughout crypto in 2021.

“We also expect Litecoin (LTC) will launch Mimblewimble to offer opt-in privacy capabilities, which will also be a significant change,” said Jacob Illum, the Chief Scientist at Chainalysis.

Mimblewimble will improve Litecoin’s scalability and privacy, while another platform aiming to scale in 2021 will be NEO.

“We know that NEO 3.0 is close. We will certainly see it in 2021. It is hugely ambitious, and if it succeeds, we'll see the first massively scalable blockchain with sub-second block finality. This is very important for bank-grade transactions,” said Mark Jeffrey, the CEO of GuardianCircle.

Usability and user experience is more important

But while Jeffrey acknowledges that scalability is important, he estimates that the main focus in 2021 will be on improving user experience.

“There are too many people scaling and not enough users,” he said. “User experiences will be the focus of 2021. More than anything, this is what we have to solve for first.”

ConsenSys’ Chief Marketing Officer and Global Fintech Co-Head Lex Sokolin also suspects that enhancing user experience will be a big aim as far as technology is concerned.

“We expect continued growth in both decentralized finance (DeFi) on the public chain, as well as on the enterprise side in financial services and global trade. Within DeFi, simplified and improved user experiences, like MetaMask, will drive further adoption and usage,” he told Cryptonews.com.

According to Csilla Zsigri, an analyst at 451 Research, usability will be particularly important in terms of making blockchains and platforms more useful for enterprises.

“We see vendor activity in the enterprise blockchain/distributed ledger technology space intensify up the stack — on top of core ledger protocols — to improve different aspects of the technology such as interoperability and usability, to ultimately make it more consumable for both developers and the average user.”

Sokolin agrees that improving technology for the benefit of enterprises will become increasingly important next year.

“Potentially the BSN (Blockchain Service Network) and DCEP (China's digital yuan) are worth tracking as a platform that could have a meaningful impact on our space, and integrate increasingly more applications. The BSN connects into Ethereum, as well as other programmable chains [e.g. [URL=""https://cryptonews.com/coins/tezos/""]Tezos[/URL], EOS; NEO], and also the enterprise offerings of the Chinese fintechs like Alibaba,” he said.

More decentralized decentralization

Cryptocurrency is famed for offering a decentralized form of money, and 2021 will see various platforms concentrate on making their networks more decentralized.

“Having successfully completed their own major upgrade earlier this year, the Cardano network is now more decentralised. Development is underway for the next phase, Goguen, which is due to be released in March 2021 and will allow developers to build decentralized applications and run smart contracts on Cardano,” said Simon Peters.

Likewise, 2021 might see the launch of IOTA (MIOTA) 2.0, which will remove the centralized coordinator node that currently oversees consensus on the network.

“The IOTA team is currently working on a major protocol upgrade – IOTA 2.0 (aka 'Coordicide') – scheduled for 2021, using a three-phased approach: Pollen, Nectar and Honey releases,” said Csilla Zsgiri. “Pollen and Nectar are testnets for testing and validating the new concepts of IOTA 2.0, while Honey will be the first version of the production-ready decentralized IOTA mainnet.”

Price and development

There’s one last question to consider: would any potential price surges in 2021 increase the impetus for technological development?

Opinion on this question is divided, with Jacob Illum expecting that there may be an indirect relationship between the two.

“I think the price rise will drive attention and adoption, which in turn will lead to technological upgrades to Bitcoin,” he said.

However, Stepan Snigirev isn’t so sure, and thinks Bitcoin development will continue at the same pace regardless of whether 2021 brings a massive bull (or bear) market for bitcoin.

“Development activity is not correlated with the price, so I think we will just keep working on stuff as usual.”

Crypto Regulation in 2021: The Piecemeal Approach & New Winds

Crypto Adoption in 2021: Bitcoin Rules, Ethereum Grows & Faces Rivals",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/169639-coinbase-ceo-expresses-concerns-about-potential-new-regulations-for-self-hosted-crypto-wallets/,"Brian Armstrong, Co-founder and CEO at Coinbase, the leading US-based digital asset exchange, notes that this past week, the company heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin had been planning to “rush out” some new regulations for self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets – which would be before the end of his term.

Armstrong says that he’s concerned that this could potentially have “unintended” side effects, which is why he decided to share these potential issues via social media.

Last week we heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin were planning to rush out some new regulation regarding self-hosted crypto wallets before the end of his term. I’m concerned that this would have unintended side effects, and wanted to share those concerns. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 25, 2020

Armstrong explained that self-hosted digital currency wallets (also referred to as non-custodial wallets or self-custody wallets) are basically a type of software program that allows individuals and organizations to store and use their own virtual currency, instead of having to depend on a third-party financial institution.

He also mentioned that self-hosted crypto-asset wallets serve an important function, as they allow individuals and companies to use this new technology to gain access to basic financial services – just like anyone can use a computer or smart device to access services on the Internet.

Armstrong further noted that the “open” nature of cryptocurrency is what “makes it a powerful tool for innovation, and it is what levels the playing field globally.” This openness and ease of accessibility is also what drives innovation, like we’ve seen with decentralized finance (DeFi), Armstrong argued. According to the Coinbase chief executive, the open nature of crypto-assets has “the potential to bring down the cost of financial services, and improve accessibility.”

Armstrong stated:

“This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet. This sounds like a reasonable idea on the surface, but it is a bad idea in practice because it is often impractical to collect identifying information on a recipient in the cryptoeconomy.”

He also noted that many cryptocurrency users are sending funds to blockchain-enabled smart contracts in order to transact on DeFi apps. He clarified that a smart contract isn’t necessarily owned by any individual or organization that can be accurately identified. He claims that it’s a new type of recipient that “doesn’t have any direct equivalent in traditional financial services.”

Armstrong pointed out that many digital currency users send funds to different online merchants so they can buy goods and services.

He asks:

“Does it make sense to require customers to help verify the identity of a business before they can buy a product there?”

Armstrong further notes that many crypto users are also sending funds to individuals or businesses in emerging markets, where it’s quite challenging or not even possible in certain cases to gather meaningful KYC information. He also mentioned that some of these people in developing nations are living in poverty, and might not have permanent addresses or any official form of government-issued ID.

Armstrong pointed out that digital currency users are using their crypto with new types of apps online. He also noted that “imagine if every time you wanted to upvote some content on Reddit or transfer an item in a game you were hit with a form asking you to verify a recipient.”

He added:

“Many recipients (in the U.S. or abroad) who value their financial privacy, may simply not want to upload more identifying documents to various companies, which could be hacked or stolen. This additional friction would kill many of the emerging use cases for crypto. Crypto is not just money – it is digitizing every type of asset.”

He predicted:

“Given these barriers, we’re likely to see fewer transactions from crypto financial institutions to self-hosted wallets. This would effectively create a walled garden for crypto financial services in the U.S., cutting us off from innovation happening in the rest of the world. This would be bad for America because it would force U.S. consumers to use foreign unregulated crypto companies to get access to these services. And long term, I believe this would put America’s status as a financial hub at risk.”

He went on to mention that just like the U.S. had benefited from embracing the “open” Internet, it could also embrace the open cryptocurrency networks and let U.S. residents move their funds freely in the nascent cryptoeconomy.

Armstrong claims that if this crypto regulation is actually enforced, then it could be a “terrible legacy” and have “long-standing negative impacts” for the United States. During the early days of the Internet, there had been individuals who called for it to be monitored the same way that the phone companies were being regulated, Armstrong noted. He added that “thank goodness they didn’t.”

He confirmed that Coinbase has sent a letter to the Treasury, along with several other crypto firms and investors, articulating these concerns while also highlighting some other issues.",2020-11-16 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-institutions-suddenly-give-a-damn-about-bitcoin,"Without a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC) has become an increasingly popular asset to own among institutional investors. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, Fidelity reported in a survey of almost 800 institutional investors that 36% owned crypto assets. A separate survey, conducted by crypto asset insurance company Evertas, shared that respondents believe hedge funds will increase their crypto holdings drastically. It also projected that 90% of institutional holders of crypto assets expect to invest even more in Bitcoin this coming year.

From MicroStrategy and Grayscale to JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has solidified its place in investment portfolios as the asset to hold as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. However, beyond that, there are real technical reasons why institutional investors are becoming more and more bullish on Bitcoin, with some predicting it will reach $1 million by 2025.

Related: Time is our best friend: Bitcoin’s 12-month trajectory to $100K

While the future value of Bitcoin may continue to be a topic of debate, the reality is that investors and financial institutions now believe “holding BTC might prove to be less risky than not having Bitcoin exposure at all.” In fact, according to a crypto research firm Messari, more than 81,000 BTC belongs to “the treasuries of publicly traded companies.”

In total 81,154 BTC, or 0.5% of all BTC in circulation is held in the treasuries of publicly traded companies.

But, what spurred the Bitcoin rally of 2020, and what are institutional investors seeing in Bitcoin now that they didn’t see before?

Bitcoin’s borderless network and blockchain technology

Bitcoin acts as a non-sovereign currency that is uncorrelated with other asset classes. For institutional investors, it serves as a diversification tool to hedge against highly correlated markets such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the dollar. Two major areas where Bitcoin and blockchain technologies offer the most value to institutional investors include secure, borderless transactions and access to new opportunities that can’t exist in traditional financial markets.

Bitcoin’s innovative technology including smart contracts, borderless payments, lower fees and faster, more secure transactions are the catalyst that will prepare us for a future where national currencies break from their current physical form and become digitized.

Related: Bitcoin is the best treasury reserve asset humanity’s ever had

With U.S. dollar inflation on the horizon, notable investors like Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones are also beginning to “like Bitcoin more and more” and have identified it as the “best inflation hedge,” comparing it to gold and copper. As banks and technology providers continue to invest heavily in research and development projects related to verifying and recording finance transactions, such as JPMorgan’s new business blockchain and digital currency house Onyx, we will continue to see institutions increase their presence within the space.

The introduction of quality custody solutions

Custodians are used by financial institutions such as hedge funds and mutual funds, who are obliged to hold clients assets with a professional custodian for regulatory purposes.

Previously, institutional investors were wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to the regulatory environment, and until recently, the wider crypto ecosystem was also severely lacking in institutional-grade crypto asset custodial solutions. With an urgent need for adequate custodians to secure the growing amount of crypto assets and an increase in clarity around regulatory guidelines for operating and investing in cryptocurrencies, a sector of institutional-grade custodian solutions was born.

Anchorage, a newly-launched crypto custody firm backed by Andreessen Horowitz and a number of other prominent blockchain-focused venture capital firms, is one of those solutions. It was incorporated with the ethos to provide a crypto-native digital asset custodian for institutional investors. Bank Frick, a Liechtenstein-based private bank, has made it a priority to offer a range of blockchain banking services, including token launch support, crypto trading and digital asset custody. The regulated bank’s services are targeted at professional market participants and financial intermediaries in Europe.

Banks have also received the green light to custody crypto companies. In a note to the public, senior deputy comptroller and senior counsel of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould wrote back in July:

“We conclude a national bank may provide these cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers, including by holding the unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency.”

This marked a major industry-wide development allowing regulated financial institutions to hold the same safekeeping services previously exclusively held by specialist firms.

Banking custody options coupled with the emergence of crypto insurance companies like Paragon International Insurance Brokers, which was recently integrated into Bitstamps offerings, are providing policies for digital assets such as Bitcoin to be protected both online and offline while covering a number of crime-related circumstances.

The adopted regulatory and custodian solutions provide security for institutional investors who may have otherwise been skeptical. They are also helping hold cryptocurrency exchanges to a higher standard, encouraging them to protect investors’ money from theft or misappropriation. This has become an important catalyst for making digital assets more attractive to institutional investors and funds.

Institutional demand for Bitcoin

As the crypto market sees an uptick in institutional investments, with large purchases being completed by more and more firms, it has correlated into a rally in the markets.

According to a report from cryptocurrency derivatives platform Zubr, institutional investors are moving toward holding Bitcoin in “physical” form instead of cash-settled futures. The integration of institutional investors into the crypto ecosystem and their interest in holding is a positive sign for mainstream adoption. The similarities these investors share with holders indicate an easy transition from traditional finance to the digital economy, instilling trust in Bitcoin and representing an understanding and belief in the technology.

Serving both parties is also the high-potential upside that comes with decentralized finance, which has introduced a flow of new business streams, products and services. Services from the likes of Maker and Compound allow individuals to take out loans of any size in a matter of minutes without having to disclose their identity to a third party, while the yields associated with new DeFi products are resulting in gains that are higher than savings accounts, certificate of deposit accounts and other traditional options.

The potential benefits of the DeFi revolution are just one more reason the dynamic of cryptocurrency is shifting into what believers have wanted all along — a digitized, borderless asset.

The proof is in the numbers as institutional investors come for crypto

According to a recent survey by Fidelity Asset Management, 80% of surveyed institutions find investing in digital assets appealing, while the number of Bitcoin addresses has been steadily increasing. Addresses holding above 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins have also increased considerably. Coupled with declining balances on exchanges, this suggests that whales and larger investors are choosing to hold Bitcoin.

Additionally, a report by Big Four audit firm KPMG found that major banks, asset managers and qualified custodians are launching a new wave of institutional-grade crypto products and services. The institutional investments into cryptocurrency confirms trust in the digital asset from a significant place of power.

From around $7,000 on January 1, 2020 to around $17,000 on November 27, 2020, bitcoin has surged during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last two month, bitcoin has seen a steep rise – from $10,665 on September 25, 2020 to $19,028 on November 25, 2020 before falling to around $17,000 level.

But what makes people take the refuge in cryptocurrency during the pandemic?

“In the pandemic, many Indians have lost jobs, and this has led them to invest in cryptocurrency to earn side income. Moreover, a lot of new professions have emerged in this space – people are becoming traders, technical analysts, or crypto influencers. Many help their friends and family to invest in crypto because not everyone understands crypto. There are various crypto use cases that have emerged in India, and have affected Indians in a positive way,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO, WazirX.

“Increasing price of Bitcoin also creates a positive sentiment, and has pushed retail investors to jump in,” he added.

The latest surge pushed bitcoins close to the highest level of $19,783 that it achieved in late 2017.

But in case the rupee also depreciates, will the price of bitcoin see the shoot up from 2017?

“During the pandemic, a lot of money printing has happened globally leading to inflation. The stock markets have also been very shaky. People know that stock market conditions depend on companies which have, again, been affected by the pandemic. So people move their money to ensure that its value is more or less conserved in a deflationary asset like gold in the traditional system, or Bitcoin in the digital system. Bitcoin has a limited supply, and is seen as a store of value,” said Shetty.

Providing his opinion on whether investors should encash or hold their investments in cryptocurrencies in India at this high level, Shetty said, “What I’m seeing is, people are now taking notice of crypto. A lot of people who had bought crypto in 2017 at high rates, and held it it throughout, are getting activated, and everyone about what they should do – hold it or sell it. There’s confusion in the market, and we’ll know more when it stabilises a bit. In case of bitcoin, 60-70 per cent of investors hold it as a long-term investment, a small percentage of them holds it for medium term, and a very small percentage holds it for short term.”",2020-11-28 18:58:59+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/how-use-defi-crypto-exchange-uniswap-beginners-guide/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

You do not need to leave this window open for the transaction to continue. You can inspect it again in Metamask’s transaction history on a block explorer like Etherscan.

The fastest way to check your transaction is to click on your address in Uniswap’s toolbar (1) and then click on “View on Etherscan” (2).

5. Check Your Wallet

Once the transaction is complete, a new balance will show up in your Metamask wallet.

In this example, we traded ETH for DAI, which is shown at the bottom of the list as 115.348 DAI.

Part 2: Creating a Pool

1. Go to the Pool Page on Uniswap

As noted earlier, you can earn interest by depositing cryptocurrency in Uniswap’s liquidity pools. To do so, click on “Pool” in Uniswap’s main toolbar (1), then click on “Add Liquidity” (2).

2. Enter Pool Details

Enter the amount of cryptocurrency you want to deposit (1) and choose the coin you want to deposit (2). Then, choose a second coin for the other half of the trading pair you want to create (3).

In this example, we have created an ETH-to-DAI liquidity pool.

3. Approve the Transaction

Confirm the transaction in Metamask. You may need to reconnect your Metamask wallet if you have been offline for some time.

4. Wait For Your Deposit to Complete

Wait for Uniswap to approve your transaction. When other traders use your pool, you will earn interest. You can check the status of your pool on the Pool page.

If it does not show up, restore it by clicking on “Import” on Uniswap’s Pool page.

Part 3: Remove Your Stake

1. Go to the Pool Page on Uniswap

If you want to stop staking in a pool, you can withdraw your funds. First, go to the Pool page, find your pool, then click “Manage.”

Click “Remove” to proceed with the withdrawal. (Alternatively, you can add more funds to generate more income.)

2. Choose Withdrawal Amount

I know, this newsletter is for professional investors and not developers – why aren’t we talking about price? Don’t worry, we will further down. But things are evolving with Bitcoin technology that are worth keeping an eye on. While these changes have little to do with the short-term price movements, they are likely to play a significant role in bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

Two things happened this week to make this top of mind: a new development funding source was announced, and progress is being made on a particularly ambitious protocol upgrade.

Before we go into more detail about why these are significant, let’s look at why Bitcoin development matters.

Constant evolution

The idea of changes to the Bitcoin protocol will be surprising to many. I mean, doesn’t it just, you know, work? Isn’t one of its strengths that you can’t change the code? These highlight two misunderstandings about the technology and its potential.

Bitcoin’s code has been chugging along for over 10 years now, but it has undergone a few changes. In the early days, there were frequent bugs that Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and collaborators would fix. And old-timers will remember the “civil war” of 2017 around various scaling options that went to the heart of what the community wanted Bitcoin to be. The result was a change to the Bitcoin code to amplify block capacity, while dissenting opinions branched off to form a “new” Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin Cash.

There’s also steady work on functionality enhancements, such as enabling sidechains or smoothing information exchange. And compatibility issues and other minor bugs require constant attention. Like all technologies, if Bitcoin is not maintained and frequently updated, it will wither.

As for how changes happen, anyone can make changes to Bitcoin’s code – it’s open source. Getting the changes implemented, however, requires network consensus, and that is extremely difficult to achieve. Imagine trying to get 20 people with different philosophies, political convictions, economic incentives and life goals to agree on a simple change. Now, multiply that by hundreds if not thousands, make the changes complicated, and you get an inkling of how hard it would be to implement a meaningful alteration. This protects the network from any change other than those the majority believe are beneficial to the entire ecosystem.

Incentives matter

An important question is, who pays the developers that work on Bitcoin code?

In the early days of the Bitcoin network, almost all developer funding came from one source, the Bitcoin Foundation. Since then, other funders have entered the scene, including several companies dedicated to Bitcoin work, such as Blockstream, Chaincode Labs and Lightning Labs. Also involved are well-known crypto businesses such as Square Crypto, Coinbase, OKCoin, BitMEX and others, as well as not-for-profit organizations such as MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and the Human Rights Foundation. In addition, many developers work on Bitcoin for free, out of passion.

Diversity in the backers of Bitcoin development matters, as it ensures that the network cannot be influenced by one set of priorities. This is why the Brink initiative announced this week is significant: It pushes the diversity of Bitcoin development even further.

Brink introduces an intriguing funding model. It aims to channel donations to developers from a range of sources, including individuals, companies and not-for-profits. Its initial funding comes from donations from investor John Pfeffer and crypto custodian Xapo founder Wences Casares, as well as the Human Rights Foundation and crypto platforms Kraken, Gemini and Square Crypto.

This form of sponsorship could be appealing to individuals and companies that want to support Bitcoin development but don’t want to have to choose specific individuals to fund. The organization has applied for the charitable 501(c)(3) designation in the U.S. so donations can be tax-exempt.

Another big step is Brink’s focus on training new developers, to ensure a steady stream of qualified and diverse contributors well into the future. This bodes well for the network’s long-term resilience and growth.

Next upgrade

The second significant news item of the week highlighting the importance of the underlying technology concerns the Taproot upgrade, which will enhance the network’s smart contract functionality as well as introduce some privacy features. Bitcoin mining pools representing over 54% of the network’s current hashrate have signaled support. This is a strong step towards implementation (although there is yet some way to go – no change to the network is without controversy, no matter how popular the actual change is.)

This is significant not just because of the specific changes Taproot will introduce. It also shows that Bitcoin’s use cases are constantly evolving, and that itself is a value proposition. In other words, if you think Bitcoin is a powerful technology now, just wait.

As an example of how Taproot could influence bitcoin’s value, let’s look at what smart contract functionality means. Bitcoin’s program is relatively simple. It can do few things, but it does them well. Ethereum, on the other hand, is complex, but it can support the execution of a wide range of “smart contracts,” or decentralized applications.

While Bitcoin will never rival Ethereum in flexibility (nor does it want to – the more complex the program, the greater the potential attack surface), some modest improvements could improve its utility as a store of value. For instance, imagine that accountability of ownership could be programmed to enable bitcoin to be more effectively used as collateral.

They could also enhance its use as a medium of exchange. A proposed new type of verification signature could make layer 2 transactions easier and cheaper. Taproot also introduces some features that could encourage more use by masking the type of transaction (not its send/receive addresses), which would offer more privacy.

Looking ahead

While it is convenient to think of Bitcoin as a perpetual machine that just keeps running, we shouldn’t lose sight of the work involved in making that so. The more developers working on keeping Bitcoin clean and efficient, the more resilient the protocol, and the more likely it is that key improvements can be implemented carefully.

And the more diverse those developers are in terms of backgrounds and incentives, the less likely it becomes that Bitcoin could fall into the same trap as many of today’s technology networks: built by a few, for a few.

It’s also moving to see such a wide range of contributors involved in maintaining a “common good,” even though a direct path to profit is not clear. This is about more than open-source tinkering. It’s about building a new system that all involved believe is an answer to fundamental questions the world is just now waking up to.

Time to serve

This week U.S. President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate former Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen to head the U.S. Treasury, and may name former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler to become deputy treasury secretary, according to reports.

Treasury appointments are significant for the crypto industry in that the department could shape how some of the main U.S. financial regulators approach crypto assets.

Yellen has said in the past that she is not a fan of bitcoin (my colleague Nik De has summarized her views here) but supports blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation.

Gensler has demonstrated deeper expertise and enthusiasm. He testified before Congress about cryptocurrency and blockchain on multiple occasions, pushing back against comparisons with Ponzi schemes and declaring that the still-unlaunched libra token met the requirements of being a security under U.S. law. Late last year, he even wrote an op-ed for CoinDesk.

Gensler is currently heading up Biden’s financial oversight transition team, which also includes four other cryptocurrency and blockchain experts:

Chris Brummer is a law professor and the faculty director of Georgetown University’s Institute of International Economic Law, author/editor on a seminal book on cryptoassets, and host of the excellent Fintech Beat podcast. He also testified before the U.S. Congress regarding the libra project, and was nominated to serve as a commissioner on the CFTC under President Obama, although the nomination was reversed after the 2016 election.

Simon Johnson is an economist and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he supervised blockchain research and taught a course on the topic. He was part of the Congressional Budget Office’s Panel of Economic Advisers from April 2009 to April 2015. Johnson has also co-authored a paper about the extensive impact blockchain technology can have on the financial world, and served on CoinDesk’s advisory board, penning this op-ed in 2018.

Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of California at Irvine School of Law professor, specializes in banking law and also testified as an expert witness at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the impact of digital currencies on financial inclusion, and at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on regulatory frameworks.

Lev Menand, one of the original creators of the digital dollar concept, is an academic fellow and law professor at Columbia University. He served as a senior adviser to the deputy secretary of the treasury in 2015-16, has also worked as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s bank supervision group, and helped with a provision detailing the digital dollar in crisis relief bills from the House of Representatives drafted back in March.

Having stewards of U.S. currency regulation that are well-informed about cryptocurrency and blockchain is encouraging because it makes innovation-killing regulation less likely. Furthermore, official support for the exploration of new solutions to financial barriers, including blockchain-based assets, is likely to encourage both progress on regulatory clarity, and further investment in the crypto industry as a whole.

However, a statement from current U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offset the resulting market optimism, triggering concern that onerous rules might be pushed through from his office before the end of the year. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s recent book revealed that President Trump had instructed Mnuchin to “go after” bitcoin. And earlier this year, Mnuchin said that FinCEN, the nation’s financial crimes watchdog, was preparing to roll out some “significant new requirements” around cryptocurrencies.

So, some innovation-killing regulation may get rushed through before the transition. Crypto exchange Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted this week that he’d heard rumors Treasury was planning to rush out regulation limiting the use of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets.

This would be bad news for crypto asset use cases such as decentralized finance and merchant applications, and would put U.S. cryptocurrency users in a “walled garden,” effectively negating its core value of resistance to censorship and seizure. It would also force many users to go “offshore” for such services, weaking both the protective oversight from U.S. regulators and the role of the U.S. as a financial innovation hub.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

The S&P 500, Nasdaq and even the FTSE 100 saw further gains this week, which I still find bewildering.

It looks like I’m not the only one: The European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and Federal Reserve have all warned this month about shocks to the market should the coronavirus situation continue to worsen. And it looks like it is doing just that, given the latest confirmed case statistics. The latest news on vaccination progress is hopeful, yet expectations are likely to be disappointed by logistical complications and revised efficacy estimates, and the markets seem to be pricing in a strong economic recovery in the short term. A lot can happen to delay that recovery, and not just further surges as Thanksgiving and Christmas throw us together and winter temperatures push us indoors. There’s also the looming possibility of a hard Brexit, which will hit both the U.K. and Europe.

That doesn’t mean that markets won’t keep at the laughing gas, though. If there’s bad news, the belief seems to be that governments will support the markets. If there’s good news, then obviously it’s not discounted. Obviously.

Gold also defied expectations this week, dropping to its lowest point since July as (according to analysts) investors decided now was a good time to move into risk assets and double down on the economic recovery bet. Yes, you read that right.

Bitcoin, which at times trades with gold and at times trades as a risk asset, continued to soar, reaching an annual high of almost $19,375 and only just depriving an expectant crypto community from a new all-time-high (ATH) celebration. (According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the ATH is $19,783. Here is a good explanation of why there is confusion over what the ATH actually is.)

The bitcoin price started to correct early on Wednesday, and once the U.S. markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday the correction turned into a rout, unwinding its gains for the past 10 days (at time of writing – at this pace, things could have radically changed by the time you read this).

CHAIN LINKS

In searching for the reasons behind the recent bitcoin run-up (before this week’s slump), many pointed fingers at the institutions. While we have been hearing for years now about the fabled institutional “wall of money” poised to rush in and push BTC prices to stratospheric levels, there are some signs that institutional interest is growing.

The CIO of Fixed Income of BlackRock , the largest investment manager in the world, said on CNBC last week that bitcoin could take the place of gold to a large extent, because crypto is “so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around.”

(owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk), retail trading volumes from South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria and Indonesia have trebled over the past month. Dan Morehead, CEO and founder of fund manager Pantera Capital, believes that PayPal is behind the rally, buying almost 70% of new bitcoin supply on behalf of its retail users.

In an interview on CNBC, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said he believes bitcoin’s usefulness as a currency will ultimately prevail over the buy-and-hold ethos. TAKEAWAY: He has invested his company’s money in these beliefs, promising PayPal users the ability to use cryptocurrencies in approximately 28 million businesses as of early next year. While many of us will splutter and say “but who would want to spend a store of value?!,” we should remember that some regions don’t have access to convenient payment rails. For many, cryptocurrencies may be a more convenient online payment method than fiat. And the applications that could be built on top of public blockchains to enhance this could end up supporting both innovation and cryptocurrencies’ overall value.

U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase no longer allows margin trading, in response to recent regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. TAKEAWAY: This is a setback for institutional participation on Coinbase – institutions want leverage, and will move to where they can get it.

In this compelling article, my colleague Ian Allison looks at the emergence of a strong bitcoin mining industry in North America, encouraged by the access to capital markets, regulatory stability and the relatively low energy and hosting costs. TAKEAWAY: This is significant for two main reasons: 1) the diversification of the mining base strengthens the protocol’s resilience against political interference, and 2) the enhanced access to capital markets is likely to encourage even more investment in network maintenance. The greater the number of miners working on maintaining the network, the greater its security.

New York-based investment management firm VanEck has launched a bitcoin exchange-traded-note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra. TAKEAWAY: This will be the third exchange-traded product to list on Xetra, one of the largest electronic trading platforms in Europe, with a broad international reach (around 50% of its trading participants are from outside Germany).

Following on from a 3.35% gain on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week down by 1.05% to $18,196.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $17,556.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $17,144, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high $18.344.0.

Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $18,129. A late pullback, however, saw Bitcoin fall back through the first major resistance level before wrapping up the day at $18,190 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest slide back to sub-$17,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $9,920 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Sunday.

Ripple’s XRP fell by 3.36% to buck the trend on the day.

It was a bullish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Litecoin rallied by 8.58% to lead the way.

Binance Coin (+3.14%), Ethereum (+7.21%), and Polkadot (+3.53%) also found strong support.

Bitcoin Cash SV (+0.30%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.89%), Chainlink (+2.22%), and Crypto.com Coin (+1.54%) saw relatively modest gains on the day.

It was also a mixed bag for the week.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-5.83%), Chainlink (-7.77%), Crypto.com Coin (-6.11%), Litecoin (-4.76%), and Polkadot (-4.63%) joined Bitcoin in the red.

It was a bullish week for the rest of the majors, however.

Ripple’s XRP surged by 35.79% to lead the way, with Cardano’s ADA rallying by 14.13%.

Binance Coin (+0.18%), Ethereum (+2.85%) trailed the front runners, however.

At the start of the week, the crypto total market cap rose from a Monday low $538.06bn to a Monday high $547.50bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $547.21bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance fell from a Monday high 62.80% to a low of 62.41%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.64%.

Story continues

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.39% to $18,449.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $18,196.0 to a high $18,481.0

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. Polkadot was down by 1.09% to buck the trend early on.

It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 4.37% to lead the way.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $18,032 to bring the first major resistance level at $18,508 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break through to $18,500 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.

In the event of a crypto breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at $19,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $18,820.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $18,032 pivot would bring the first major support level at $17,720 into play.

Barring another extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$17,500 levels. The second major support level sits at $17,244.

Bitcoin & Ether Plummet More than 10% Each: The End of the Bull Run?

All eyes have been on Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) over the course of the last week as both coins shot for the moon: Bitcoin saw an impressive push to nearly $20,000, while Etherium was on a bull run of its own. ETH reached highs of nearly $620 earlier this week, its highest point since June of 2018.

However, it seems that the bull run that both coins were riding for most of this month may be coming to an end after heavy, heavy falls for both.

With expert insights from Scott Freeman, Co-founder of JST Capital, and Ed Nwokedi, Chief Executive at real estate tokenization platform RedSwan CRE, Finance Magnates asked and answered the question; is this the end of the bull run?

IRS Sends Warning Notices to Crypto Investors

As Finance Magnates covered on Friday, The Internal Revenue Service in the United States (IRS) is reportedly sending notices to US investors for under-reporting crypto gains.

Over the last week, dozens of individuals received CP2000 from the IRS. An IRS issue CP2000 notice is sent to an individual if the agency thinks that there is a difference between the income information IRS has on file and the information a person has reported on tax returns.

However, tax experts say that the IRS is mistaken and added that the main problem is that coinbase and other crypto exchanges use form 1099K to report user data instead of 1099 or 1099B.

It is worth noting that, currently, the future price of Bitcoin remains debatable, but the companies demonstrate that holding Bitcoin is less risky than not having any,” the official report states.

Institutional Adoption

In recent months, US-based investment firms and technology companies have taken significant measures to increase bitcoin holding. Finance Magnates reported today that Wall Street’s leading asset management firm, Guggenheim Partners filed with the SEC to seek 10% investment exposure in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an amount roughly equal to $500 million as of now. The recent flurry of investments in digital assets indicating that the companies will keep accumulating crypto assets in the future to take advantage of the limited supply.

“The acquisition of a significant amount of Bitcoin is an indicator that institutions are moving towards holding Bitcoin instead as opposed to cash-settled futures. Overall, the integration of institutional investors into the crypto ecosystem and their interest in holding is a positive sign for the asset’s prospects as another form of currency,” the report cites.",2020-11-30 13:39:53+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/bitcoin-jumps-to-record-as-advocates-say-this-time-is-different,"Why did this happen?

Nearly three years after it went on a hair-bending rise and hit a peak of $19,783, the price of a single Bitcoin rose above that for the first time on Monday, according to the data and news provider CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency has soared since March, after sinking below $4,000 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Bitcoin’s latest climb is different from its last spike in 2017, which was driven largely by investors in Asia who had just learned about cryptocurrencies. Back then, the digital token soon lost momentum as people questioned what it could do other than allow for easy online speculating and drug and ransom payments.

While those questions remain, Bitcoin is now being fueled by a less speculative fever. Buyers — led by American investors, including companies and other traditional investors — are treating Bitcoin as an alternative asset, somewhat like gold, according to an analysis from the data firm Chainalysis. Rather than quickly trading in and out of it, more investors are using Bitcoin as a place to park part of their investment portfolios outside the influence of governments and the traditional financial system, Chainalysis and other industry firms said.

“It’s a very different set of people who are buying Bitcoin recently,” said Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, which analyzes the movement of cryptocurrencies. “They are doing it in steadier amounts over sustained periods of time, and they are taking it off exchanges and holding it as an investment.”",2020-11-30 00:00:00,https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/weekly-recap-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trigger-mass-liquidations-685869,"But during the week of October 23rd, it appears that cryptocurrency enthusiasts decided to follow the herd.

Bitcoin kicked off the week trading at a low of $18,437, and while prices consolidated throughout the following 28 hours, investors began to enter a state of FOMO. Market participants seem to have feared to miss the chance for another leg up that will send BTC towards $25,000. As a result, a significant number of buy orders were recorded across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges on November 24th that pushed prices up nearly 6%.

As the flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new yearly high of $19,500 on November 25th, some of the so-called “whales” were selling their holdings. The sudden spike in selling pressure triggered a long squeeze across the board. Consequently, Bitcoin took a 17% nosedive to hit a low of $16,200.

On its way down, on-chain data shows that roughly 200,000 traders betting to the upside were liquidated. Losses accounted for more than $2 billion in long positions. Despite the significant downward price action, Bitcoin partially recovered during the last two days of the week.

Prices rose over 5%, and BTC closed Friday’s trading session, November 27th, at $17,000. Bitcoin holders incurred a weekly loss of 7.74%.

Ethereum Holders Incurred More Than 10% in Weekly Losses

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum also kicked off the week of November 23rd on a good posture. Its price entered Monday’s trading session at a high $574 and quickly continued rising. It seems like the break of an ascending triangle on November 20th was significant enough to allow the upward momentum to spill over the next few days.

As speculation mounted around the Ethereum Foundation reaching the threshold to roll out the most anticipated ETH 2.0 upgrade, market participants bought into the narrative. The spike in demand allowed Ether to surge to a new yearly high of $620. But as prices peaked at this level, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator presented a sell signal on the 4-hour chart indicating that a pullback was going to occur.

Those who were able to spot the bearish formation in time were lucky since what followed was a 23% correction. Ethereum saw its price plummet from a high of $620 on November 24th all the way down to a low of $480 on November 26th. Despite the significant losses, stablecoins began to flood exchanges as prices were collapsing.

More than 720 million USDT, 230 million DAI, 85 million BUSD, and 317 million USDC were transferred to known exchange wallets. The uptick in stablecoins exchange inflow suggested that sidelined investors were preparing to “buy the dip.” The increase in buy orders helped Ethereum recover some of the losses incurred to close Friday, November 27th, at $517.

Guggenheim Partners disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that its Macro Opportunities Fund held the right to invest up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

The trust invests solely in Bitcoin, and a 10% bet from Guggenheim's fund would equate to roughly $530 million.

The cryptocurrency on Monday leaped to an all-time intraday high of $19,873.23, eclipsing the record set in December 2017, before paring gains.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Guggenheim Partners is the latest Wall Street firm to show interest in Bitcoin, and a Friday regulatory filing signals the firm could make a massive investment in the soaring cryptocurrency.

Guggenheim disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published Friday that its Macro Opportunities Fund held the right to invest up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The trust invests solely in Bitcoin, allowing its shares to serve as a proxy for the popular cryptocurrency.

The fund manages roughly $5.3 billion in assets, making a 10% investment worth about $530 million.

Guggenheim described cryptocurrencies as ""digital assets designed as a medium of exchange."" The firm added that, though it could gain exposure to Bitcoin through the Grayscale trust, it had no other plans to invest directly or indirectly in cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin charged to a record high on Monday, surpassing the record of $19,511 set in December 2017. The token jumped as high as $19,873.23 before paring some gains.

Guggenheim joins other Wall Street heavyweights who've expressed bullishness toward the volatile token. Mike Novogratz, the former hedge-fund manager who has long pushed for widespread use of cryptocurrencies, praised PayPal's decision in October to adopt them, describing it as an ""exciting day"" for the technology.

""All banks will now be on a race to service crypto,"" he tweeted on October 21. ""We have crossed the rubicon people.""

The billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones also backed Bitcoin last month, deeming the asset ""the best inflation trade."" With the Federal Reserve set to temporarily allow inflation above 2%, Bitcoin's decentralized nature protects its value from faster price growth, Jones said.

Guggenheim's filing suggests the firm is optimistic about Bitcoin but still sees several risks to the coin's run-up. A stake in Bitcoin could fall prey to its ""highly volatile"" nature, the firm said in the filing. It added that the cryptocurrency's value ""could drop precipitously"" for reasons including regulatory changes, a change in user preference to a competing token, or a ""crisis of confidence"" in the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin traded at $19,232.35 as of 12:25 p.m. ET, up roughly 166% year-to-date.

Shares of many stocks with close ties to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are flying high today. China-based bitcoin mining specialist Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT) rose as much as 23.3%. The bitcoin-focused investment fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) posted a maximum gain of 24.9%. Business analytics company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which recently converted most of its cash reserves into bitcoin, gained as much as 26.2%. Cryptocurrency asset manager Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) topped out at 29.6% and Chinese-American cryptocurrency miner Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) led the pack with a maximum gain of 42.5%.

These stocks rose in unison as the price of bitcoin tokens reached a new all-time high of $19,850 per token, according to Coindesk data. That was a 9.7% gain in 24 hours, capping a quick return from a 15% decline at the end of last week. Many alternative cryptocurrencies also rose dramatically today, including a 9% surge in Ethereum prices and a 7% increase for Ripple tokens.

So what

Bitcoin's big gains in 2020 look like a reminder of the skyrocketing chart in 2017, where the leading cryptocurrency's prices had increased by 1,030% by the end of November. The year-to-date gains are less impressive this time, stopping at 156% at the time of writing, but this year's chart started from $8,000 instead of $1,000. The market cap for the total bitcoin market was approximately $15.4 billion in early 2017 and $131 billion at the start of 2020. It's easier to move the needle on a smaller and less valuable asset.

The surge in 2020 started with a so-called halving in May. That's a technical event where the generation of new bitcoin tokens suddenly required twice as much computing power as before. This was the third such event in bitcoin's history and the next one is scheduled for May 2024. Halvings are done in order to limit the supply of new tokens, which should result in higher prices under the assumption that demand for bitcoin tokens will rise over time. The halvings of 2012 and 2016 did indeed kick off two impressive price increases over the next year or two, followed by fairly dramatic corrections at the end of each surge.

On the demand side of the equation, institutional investors have started to take a serious interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, asset management giant AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) is now telling investors that bitcoin has become a viable investment these days thanks to lower volatility and an emerging regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in general.

Now what

Bernstein suggests that bitcoin could be seen as an attractive alternative to gold, based on similar valuation ideas of limited supply and global demand.

All of the stocks mentioned above are crushing the broader stock market this year, often leaving the actual bitcoin token's gains far behind. But past performance is no guarantee of future returns. You could even call this a bubble, since some of the bitcoin-based winners have absolutely crushed the returns on pure bitcoin in 2020. That being said, many investors are more comfortable trading stocks than cryptocurrencies.

If you want some exposure to the exploding cryptocurrency market, you could do a lot worse than grabbing a few shares of a managed bitcoin fund like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust or Riot Blockchain. Just follow Bernstein's advice and limit your initial cryptocurrency buys to a small piece of your portfolio, stopping somewhere between 1% and 10% of your total holdings.",2020-11-30 00:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-version-giving-tuesday-returns-232555357.html,"With the holiday season approaching and cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin (BTC) surging in price, charities are warming to the opportunity to accept donations of the digital tender.

Slated for Dec. 1, the crypto rendition of the annual worldwide charity event #GivingTuesday – #BitcoinTuesday – is back for another year, spearheaded by crypto donations platform The Giving Block.

According to the organization, while last year’s Bitcoin Tuesday event managed to attract only 12 non-profits, this year over 120 such organizations, including Save the Children, No Kid Hungry and The Tor Project have signed up for the event. The non-profits will accept donations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC), among others.

“In general, as the price goes up, you see a lot more donations. And we saw that happen a lot in 2017,” said Alex Wilson, co-founder of the Giving Block, adding that donations may even rise because people may look to offset their tax liability amid rising prices for crypto assets.

While charity is its own reward, making the donation in cryptocurrencies can help users avoid some capital gains taxes they might otherwise have incurred had they cashed out their crypto and donated fiat, tax experts have noted.

Because cryptocurrencies are treated like property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and some other tax agencies around the world, taxable events occur every time a user converts crypto to fiat.

But like stock donations, users can donate cryptocurrencies, get a tax write-off and not have to worry about paying capital gains tax on the cryptocurrency they donate.

Diversifying donations

Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that works toward improving education, health and water facilities for residents of the Caribbean nation, is one the charities accepting crypto donations. According to the non-profit’s CEO, Skyler Badenoch, the idea was spurred in part by a need to diversify donation sources. So it did some research on the market.

Story continues

“We know how much litecoin it would take to pay a teacher’s salary, we know how much XRP it would take to plant a tree,” said Badenoch. He noted tthe non-profit is also keen on exploring how blockchain technology can help add transparency to the charity sector.

A non-profit focused on tackling child hunger in the United States, No Kid Hungry, is another organization that will be taking part in the Bitcoin Tuesday campaign. The non-profit, similar to Hope for Haiti, also indicated it swaps gifted crypto for fiat upon receipt.

“Similar to stock donations, we convert cryptocurrency donations into U.S. dollars immediately,” said Diane Clifford, managing director of constituency development at No Kid Hungry.

A bitcoin tradition

In addition to the Giving Block campaign, users can also make crypto donations through BitGive.

Founded in 2013, BitGive helped co-host one of the first Bitcoin Giving Tuesday events in 2014 and has since continued to support charities in the United States and overseas. The first crypto-specific registered non-profit organization, BitGive uses the Bitcoin blockchain and RSK sidechain to help donors see where the money is going.

“We tackled these more simple concepts many years ago,” said founder Connie Gallippi. “We are excited to now have grown and developed a sophisticated platform leveraging the technology directly and demonstrating the beauty of bitcoin and blockchain to a mainstream audience.”

Since those early days, BitGive has added a layer of transparency through its GiveTrack tool, allowing donors to follow the money and see where and how it is allocated. Some of its most recent project announcements include partnerships with Heifer International, an organization that works to eradicate hunger and poverty, and Black Girls Code.

In an effort to give newcomers to crypto donations an easy way to donate, BitGive has announced that donors can now make donations on its GiveTrack platform using credit/debit cards or Apple Pay through Wyre.

“Our platform will automatically convert their donation into bitcoin and send BTC to the charity’s wallet,” said Gallippi in an email. She added that this way mainstream users who have never owned cryptocurrencies could take advantage of the blockchain-associated transparency without the hassle or friction of having to buy some.

Market moves

All sorts of reasons were cited Monday as bitcoin pushed to a new all-time-high, ranging from PayPal’s (PYPL) recent entry into the space to the collective market shrug in response to the massive outflows from the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange after a five-month withdrawal suspension was lifted.

What’s clear is that most analysts, traders and industry executives are talking about the sudden influx of big investors and Wall Street firms nosing into bitcoin and digital-asset markets for the first time. As noted Monday in First Mover, “institutional adoption” has become among the buzziest of buzzwords from bitcoin bulls and marketeers.

The key driver of their interest appears to be the desire for a hedge against inflation, during a year when the deep economic toll from the coronavirus has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to pump trillions of dollars of emergency liquidity and monetary stimulus global financial markets.

“With so much excess liquidity in the system, the original investment case for bitcoin is being vindicated.” Rich Rosenblum, who heads trading at the crypto firm GSR, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey. On Monday, just before bitcoin prices began their single-day price climb of 8.3% to end the month, the market was filled with chatter about a new endorsement from an analyst at the $631 billion investment firm AllianceBernstein. (“I have changed my mind about bitcoin.”) Later in the day, CNBC reported that strategists for another Wall Street firm, BTIG, said cryptocurrency had come of age, and that bitcoin should reach $50,000 by the end of next year.

“The stream of institutions commenting and allocating to BTC became a flood of good news that reinforced the narrative,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, told subscribers in an email.

CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported that support from institutional investors might help to sustain the latest rally, contrasted with the bull run of 2017 when prices briefly touched these levels before quickly tumbling and then hibernating in a bear market for most of 2018.

“Broadly speaking, institutional positions and high-net-worth individuals are leading the way this time,” Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, told Decrypt.

Another difference from 2017 is that digital-asset markets appear to have evolved dramatically in the past few years and appeared to have handled the recent uptick in intensity and transaction volumes without too many glitches. (The well-trod fiat-to-cryptocurrency on-ramp Coinbase did report delays in processing some bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion.)

“The trading, settlement and custody services are all far more sophisticated and mature, which instills confidence,” GSR’s Rosenblum said.

Major spot exchanges, where retail customers casually buy the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, have seen an uptick. Combined daily volume for Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini and ItBit was at $1.5 billion as of press time Monday, much higher the $488 million average of the past six months, CoinDesk’s Dan Cawrey reported.

Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, wrote in his weekly blog that some big investors, due to regulatory concerns, might be using futures on U.S. commodities exchanges or publicly traded investment vehicles in traditional stock markets to gain exposure to bitcoin – instead of just jumping into digital-asset markets. He provided a chart showing how key closures on public U.S. markets over the past week coincided with big swings in 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week cryptocurrency markets.

“The institutions are coming all right, but they are taking the local bus while the rest of us are on the express,” Dorman wrote.

The upshot is that bitcoin is reaching new all-time-highs when institutional adoption hasn’t even really got going, in the truest sense.

Bitcoin watch

Bitcoin's implied volatility rises to multi-month highs. Source: Skew.

Bitcoin’s one-month implied volatility has risen to 6.5-month highs, reflecting increased expectations of price turbulence over the next four weeks.

According to data source Skew, the metric influenced by demand for call and put options has increased to 89%, the highest level since May 18, having bottomed out near 44% in September. The doubling of implied volatility has happened alongside bitcoin’s rally from $10,000 to $19,920 and looks to have been caused by relatively higher demand for call options (bullish bets).

That’s evident from the record low one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls. The options market looks positioned for a continued rally.

Some analysts say a healthy pullback could be in the offing as bitcoin’s inflow to exchanges has exceeded outflows since the Thanksgiving sell-off, according to data source CryptoQuant. “That on-chain metric could indicate a short-term bearish trend, sending bitcoin back to a level of around $16,000,” said Ki Yong Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant.

At press time, bitcoin is trading near $18,800, representing a 4% drop on the day.

The most-traded digital asset rose as high as $19,907 on Monday, rebounding from its Thanksgiving Day plunge to set successive record highs this week. The surge buoyed other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Litecoin.

“Fear of missing out is slowly kicking in,"" said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of Nexo in London, which bills itself as the world’s biggest digital-coin lender. “We are only just beginning to see some of our retail clients borrowing against their Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin and that will ultimately propel the rally well into the $20,000s.""

Bitcoin, worth less than $1 back in 2010 when it was touted as currency for purchases, is now amassing proponents who argue that its strictly controlled supply and wider investor base show it’s become a store of value. Critics, however, say this year’s 175% rally is a bubble that can’t be supported by claims that digital assets should diversify portfolios and take flows from gold.

Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore, sees investors targeting up to $25,000. But after that he expects a 30% drop, since Bitcoin tends to “get everyone bullish and then dump,"" he said.

Bitcoin’s surge this week “is likely a result of major institutional investors joining the bandwagon and purchasing a portion of BTC’s limited supply in the midst of a bull run,"" said Gunnar Jaerv, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based custodian First Digital Trust.

The digital unit touched an all-time peak of $19,864.15, breaking its prior record set nearly three years ago. It was last up 6.1 percent at $19,306.35. Last Friday, however, bitcoin dropped more than 8 percent, below $17,000, before rebounding on Monday.

This year, the asset class saw a climb of 170 percent fuelled on the back of long list of positive triggers: Biden's huge victory, hopes of a fiscal and monetary stimulus, demand for riskier assets, Square's purchase of $50 million in BTC and PayPal's support for crypto operations.

The eye-popping gains that BTC made this year is also due to its small quantity. The ownership of BTC remains highly concentrated in the hands of a small number of investors who are the early adopters of the digital currency.

In fact, according to Flipside Crypto, about 2 percent of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control 95 percent of the digital asset

“Bitcoin’s moment has arrived,” said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at the trading platform eToro, “This rally could still have quite a ways to go.”

Many analysts at the year beginning had predicted the bitcoin rally. Prominent investors including Paul Tudor Jones said they’ve bought the cryptocurrency as a hedge against central bank and government actions.

Brian Estes, chief investment officer at hedge fund Off the Chain Capital predicted bitcoin could hit between $100,000 and $288,000 by end-2021, based on a model that utilizes the stock-to-flow ratio measuring the scarcity of commodities like gold. That model, he said, has a 94 percent correlation with the price of bitcoin.

Few experts also feel that the price could climb even higher. Like, Citi technical analyst Tom Fitzpatrick said in a note earlier that bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of next year, citing its limited supply, ease of movement across borders, and opaque ownership.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-new-all-time-high-as-crypto-market-matures,"Bitcoin price officially reached a new all-time high above $19,892 on Dec. 1 after nearly three years, according to data from Coinbase and Tradingview.

Despite the Thanksgiving crash last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price managed to rebound throughout the weekend. BTC then easily passed the $19,000 mark on Monday to reach its all-time high, albeit on a couple of exchanges.

There are three key trends that fueled BTC's rise from sub-$3,600 in March to over $19,892. These include the rise in institutional demand, lower selling pressure and the resilience of BTC throughout 2020.

Data suggests institutional demand propelled the rally

Most on-chain data points show that the demand for Bitcoin from institutions has been rapidly increasing.

In November, Grayscale recorded all-time high net inflows, and the CME Bitcoin futures market saw its open interest climb near $1 billion.

Grayscale, in particular, said that more institutions invested in cryptocurrencies during the third quarter of 2020 than ever before.

The figures Grayscale sees are important to gauge the institutional interest in Bitcoin because the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is typically the first point of entry for most institutions to gain exposure to BTC.

In the United States, there is no exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Hence, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the closest investment vehicle to an ETF in the U.S. market. The Grayscale report reads:

“More institutions invested in 3Q20 than ever before and have increased their average allocation from $2.2 million in 3Q19 to $2.9 million in 3Q20. Institutions that are comfortable with multiple products within the Grayscale suite of products, have averaged nearly double the commitments of single-product investors during 3Q20.”

As Cointelegraph reported in August, MicroStrategy purchased $450 million worth of BTC, adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. This was likely the spark that triggered the current wave of institutional demand for the digital store of value.

This was accompanied throughout the summer by high-profile allocations to Bitcoin from the likes of Square, Paul Tudor Jones, and later, Stanley Druckenmiller, which only further fueled the positive market sentiment.

In November, Druckenmiller explained that Bitcoin is likely here to stay, as it has significantly outperformed gold in 2020, saying:

""It’s been around for 13 years and with each passing day it picks up more of its stabilization as a brand.""

Low whale inflows

Six months after the halving, November also saw low selling pressure from whales, according to on-chain data. In other words, the amount of Bitcoin being sent to exchanges from high-net-worth investors consistently decreased throughout the month.

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju pinpointed the Exchange Whale Ratio as an indicator of long-term bullish market sentiment. He said:

“Dear $BTC shorters, You can call me a moon boy, but unfortunately, there won't be a mass-dumping like March this year. Exchange Whale Ratio(90-day MA) is still very low. Long-term bullish is inevitable.”

The low selling pressure on BTC helped sustain its rally throughout the month, eventually allowing the dominant cryptocurrency to reach a record high.

Bitcoin's resilience has been a big factor

On June 13, JPMorgan Chase said in a note that Bitcoin’s recovery from the March crash showed it had staying power. The recognition of Bitcoin’s resilience by the largest investment bank in the U.S. likely acted as a major confidence boost, especially for institutional investors.

Ultimately, the impressive performance over the past decade and Bitcoin's strong momentum since dropping below $3,600 across major exchanges in March demonstrated BTC’s resilience and long-term potential as a digital store of value.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockfi-crypto-currency-visa-idUSKBN28B603,"(Reuters) - Cryptocurrency startup BlockFi said on Tuesday it would partner with Visa Inc, Evolve Bank and credit card firm Deserve to offer a credit card that lets users earn bitcoin on purchases.

Card users will receive a 1.5% cashback on an accrual basis for every transaction made through the card, which will then be converted to bitcoin and placed into a BlockFi account in a regular monthly cycle.

The service will initially be offered only in the United States and the shipping of cards will start in spring next year, BlockFi said in a blog post.

The move by BlockFi comes after PayPal Holdings Inc in October said it would allow customers to hold bitcoin and other virtual coins in its online wallet and shop using cryptocurrencies, a move which could help bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies gain wider adoption as viable payment methods.

Bitcoin has surged about 160% this year, fueled by demand for riskier assets amid unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, interest in assets perceived as resistant to inflation and expectations that cryptocurrencies will win mainstream acceptance.",2020-12-01 18:12:07+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/ethereum-2point0-eth-cryptocurrencys-network-starts-a-major-upgrade.html,"Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value.

While you've been watching the price of bitcoin soar to an all-time high, another cryptocurrency has been quietly staging a comeback of its own. Ether, the world's second-largest virtual currency by market value, is up about 350% since the start of the year. Last week, it briefly passed $600 for the first time since June 2018 before slumping sharply, and touched that level again this week. Now, ether investors are keeping an eye on a long-delayed upgrade to its underlying network known as Ethereum 2.0, which they say will make it faster and more secure. A key problem with the Ethereum blockchain today is scalability. In 2017, for example, the popularity of an Ethereum-based game called CryptoKitties caused the network to become heavily congested, significantly slowing trade. But proponents of Ethereum 2.0 say that the planned upgrade could allow thousands more transactions to take place every second. Meanwhile, investors believe it could also lead to further adoption of ether as well as price appreciation.

'Proof of stake'

To understand the transition taking place on Ethereum, it's important to first know a little about blockchain technology. Blockchain is the digital ledger originally used to record bitcoin transactions and provides the foundation for most major cryptocurrencies.

Like bitcoin, Ethereum's blockchain currently operates on a ""proof of work"" model. So-called ""miners"" with purpose-built computers compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions. Whoever wins that race is then awarded in bitcoin. On Tuesday, the Ethereum blockchain is set to begin a transition to a ""proof of stake"" model. Instead of miners, the network will rely on ""stakers"" who already hold some ether to process new transactions. In order to validate a transaction on the new network, a staker must deposit 32 ether tokens, worth about $19,600 at current prices, into a crypto wallet using what's known as a smart contract. These are contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that are automatically executed using code. The stakers are then awarded ether for validating transactions, like crypto miners. This process of ""staking"" effectively gives crypto investors the ability to earn interest on their holdings after a certain period of time. A big theme in Ethereum right now is decentralized finance, or DeFi, which aims to replicate traditional financial products such as loans without middlemen like the banks. Some crypto evangelists say Ethereum's ability to support apps mean it could become a structure for a decentralized, next-generation internet. ""In essence, the Ethereum ecosystem has made the decision to grow up a little more and become a little more secure so that people, institutions and developers can continue to build more apps and financial products on top of it,"" Konstantin Richter, CEO of blockchain software firm Blockdaemon, told CNBC.

What does it mean for investors?

For now, what's happening is the introduction of a parallel Ethereum blockchain known as Beacon. This will be used to test the new proof of stake system ahead of a full migration to Ethereum 2.0. ""It's a little bit like the launch,"" Richter said. ""The rocket is now taking off. We've committed to the journey. We're still on the launchpad but all will be achieved when we land on the moon. At this point, we're launching the official end to the old Ethereum."" In the meantime, more and more ether is getting stashed away for a restrictive multi-year ""lockup"" period by token holders seeking to become validators of transactions on the new network.",2020-12-01 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/dollar-cost-averaging-investment-strategy,"Bitcoin has come a long way since bottoming out below $4,000 in March. The cryptocurrency clocked a record high above $19,900 early Tuesday and is up nearly 170% this year.

While institutional participation has increased, a large part of the retail crowd may have stayed away from the market. For that group, the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the opportunity to make triple-digit gains may have set in over the past few weeks.

Yet, investing now while the cryptocurrency is trading near lifetime highs may seem risky because there is always a possibility of significant price pullback. Bitcoin has seen several pullbacks of over 20% during the previous bull markets.

As such, investors looking to buy bitcoin now should consider implementing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, according to leading traders in the cryptocurrency space.

“It is a good way to build exposure to both bitcoin as well as other asset classes such as global equity indices, as both look set to perform well against a backdrop of negative real rates for the next few years,” Scott Weatherill, chief dealer at the over-the-counter liquidity provider B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.

How dollar-cost averaging saves money

DCA, also known as the constant dollar plan, involves buying smaller amounts of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of price gyrations, instead of investing the entire amount at one time. The strategy helps investors take the emotion out of their trades and can result in a lower average purchase cost because markets seldom move higher without pullbacks.

“Dollar-cost averaging in bitcoin has historically been a very profitable strategy that lowers drawdown risk,” Weatherill said.

To illustrate, let’s say an investor has been accumulating $100 worth of bitcoin at the highest price observed on the 17th of every month, starting from Dec. 17, 2017, when bitcoin peaked at $19,783. As of press time, that investor would own roughly 0.48 BTC at an average cost of around $8,660. It also means the investor would be making a nearly 120% gain at the current market price of $18,850.

Bitcoin prices, Nov. 30, 2017, to Dec. 1, 2020. Buying at the top would have meant missing cheaper entry points in subsequent months.

However, if the investor made a lump-sum investment at the record price of $19,783 on Dec. 17, 2017, the investment would currently suffer a loss of 4.7%. Over a long period, that loss could be more significant when adjusted for inflation.

Dollar-cost averaging in action Source: Omkar Godbole

In the former case, the investor spread out $3,600 over 36 months, buying fewer bitcoin when prices were high and more when prices were low. That helped pull down the average cost and bring in a substantial gain. The strategy has delivered similar results during the previous bull-bear cycles.

“Ideally, one must invest with a hope of selling at higher prices in the long run,” Chris Thomas, head of products at Swissquote Bank, said. “The best way, in my opinion, is to buy each month and build up a position over the longer term.”

The risk of certain option strategies for retail traders

Some investors may think of implementing synthetic strategies through the options market, such as buying a put option against a long position in the spot market. The put would gain value in the event of a sell-off, mitigating the loss (on paper) in the long spot market position.

Yet, such strategies are more suitable for speculators who intend to profit from short-term price volatility and go against the idea of pulling down the average purchase cost via DCA. “I wouldn’t recommend buying puts if you are ‘DCAing,’ as it would crimp returns,” Weatherill said.

A put option is a derivative contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy.

An option buyer needs to pay a premium upfront while taking a long call/put position. A long put position makes money only if the asset settles below the put’s strike price on the day of expiry. Otherwise, the option expires worthless, causing a loss – in this case, the premium paid – for the buyer.

What’s more, those trying to combine DCA with an options hedge may end up hurting their portfolios. For example, if an investor buys puts while DCAing and the market goes up, the options bought to hedge against a potential downturn would bleed money, crimping overall returns from dollar-cost averaging.

“Retail investors should stay away from options trading,” warned Thomas. He added that one particular strategy, selling out-of-the-money calls, is extremely dangerous.

Savvy traders often generate additional income by selling call options well above bitcoin’s current spot price and collecting premiums on hopes the market wouldn’t rally above the level at which the bullish bet is sold. However, with short call positions, holders can theoretically suffer unlimited loss because the sky’s the limit for any asset.

In the case of bitcoin, that’s particularly risky as sentiment remains bullish, with analysts expecting a continued bull run on increased institutional demand. As such, selling call option(s) while DCAing could prove costly.",2020-12-01 20:16:21+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/86344/crypto-exchange-volume-november,"Trade volume across legitimate crypto exchanges rose by 134% in November compared to the previous month, according to data collected by The Block Research.

After declaring in 2018 that bitcoin has no place in investment portfolios, Bernstein Research's co-head of portfolio strategy told clients on Monday that he's changed his mind.

Inigo Fraser-Jenkins said that the policy environment, debt levels, and diversification options for investors have changed since the pandemic and made bitcoin more attractive.

The strategist also said that bitcoin's volatility has dropped significantly in the last three years.

He recommended a number of portfolio strategies that involve a small allocation to bitcoin, alongside stocks and US treasuries.

Once a crypto skeptic, Bernstein Research's co-head of portfolio strategy now says bitcoin should have a place in investors' portfolios.

""I have changed my mind about bitcoin's role in asset allocation,"" said Inigo Fraser-Jenkins in a Monday note to clients. His take comes as the coin reaches new record highs and has seen year-to-date gains of over 160%.

But bitcoin's most recent rally isn't exactly what made Fraser-Jenkins change his mind. The strategist explained that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the policy environment, debt levels, and diversification options for investors, and that this has all made bitcoin an attractive asset.

The pandemic has resulted in increased fiscal expansion, and a higher likelihood of inflation and tax increases. These policy factors will increase the demand for bitcoin, Fraser-Jenkins said.

However, he also acknowledged a paradox that could hurt bitcoin's continued rise: ""The greater role that governments will likely play in economies makes cryptos potentially more appealing. These very same forces also may hinder crypto. If they get in the way of policy implementation, then governments might seek to constrain them,"" he said.

However, Fraser-Jenkins doubts that governments will outlaw cryptocurrencies. He said that in order for this to happen, cryptos would need to get in the way of reflationary policy efforts from the government. At the moment, cryptos are too small to have an effect like this, said Fraser-Jenkins.

He added: ""The attractions of cryptos are what also make them potentially an annoyance for policymakers. Cryptos do have a place in asset allocation….for as long as they are legal!""

Fraser-Jenkins also changed his mind on bitcoin because the data on the cryptocurrency has changed since three years ago. The strategist said that bitcoin's volatility has significantly declined in the last three years, which marks it a more attractive store of value. Also, the relative volatility of bitcoin to both gold and stocks has declined to historically low levels, he said.

Fraser-Jenkins recommends investors add a small amount of bitcoin to their portfolios. In all scenarios, investors should own the S&P 500 and US 10 year government bonds. If the assumed bitcoin average monthly return is higher than 3%, that's when investors would add bitcoin.

This has been reflected in the stock market, which surges and retrenches based on vaccine announcements and distribution timelines. This same volatility has also driven buying of alternative stores of value. This includes that old standby of gold, as well as digital age alternatives like Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP. Bitcoin has just hit levels it last saw in December 2017, briefly setting a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency. We'll look at the factors driving Bitcoin's continued strength in 2020 and what it means for the market.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin has surged 90% in recent months and is up triple digits year to date.

The increased interest in cryptocurrencies during the pandemic is being driven, in part, by investors looking for an alternate store of value.

Whether this haven aspect of cryptocurrencies pans out over the longer term remains to be seen.

Cryptocurrencies' 2020 Rally

Bitcoin actually spent most of 2020 trading under the $10,000 mark before catching fire in late October. Bitcoin closed out November at $19,382, meaning it shot up over 90% over a period of a little more than a month. Year to date (YTD), Bitcoin currently sits 158% above where it was in December 2019. These are actually more modest numbers than competing – but less established – cryptocurrencies like Ether (346% YTD), XRP (216% YTD), and Stellar (297% YTD).﻿﻿﻿ Bitcoin is larger than these others in terms of trading volume and market cap, sitting at over $300 billion, with XRP and Ether next closest at the $60 billion level.

This is where we make the obligatory comparison to U.S. stocks – measured in tens of trillions of dollars – to put Bitcoin's (and the whole cryptocurrency realm) into context as far as relative size. Cryptocurrencies aren't trying to be stocks, however, and their status as an alternative store of value is increasingly catching the attention of individual and professional investors. Moreover, where it matters most, Bitcoin has handily beat the S&P 500 and gold futures in terms of performance over the span of 2020.

Leaning Into the Chaos

The pandemic has created unexpected winners and losers across broad sectors of the economy. On a national level, however, it has almost universally been awful. Many countries are opening the fiscal stimulus taps to keep the economy afloat long enough for vaccines to curb the worst of the pandemic. This widespread fiscal stimulus on a global scale has pushed down interest rates and real returns. Adding to this overall chaos, the financial deficits being run by many governments will eventually have an impact on the national finances, putting the future value of their currencies on shaky ground.

In this environment, Bitcoin's status as speculative investments seems less risky than it would in more stable times. Although there is no centralized management marketing Bitcoin, it is being positioned as a hedge against eventual inflation – similar to gold, but digital. Bitcoin's ability to act as an inflation hedge or an alternative haven currency like the U.S. dollar isn't established, but a number of funds have added small risk stakes (generally less than 5%) into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for just that purpose. The rally we have seen in the past two months likely means that more professionals and individual investors have done the same.

Bitcoin Very Different in 2020 versus 2009 or 2017

Although the pandemic, the search for real returns, and an overall desire for haven investments probably contributed the most to Bitcoin's surge, there is also the fact that it has come into its own as far as acceptance by the general public. Once primarily concentrated among a passionate, tech-savvy user base, Bitcoin can now be used for mundane transactions like buying a coffee or shopping online. The list of retailers that accept Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) continues to grow over time. There is still a lot of volatility as to the daily value of a Bitcoin – as the March low to November high shows – but that value can be tapped more easily than ever before.

The Bottom Line

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more broadly have benefited from the economic chaos of the pandemic and the national bills piling up to be paid in the future. Although Bitcoin is more of a known quantity than it was five years ago, it is still a speculative investment and should be approached with that level of caution by individual investors.

The fact that it has surged like it has by serving as a haven for some investors during an economic storm shows you just how bad this storm is. Whether this haven aspect of Bitcoin will work to remove some of its volatility in the long term, however, remains to be seen.",2020-12-02 14:59:26.628000+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-investors-won-t-save-crypto-but-they-will-help-it-grow,"The state of the world economy has pushed institutional investors to look for alternative methods of investment. And more and more often, Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming such a tool.

Since August, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has purchased BTC worth a total of $425 million. At the same time, digital asset manager Grayscale Investments raised record amounts of money in both the first and second quarters of this year ($1.4 billion in total).

But should we celebrate institutional investors as the “saviors” of crypto? Or, on the contrary, are they the ones that will lead to the digital asset industry’s downfall?

Related: Why institutions suddenly give a damn about Bitcoin

Safe assets are in a worldwide crisis

Before I answer the above questions, let’s look at the main reason that institutions are eyeing crypto. There is a worldwide crisis when it comes to generating returns from the traditional market’s safe assets. Low-risk instruments, such as savings accounts and high-quality bonds like U.S. Treasurys, have been providing minimal yields in recent years. The returns are so low for these assets that inflation often eats away the profits and leaves investors with a negative return on investment, or ROI.

Furthermore, some nations such as Denmark, Switzerland and Japan use negative interest rates to boost the economy. While it’s a good way to fight deflation, negative and low interest rates discourage people from investing in safe assets. However, this doesn’t mean that traditional instruments are failing investors. Instead, we are going through a phase in the world economy’s development where low-risk investments don’t yet provide decent returns to investors.

With that said, this will drive interest in cryptocurrencies until the global economy advances to a phase where traditional assets start performing well again. Compared with the general market, the digital asset industry has been developing at a much faster pace, with multiple reasons behind this phenomenon. The regulatory scrutiny surrounding the market is limited, and crypto projects have a different mindset. Also, the current technology level allows and encourages businesses in the space to innovate.

As a result, crypto has become a maturing industry that has a history of providing excellent returns to investors. Furthermore, even in the middle of a global economic crisis, Bitcoin’s volatility is at record-low levels. And the less volatile an asset is, the lower the risks are for investors.

While the above makes crypto attractive for individuals, the current digital asset market offers institutional investors a way to meet their investors’ ROI expectations. The stakes are high, and they are looking into Bitcoin for a very good reason.

The recent institutional surge’s impact on crypto

People in crypto often think that institutional investors will be the main facilitators of the next Bitcoin boom. However, that’s not exactly the case here. And the opposite — that institutions will corrupt the crypto market with their whale-sized investments — is not true either.

Instead of “destroying” the crypto market or launching Bitcoin “to the moon,” institutional investors help the crypto market mature, making it more efficient. For example, when BTC is underpriced, they use this inefficiency to drive it up, and they bring it down when the digital asset is overpriced.

Because institutional investors are seasoned investors with vast money-market experience, they follow the above practices to limit their risks and maximize their returns. This dampens the volatility and increases the market’s liquidity. However, factors like Bitcoin’s adoption rate and the current macroeconomic situation have a more substantial impact on the underlying long-term BTC price movement than do institutional investors.

On the flip side, a more mature market also means the potential gains from crypto investments will also decrease. But this won’t lead to the digital asset industry’s downfall. Instead, it’s a sign of the natural development that all new markets go through as they enter into the mass adoption phase, which will result in a more mature, more stable, less volatile cryptocurrency sector.

With that said, taking strong positions in crypto, like what MicroStrategy did recently, provides a buying signal to other institutional investors that will see cryptocurrency as a serious asset class. It’s important to note that MicroStrategy’s case with Bitcoin bears great significance, considering that the firm is a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Therefore, it has strict requirements for financial diligence to its shareholders. By acquiring substantial amounts of BTC, MicroStrategy believes firmly that this move won’t have adverse effects on its share price or corporate social responsibility.

If a private business — no matter how large — had taken the same position in crypto, it wouldn’t be a major news story like MicroStrategy’s.

With institutional investors, crypto looks forward to a brighter future

In 2017, we didn’t have many institutional investors in the crypto market. With so much fear of missing out, hype and fraud as well as so many cyber threats, speculation was the main force driving the initial-coin-offering craze and extreme bull market.

With effective regulation taking place in multiple jurisdictions and institutional investors making the market more effective, crypto is more mature than ever. Fewer risks and good returns make Bitcoin an attractive alternative investment for institutions. And now, they are coming to the industry in great numbers.

With the long-anticipated arrival of phase 0 of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade launching on Dec. 1, that could be the network’s native token, ether (ETH). But analysts say ether should be judged on its own merits and not as a bitcoin replacement.

“I’ve always thought this digital asset space is huge – and it’s not just bitcoin – because there are going to be different applications for different things,” Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of financial media group Real Vision, said in Real Vision’s documentary “Ethereum – An Investigation,” which was released on Nov. 30. “I think of the two [bitcoin and ether] as having a very nice combined asset allocation.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

For Pal, an early bitcoin investor, the rationale seems even more plausible these days: As bitcoin’s price hits a new all-time high, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now more expensive and thus potentially a riskier bet for new investors.

It can be expected investors are looking for a new opportunity in crypto at affordable prices. Given that ether is trading roughly 59% below its all-time high of $1,432.88, it is tempting to believe there’s a bargain to be had. What’s more, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to increase the network’s scalability, security and energy efficiency has generated a lot of hype.

However, at least for now, analysts and traders who spoke with CoinDesk don’t think ether will replace the FOMO over bitcoin.

“For institutional investors, they are buying BTC for the digital gold narrative,” Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “ETH just isn’t in that conversation yet.”

Ether “benefits from spillover and likely has more conversation around it from crypto-natives,” Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk. “For the uninitiated, [it is] hard to see how bitcoin is not the sole on-ramp.”

Weakening correlation between bitcoin and ether

Some analysts say that as more institutions pour money into bitcoin and push up its price, ether and other cryptocurrencies will gradually decouple from bitcoin.

Indeed, while bitcoin this week logged a record high price, ether isn’t even close to its all-time high of $1,448.18. Data from CoinDesk shows the 90-day correlation coefficient between the prices of the top two cryptocurrencies, while still strong, has gradually weakened a bit since the summer from as high as 0.93 to nearly 0.7 at the beginning of December.

Source: CoinDesk Research

“The thing about correlation is it can disappear at any time,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, research analyst at digital asset research firm Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk. “In that case, you want to understand the core fundamentals of what you hold because if you hold ether as a proxy [to your] bitcoin exposure, and [when] prices decouple, you are now exposed to something very different.”

Bitcoin has been used by many investors this year as a hedge against a drop in the purchasing power of U.S. dollars. Ether is considered the currency of “the world computer,” which aims to build an ecosystem of decentralized applications.

The close historical correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be due to how tiny the digital-asset ecosystem is relative to the global economy. The total market capitalization of crypto assets is estimated at $562 billion, a mere 1.7% of the S&P 500 stock index’s combined market cap of $32.2 trillion. With almost every crypto asset built on different fundamentals, non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies may be trending with bitcoin prices simply because the nascent market is still so small and insular.

Correlation data doesn’t tell the whole story. Prices may move in tandem but the degree to which that happens is another matter. When the explosive decentralized finance (DeFi) boom hit the market during the summer, ether’s price rallied to its highest in more than two years because most DeFi projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain. At the time, bitcoin was struggling to break a similar two-year record.

What Ethereum 2.0 could mean for investors

The market will have to wait and see what kind of real impact the ongoing Ethereum upgrade could have on its native currency because the final phase of the process is scheduled to be completed in 2023. But a major fundamental upgrade on the network underpinning ether could lead its price to move on its own fundamentals, instead of merely following bitcoin’s price.

“The heart of ETH 2.0, which makes the entire system possible, is ether,” according to a report by Messari. “ETH will not only be Ethereum’s native store of value asset and fuel for transactions, but will also be Ethereum’s ultimate source of security from its role in the [proof-of-stake] system.”

The move left XRP, the payments token used in Ripple’s global payments network, up 225% in 2020, versus the older and larger bitcoin’s 165% gain. XRP has a market capitalization of $21.4 billion, a fraction of bitcoin’s roughly $350 billion.

The frenzy in XRP may be driven by a looming airdrop of free “spark” tokens to anyone who holds XRP, some digital-markets analysts told CoinDesk last month.

There’s also the possibility that some first-time cryptocurrency buyers are unaware that it’s possible to buy a fraction of a bitcoin – divisible up to the eighth decimal, instead of a whole token. For the novice investor, XRP, currently changing hands at 62.3 cents, looks a lot cheaper on a price table than bitcoin’s $19,087.

“As the digital asset space has seen renewed interest in the second half of 2020, a new wave of investors are looking for ways to get exposure,” said Brian Mosoff, CEO of the publicly traded Canadian investment fund Ether Capital. “Ripple appears to offer exposure in their portfolio, and a quick Google search may result in some users believing XRP is cheap and likely to become a product banks utilize for cross-border settlement.”

Stellar, another payments token founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, was the second-best performer in November among the CoinDesk 20, gaining 153%. It’s up 313% on the year.

For comparison, bitcoin rallied 40% in November while ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose 56%.

Visa is releasing a new credit card that will offer cashback rewards to customers in Bitcoin in early 2021.

The payments company has partnered with cryptocurrency startup BlockFi for its ""Bitcoin Rewards Visa Credit Card,"" which comes at an annual fee of $200. Users will receive 1.5% of their purchases back in the form of the digital asset.

Cardholders will also receive a bonus of $250 in Bitcoin after spending $3,000 or more within the first three months of ownership, BlockFi said in a statement.

Waitlist registrations have already opened for both existing and new BlockFi account holders. But current BlockFi users will have first access as they can register, apply, and receive the new credit cards before everybody else. A public waitlist will open in early January.

The new card, which will be issued by Evolve Bank & Trust, seeks to serve the crypto-curious who are finding ways to add Bitcoin holdings to their investments. It ""offers an easy entry point, enabling consumers to accrue Bitcoin through everyday spending,"" BlockFi said.

""We're excited to add credit cards to our suite of products and expand bitcoin's accessibility to a broader set of consumers,"" Zac Prince, BlockFi's CEO and founder, said in a statement. ""This card makes it simple and risk-free for people to gain or increase exposure to a new asset class without changing their spending or investing habits.""

Visa's adoption of Bitcoin didn't start with BlockFi. In April, the credit card firm partnered with startup Fold to offer rewards denominated in Bitcoin. In February, Visa and Coinbase announced the Coinbase Card, which allows users to issue Bitcoin using debit cards.

Bitcoin has rallied 166% this year and hit record highs near $20,000 in the last week, driven by institutional buy-in and investors looking for a hedge against the devaluation of traditional paper money.

Interviewed by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross-Sorkin for the online 2020 tech conference, Schulman anticipated digital currencies soon entering the mainstream and becoming an everyday payments tool. The global coronavirus pandemic has accelerated various trends, such as consumers “abandoning cash,” he said.

The coronavirus pandemic “has pulled these trends forward anywhere between three to five years [and] five to six months,” according to Schulman.

He continued:

""I think that if you can create a financial system, a new and modern technology that is faster, that is less expensive, more efficient, that's good for bringing more people into the system, for inclusion, to help drive down costs, to help drive financial health for so many people... So, over the long run, I'm very bullish on digital currencies of all kinds.""

PayPal announced in October it will begin allowing users to transact with cryptocurrency as a funding instrument across 28 million merchants early next year. The company is already allowing customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies inside the PayPal wallet, starting in the U.S. Schulman said the company conducted market research in advance that showed 54% of PayPal’s base wanted the crypto offerings.

“As we thought about it, digital wallets are a natural complement to digital currencies. We’ve got over 360 million digital wallets and we need to embrace cryptocurrencies,” said the PayPal CEO.

Bitcoin‘s volatility had previously been Schulman’s primary concern, prompting him to consider it a “poor form of currency” with the potential to wipe out small merchants’ profits. In order to tackle this issue, PayPal will allow consumers to know the exact exchange rate of crypto at the moment of a purchase, removing the volatility risk.

“It bolsters the utility of that underlying cryptocurrency, and you can do more with it than just ride the ups and downs of it,” he said. “In effect, you’re taking that as an instrument that can conduct commerce at our 28 million merchants.”",2020-12-02 13:31:33+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-insight-idUKKBN28D0Q5,"LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoin has grabbed headlines this week with its dizzying ascent to an all-time high. Yet, under the radar, a trend has been playing out that could change the face of the cryptocurrency market: a massive flow of coin to North America from East Asia.

Bitcoin, the biggest and original cryptocurrency, soared to a record $19,918 on Tuesday, buoyed by demand from investors who variously view the virtual currency as a “risk-on” asset, a hedge against inflation and a payment method gaining mainstream acceptance.

But the boom represents a shift in the market, which has typically been dominated by investors in East Asian nations like China, Japan and South Korea since the digital currency was invented by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto over a decade ago.

It is North American investors who have been the bigger winners in the 165% rally this year.

Weekly net inflows of bitcoin - a proxy for new buyers - to platforms serving mostly North American users have jumped over 7,000 times this year to over 216,000 bitcoin worth $3.4 billion in mid-November, data compiled for Reuters shows.

East Asian exchanges have lost out.

Those serving investors in the region bled 240,000 bitcoin worth $3.8 billion last month, versus an inflow of 1,460 in January, according to the data from U.S. blockchain researcher Chainalysis.

The change is being driven by an increasing appetite for bitcoin among bigger U.S. investors, according to Reuters interviews with cryptocurrency platforms and investors from the United States and Europe to South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.

“The sudden influx of institutional interest from the North American region is driving a shift in bitcoin trading, which is rebalancing asset allocations across different exchanges and platforms,” said Ciara Sun of Seychelles-based Huobi Global Markets, whose parent company has roots in China and operates in several Asian markets.

‘CENTRE OF GRAVITY’

East Asia, North America and Western Europe are the biggest bitcoin hubs, with the first two alone accounting for about half of all transfers, according to Chainalysis, which gathers data by region with tools such as tagging cryptocurrency wallets.

Industry experts caution it is too early to call a fundamental shift in the market, particularly in an unprecedented year of pandemic-induced financial turmoil.

Growing flows to North America this year are not necessarily “an indication that the centre of gravity is tilting towards the U.S.,” said James Quinn of Q9 Capital, a Hong Kong cryptocurrency private wealth manager.

Others also point out that cryptocurrency trading is highly opaque compared to traditional assets and patchily regulated, making comprehensive data on the emerging sector rare.

Nonetheless, Chainalysis found North American trading volumes at major exchanges - those with the most blockchain activity - had eclipsed East Asia’s this year. This is not unheard of, with North America having moved ahead on occasions in the past, but never by such a large margin.

Volumes at four major North American platforms have doubled this year to reach 1.6 million bitcoin per week at the end of November, while trading at 14 major East Asian exchanges have risen 16% to 1.4 million, according to the data.

By comparison, a year before, East Asia led the way with 1.3 million a week versus North America’s 766,000.

U.S. INVESTORS DIVE IN

Those interviewed by Reuters said compliance-wary U.S. investors, many of whom had been deterred by the opaque nature of the market in the past, are being attracted by the tightening oversight of the American crypto industry.

U.S. exchanges are in general more tightly regulated than many of those in East Asia, and there have been several moves by American regulators and law-enforcement agencies this year to clarify how bitcoin is overseen.

A leading banking regulator said in July, for instance, that national banks could provide custody services for cryptocurrencies. The justice department also outlined an enforcement framework here for digital coins in October.

“You’re increasingly starting to see distinctions in the market between those that have no regulatory or little regulatory clarity, versus those that do,” said Curtis Ting of major U.S. exchange Kraken.

“Larger institutions seek the predictability that a regulated venue offers.”

Assets under management at New York-based Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, have soared to a record $10.4 billion, up more than 75% from September. Its bitcoin fund is up 85%.

“A lot of U.S. funds are trading with large U.S. counterparties,” said Christopher Matta of 3iQ, a Canadian digital asset manager with clients in the United States, citing exchanges such as California’s Coinbase that are overseen by New York financial regulators.

“It tells you right there how important the regulatory nature of the space is, and having venues to trade on that are regulated - it’s definitely something that institutional investors are thinking about.”

RETAIL ARMY STEPS BACK

Another factor behind the 2020 trend, crypto experts said, is a decline of the armies of retail investors in Asia who drove bitcoin’s 2017 boom, which pushed it to its previous peak.

In South Korea, strict regulations have been discouraging such investors, according to In Hoh of Korea University’s Blockchain Research Institute.

Concerns that major retail exchanges linked to China but headquartered elsewhere could be caught up in a crackdown by Beijing may have pushed down demand, said Leo Weese, co-founder of the Hong Kong Bitcoin Association.

In October, for instance, Malta-headquartered OKEx, which was founded in China, suspended crypto withdrawals for nearly six weeks because an executive was cooperating with an investigation by Chinese law enforcement.

OKEx resumed withdrawals on Nov. 26, and its reserves fully covered deposits so users could withdraw funds with no restrictions, said Lennix Lai, director of financial markets.

While Asia remains a major centre for crypto trading, some exchanges see a more profound shift happening.

“Nowadays, I think the influence is coming from North America,” said Yuzo Kano, co-founder of bitFlyer in Tokyo, which runs exchanges in Japan, Europe and the United States.

“There are a lot of funds buying there.”",2020-12-03 07:16:46+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-com-secures-australian-financial-service-license-through-acquisition,"Disclosure

Yet bitcoin has actually lagged the surges for some other cryptocurrencies.

While bitcoin has soared 15% in the past week to hit a new all-time high just under $20,000, ethereum -- the second-largest crypto after bitcoin -- is up more than 20% in the past seven days.

Meanwhile XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, has surged nearly 25%. Litecoin, Polkadot, Cardano and Stellar, which are all among the top dozen biggest cryptocurrencies, have enjoyed larger gains than bitcoin, too.

""Part of what's going on is simple math. Smaller coins can have bigger [percentage] moves and there are a lot of other coins that people can invest in,"" said Greg King, CEO of Osprey Funds, a firm that invests in digital currencies.

To that end, bitcoin is significantly larger than other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins.

The current value of all the bitcoin in circulation is about $360 billion. Ethereum's value is just north of $70 billion while XRP's is about $30 billion. Litecoin, the fifth largest, has a value of under $6 billion.

""It makes sense for investors to have a portfolio with bitcoin and ethereum for the long-term and own a basket of some of the rest of the others for trading,"" King said.

Low rates and weaker dollar are bullish for all cryptocurrencies

But these smaller coins are to a certain extent riding the hype that has lifted bitcoin to a new record. Bitcoin has benefited from a weaker dollar and expectations that a prolonged period of super low interest rates will eventually create inflation. That boosts the appeal of a digital currency.

""The explosion in cryptocurrencies is a consequence of the economic environment,"" said Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, a digital asset security firm.

Shaulov added that interest has exploded for so-called stablecoins like Tether and Paxos -- cryptocurrencies that are backed by dollars, euros and other government currencies.

Facebook FB He said the looming launch of the-backed stablecoin Libra, which is in the process of being rebranded as Diem, may also lead to more average consumers using cryptocurrencies.

Investors may also be gravitating to other cryptocurrencies because they fear that bitcoin is becoming too much of a popular momentum trade.

""The one thing I think you will see more and more ... is people understanding that when you only invest in one asset, you have concentration risk,"" said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company that helped launch XRP, in an interview with CNN's Julia Chatterley on Wednesday.

""Diversification matters. Diversification reduces risk,"" Garlinghouse added.

Betting beyond bitcoin

Other experts agree that investors can't bet on just bitcoin.

""I can see a scenario where ethereum can potentially outperform bitcoin over the next year or so. XRP likewise has finally broken out of its downtrend,"" said Rachid Ajaja, CEO and founder of AllianceBlock, in an email to CNN Business.

Though many cryptocurrencies have done well lately, several of them are still well below their peaks — unlike bitcoin. So they may have more room to catch up.

Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at blockchain firm NEM, noted the example of ethereum now trading around $615, more than 50% below its all-time high of above $1,400 from early 2018.

""There has been more demand from mainstream financial mangers about cryptocurrencies, and the big question is what is the relative value for these altcoins compared to bitcoin,"" he said. ""There is probably more upside in ethereum than bitcoin.""

Guy Hirsch, managing director for the US at eToro, a brokerage and trading firm, added that there has been more interest lately for ethereum and XRP as they have gained ""more recognition and credibility.""

Some of the even smaller cryptocurrencies may rally even further. Digital tokens such as VeChain, Terra and Compound have each jumped more than 25% in just the past week.

""All of the big altcoins started as small coins,"" said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, in an email to CNN Business. ""If the crypto market is on an upwards trend, we notice that many smaller investors actually look towards investing in the smaller coins in hopefully hitting the jackpot.""

This could be a healthy sign for the broader cryptocurrency market. It's similar to how stock market investors realize they need to invest in small cap stocks and not just the giant FAANG techs that dominate the S&P 500 and Nasdaq

""There's more to the cryptocurrency market than bitcoin, just like there's the more to the equity market than Apple,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant.",2020-12-03 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/us-dollar-inflation-bitcoin-rally,"Bitcoin’s price has nearly doubled in the past eight weeks as several major publicly listed companies bought the cryptocurrency to hedge against an inflation-led decline in the value of their cash holdings.

Hedging demand for the cryptocurrency may now be set to rise further, with expectations for long-term inflation reaching 19-month highs.

The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, rose to 1.85% on Wednesday. That’s the highest level since May 2019. The metric bottomed out at 0.5% in March, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.

The money supply-boosting policies adopted by the Federal Reserve to counter the coronavirus-induced slowdown have done much to fuel the rise in inflation expectations, as well as the devaluation, or debasement, of the dollar.

The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is seen near 91.00 at press time, a level last seen in April 2018, according to TradingView. The dollar peaked near 103.00 in March.

Such factors typically force both institutions and retail investors to buy traditional store-of-value assets such as gold. This year, institutions have increasingly poured money into bitcoin, strengthening its appeal as an inflation hedge.

“What we’re trying to do is preserve our treasury. The purchasing power of cash is debasing rapidly,” Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy’s chief executive, Michael Saylor, told CoinDesk last month while explaining the rationale behind the company’s decision to buy bitcoin. According to Saylor, bitcoin is a better store of value asset than gold.

Several other firms have turned to bitcoin over the past few months. The trend may well continue, with Morgan Stanley predicting another 10% decline in the dollar over the next 12 months.

Visa has partnered with cryptocurrency startup BlockFi to offer the first rewards credit card that pays out in Bitcoin rather than cash, but is it worth applying for? Unless you’re extremely bullish on cryptocurrency and don’t mind getting seriously dinged for an annual fee, it might be more of a novelty card with limited benefits.

The BlockFi card is not available just yet—there’s a waitlist for existing clients with funded accounts, and the waiting list will be available publicly in January. Cards are expected to ship next spring.



Benefits of the card

Debit cards that allow customers to spend cryptocurrency already exist in the marketplace, but this card is focused on saving. Cardholders earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases that will automatically be converted to B itcoin and placed into a BlockFi account every month. Since you’re depositing into a BlockFi account, it’s regarded as standard crypto funding, and can be withdrawn, traded, earn interest (up to 8.6% APY, according to BlockFi’s website), or used as collateral for crypto-backed loans.



Additionally, as a welcome bonus for the first year, the company is offering $250 converted into B itcoin if you spend $3,000 or more on the card within the first three months.

Downsides to the card



While there has been increasing appetite for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin among bigger U.S. investors, it’s extremely volatile and faces skepticism about the currency’s utility and transferability. Of course, a partnership with Visa pushes crypto more towards more mainstream adoption, but you have to be a true believer in Bitcoin if this card is going to work for you.

The card is also marred by a $200 annual fee, which undercuts the modest 1.5% cash back reward. There are better 1.5% cash back rewards out there, like the Chase Freedom Unlimited or Capital One Quicksilver, which both have a $200 welcome bonus that’s triggered once you spend $500 (compared to BlockFi’s $3,000) and, crucially, no annual fee. You’d really only be getting this card for the Bitcoin features, not any sort of generous rewards.



There are no details about the range for APR rates, either, so it remains to be seen how much monthly interest people will be charged for their balances.

Bottom line

If you’re interested in investing in cryptocurrency, you might be better off using a regular credit card with more easily achieved cash back rewards, and then use that money to buy B itcoin separately.

",,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/bitcoin-family-invested-their-retirement-and-savings-in-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin.html,"Didi Taihuttu, his wife, and three kids bet all they have on bitcoin. In 2017, CNBC spoke to the Dutch family of five when they were in the process of liquidating their assets — from a profitable business and 2,500-square-foot house, to their shoes — and trading it all in for the popular cryptocurrency and a life on the road. Nearly four years and 40 countries later, Taihuttu and his family still don't have bank accounts, a house, or all that much by way of personal possessions. All of the family's savings remain tied up in highly volatile cryptocurrencies. ""We stepped into bitcoin, because we wanted to change our lives,"" said the 42-year-old father of three. When the price of bitcoin collapsed in 2018, Taihuttu added more to his investment portfolio. He says he was always a firm believer that the cryptocurrency was poised for a major rebound. ""I think in this bull cycle, we are going to see a minimal peak of $100,000. I won't be surprised if it hits $200,000 by 2022.""

I won't be surprised if [bitcoin] hits $200,000 by 2022. Didi Taihuttu

The price of bitcoin reached an all-time high on Monday, as it closed in on $20,000. And some analysts say the cryptocurrency still has a lot of room to run higher. Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment firm Galaxy Digital, thinks this comeback rally is only just getting started. He sees bitcoin rising to $60,000 by next year. And Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of CitiFXTechnicals, said the charts signaled that bitcoin could reach $318,000 by December 2021, in a report meant for Citibank's institutional clients and obtained by CNBC.

Why this isn't another bubble

Taihuttu bought the bulk of his bitcoin holdings when it was trading at around $900 in early 2017, just months before it reached nearly $20,000 a coin. Even as bitcoin peaked, the family stayed invested in the cryptocurrency. Once the bubble burst, and the price tumbled down to about $3,000 in early 2018, Taihuttu and his family weren't deterred. ""When bitcoin dipped, we started to buy more."" When I asked Taihuttu on our Skype call whether he was worried that we could be in the midst of another bitcoin bubble, he doubled down on his investment. ""I don't see demand going down,"" he added. ""I think we're headed for a supply crisis.""

Didi Taihuttu

Part of what's different about bitcoin's rally in 2020 versus 2017 is that institutional investors are now adopting bitcoin, lending it newfound legitimacy and helping to erase the reputational risk of investing in the cryptocurrency. ""The 2017 rally was largely driven by retail investors, whereas this year we're seeing a massive influx from corporate entities and institutional money managers,"" said Mati Greenspan, portfolio manager and founder of Quantum Economics.

Old-school, billionaire hedge fund managers Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones now own bitcoin and big fintech players like Square and PayPal are also adding crypto products. This kind of mainstream adoption is hugely important, because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren't backed by an asset, nor do they have the full faith and backing of the government. They're valuable because people believe they're valuable. So it goes a long way when bitcoin gets buy-in from some of the biggest names on Wall Street.

Bitcoin's supply crisis

The surge in interest from mainstream financial players hasn't just reformed bitcoin's image, it's also fomented a supply shortage. ""The basic reason for the two rallies are the same,"" Greenspan said. ""It's a matter of digital scarcity. There is a strictly limited supply of bitcoin available in the market, so when everyone is buying and nobody is selling, it can cause tremendous upward pressure on the price. What's different this time are the players involved."" The 2017 rally was driven by retail speculation, and in 2020, it's the billionaires and corporations that are buying bitcoin en masse. ""When PayPal starts to sell bitcoin to its 350 million users, they also need to buy the bitcoin somewhere,"" said Taihuttu. ""There will be a huge supply crisis, because there won't be enough new bitcoins mined everyday to fulfill the need by huge companies."" And that interest from institutional investors doesn't appear to be slowing down. Six out of 10 investors surveyed by Fidelity in June believe digital assets have a place in investment portfolios.

Schulman noted that PayPal was the first firm to get a conditional BitLicense from regulators in New York—which highlights the firm's dedication to regulatory compliance and could help it long-term as it expands its business into the crypto space. Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency changed its name to Diem and is looking for a fresh start. The Libra Association—now dubbed Diem Association—overlooking the crypto's development hired key executives and announced that it plans to build a safe, secure, and compliant payment system. This comes after the crypto faced partner fallout and regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers last year.

The crypto payments space has been heating up amid the increased focus on digital payments during the coronavirus pandemic. The emphasis on digital payments during the crisis—due in part to the rapid surge in ecommerce—has likely made way for more interest and focus on crypto payments.

And firms have been capitalizing on this emerging space: Square's Cash App crypto service generated $1.63 billion in Bitcoin revenues in Q3. Meanwhile, nearly one-fifth of PayPal users have already traded Bitcoin on the app after the service's US launch last month, according to a study conducted by Mizuho Securities. These offerings could enable players like Visa, Square, and PayPal—which have all become more involved in the crypto space—to diversify their offerings.

But regulatory oversight and compliance remain a barrier to widespread crypto payments usage. The crypto market has been deemed volatile in the past—spurring concern among both consumers and regulators about the use of this payment method. And because it's a relatively new currency, some regulators feel that it could threaten long-standing financial systems. These concerns have led to a call for more safeguards and measures to be put in place regarding usage.

To combat some of these concerns, PayPal invested a tremendous amount in regulatory compliance before its crypto launch, according to Schulman. Working with financial regulators like global central banks could help crypto payment players like Visa and Square make their offerings more appealing to consumers. And collaborating with regulators could benefit Diem, since it might garner more trust from consumers and help it avoid past pitfalls relating to financial regulation.

Cryptocurrencies have been getting quite popular in the Caribbean region and in Antigua and Barbuda, the island has seen significant growth. Crypto adoption has been on the rise in the island country and just recently, a regional news report detailed that more than 40 major businesses are accepting bitcoin cash for goods and services.

During the last few years, a myriad of Caribbean-based island nations are getting into digital currencies. Many Caribbean regions such as Nevis & St Kitts, Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Antigua and Barbuda have become hotspots for blockchain innovation and crypto merchant acceptance.

Two years ago, Antigua’s Minister of Information Technology, Melford Nicholas said “Antigua and Barbuda is determined to be on the cutting edge of the new system of creating wealth.” Moreover, this past spring crypto regulations passed in Antigua’s lower Parliament called the “Digital Assets Business Act 2020,” which applies money laws to custodial providers and crypto exchanges.

On December 2, 2020, a local report from the web portal antiguanewsroom.com explained that cryptocurrency adoption is “making its way across the island of Antigua, bit by bit.” The report notes that over 40 major businesses in Antigua are accepting bitcoin cash (BCH) today.

The article explains that accepting digital currencies has become more prominent throughout the island during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Businesses and individuals who have opted into using [bitcoin cash] BCH have experienced the benefits of instant money transfer with low fees,” the author of the report wrote.

Moreover, the editorial also explains that people can find all the bitcoin cash (BCH) accepting merchants by visiting map.bitcoin.com. At the time of publication, data from map.bitcoin.com shows that there’s a total of 45 bitcoin cash (BCH) accepting businesses on the island country.

Bitcoin.com’s founder Roger Ver has been instrumental toward spreading adoption throughout the region and hopes Antiguans learn more about the economic benefits a peer-to-peer electronic cash system provides.

Companies included on the Antigua merchant acceptance list includes businesses like Sheer Rocks Restaurant, Fort Medieval, The Cool Pool, Creole Antigua Tours, Relocate Antigua, Steph & Vlada’s Studio, Akropolis Greek Restaurant, Gents World, 2M Heavy Enterprises, M & M Service Station, Midtown Car Rental, Thirty Six 5 Beach Bar, The Tailor’s Daughter, Learning Ladder Child Care Centre, North Coast Hardware, and more.

Antigua also has a local Telegram channel called “Antigua Bitcoin Cash and Crypto Trading” where locals can discuss trades and merchant acceptance.

Additionally, bitcoin cash supporters in Antigua have monthly meetups every third Thursday at Hemingways Caribbean Cafe & Restaurant on St. Mary’s Street. Hemingways also accepts BCH for drinks, lunch, and dinner services.

Further, there’s a web portal called payantigua.com that offers educational information for accepting BCH, an introduction to crypto automated teller machines (ATM), information about the Bitcoin Cash Register App, and how to shop with bitcoin cash and save up to 50% on Amazon by leveraging Purse.io.

Management notes that the Company’s vision for commercial returns through its cryptocurrency segment involves a four-phase process. The first phase was about integrating leading design solutions and establishing a supply chain to bring in industry-leading parts and equipment. The second phase was about assembling and shipping its initial unit.

The third phase is now getting underway and targets revenue generation from participation in the Bit5ive Pennsylvania project while simultaneously building a track record for the Proceso S19 Pod5ive Datacenter as a global best-in-class solution for mining facilities around the world. This will include installation and operational launch of tangible mining activities. Phase four will entail bringing the Pod5 solution to the market as a crypto mining equipment product, backed by support from the Company’s Bit5ive partnership and the track record that comes together following the launch of mining activities over the near term.

Destabilizing Act?

Crypto Twitter, like the U.S. Congress, is largely divided between warring factions and in-groups. But for once it looks unified. All it took was a proposed bill to further regulate stablecoin issuers, the so-called STABLE Act.

The Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act would require stablecoin issuers – like Tether, Centre or Diem (formerly Libra) – to apply for federal banking charters, hold minimum Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reserves and register with the Federal Reserve. They would also be required to undergo ongoing analysis of any systemic risk.

In essence, the bill is applying a key component of banking regulation to the emergent stablecoin industry. Dollar-backed stablecoins are a small fraction of global financial activity, though it is a rapidly growing sector. As of October, there were some $20 billion in various programmable dollar analogues floating around the cryptoverse.

A number of high-profile crypto commenters immediately issued public comments lambasting the proposal, introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib and co-sponsored by Reps. Jesús “Chuy” García and Stephen Lynch.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the bill “would represent a huge step backwards” by limiting industry innovation.

“An enormous amount of the innovation brought to the underbanked and small businesses has been driven by non-bank fintech companies, and forcing crypto, fintech and blockchain companies into the enormous regulatory burdens of Federal Reserve and FDIC regulation and supervision is inconsistent with the goals of supporting innovation in the fair and inclusive delivery of payments that comes from stablecoins,” he said in a statement emailed to CoinDesk.

For their part, Tlaib, García and Lynch see the rules as leveling the playing field and could be a key part of creating an inclusive financial ecosystem. The idea is to prevent novel financial instruments from falling into the same exclusionary traps of the banking industry.

Tlaib explained the mission statement in a tweet: “Preventing cryptocurrency providers from repeating the crimes against low- and moderate-income residents of color traditional big banks have is critically important.”

Many in crypto think the proposed law would do just the opposite: By introducing burdensome compliance costs and reifying the power of traditional banks.

The bill overlooks “two core promises of decentralized networks: the chance to put more power in the hands of individual consumers and to catalyze innovation across payments and other financial services,” Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith said in a statement.

“Cryptocurrencies LOWER the cost of servicing populations that have historically been excluded from the banking sector,” Meltem Demirors, CoinShares’ chief strategy officer, tweeted. “Raising costs and compliance obligations forces companies to cut access for unprofitable clientele.”

Despite the pushback, it might be worth wrestling with some of the ideas in the document. The STABLE Act raises questions around what exactly a deposit is, what sorts of obligations issuers have towards their users and the novel regulatory challenges around an industry just getting started. That’s to say nothing of liquidity and credit risks.

“Any entity that wants to issue something that walks and talks like money or like a deposit should be regulated like a depository institution,” Rohan Grey, an assistant professor at the Willamette University College of Law (and an adviser for the bill), told CoinDesk.

To be sure, not all stablecoin issuers are the same – and many make promises about maintaining full, or partial reserves that are difficult to scrutinize.

“What is not clear, however, is whether the word “tethering” in the legislation’s name is a pun on the largest stablecoin, tether – or USDT – which is not otherwise mentioned in the congressmembers’ press release,” Modern Consensus Editor in Chief Leo Jakobson wrote.

Hedge, edge

A weakening dollar bodes well for bitcoin. The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, rose to its highest levels since May 2019 on Wednesday, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Growing fears of inflation typically drive both institutions and retail investors into store-of-value assets. Traditionally this has been gold, but this year, people are making their hedges with bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price has nearly doubled in the past eight weeks, and this may continue, as hedging demand for the cryptocurrency may now be set to rise further.

Dow’s data

S&P Dow Jones Indices will launch a customizable cryptocurrency indexing service in partnership with crypto tax service Lukka in 2021. In a press release announcing the product on Wednesday, Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted surging institutional interest for decent crypto pricing data. “With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” he said.

Fee-less ETF

Switzerland-based Valour has launched what it claims is the first bitcoin exchange–traded product (ETP) without management fees. Listed on the Stockholm-based Nordic Growth Market, the Bitcoin Zero ETP brings investors exposure to bitcoin in a similar way to exchange-traded funds and shares. The ETP structure is a type of security with a value derived from other investment vehicles – such as currencies, commodities or, in this case, bitcoin – to which it is benchmarked.

Staying or going?

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appears to have walked back comments made about relocating his San Francisco-based payments firm. Six weeks ago, Garlinghouse floated the move, citing a lack of clarity about XRP’s legal status, the cryptocurrency at the heart of its payments operation, and a number of private investor lawsuits claiming said crypto is an unregistered security. Other countries, he said, had more favorable regulatory environments. Now he’s waiting to see what impact an in-coming Biden administration would mean for the startup. Ripple is reportedly eyeing an initial public offering.

Decentralized streaming

Theta Labs is moving forward with its vision of democratizing content delivery with the beta release of its decentralized video streaming platform. Announced Thursday, the Theta Edgecast platform aims to reward its users while lowering cost of video content delivery by using a distributed network. Edgecast is a decentralized application (dapp) built on Theta’s peer-to-peer video blockchain technology, powered by the Theta Edge Network. According to the announcement, the network currently consists of over 2,690 nodes worldwide.

Kraken will fund open-source Ethereum development through Gitcoin. In a first for the exchange, Kraken will match up to $150,000 in donations made in Gitcoin’s “Ethereum Infrastructure Tech” category in the eighth round of Gitcoin Grants. Gitcoin maintains an Ethereum-based marketplace to connect developers and donors, crowdfund fundraising and provide opportunities for builders to generate relationships and contribute to projects – all in an attempt to advance open-source tech infrastructure.

Yet bitcoin has actually lagged the surges for some other cryptocurrencies.

While bitcoin has soared 15% in the past week to hit a new all-time high just under $20,000, ethereum — the second-largest crypto after bitcoin — is up more than 20% in the past seven days.

Meanwhile XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, has surged nearly 25%. Litecoin, Polkadot, Cardano and Stellar, which are all among the top dozen biggest cryptocurrencies, have enjoyed larger gains than bitcoin, too.

“Part of what’s going on is simple math. Smaller coins can have bigger [percentage] moves and there are a lot of other coins that people can invest in,” said Greg King, CEO of Osprey Funds, a firm that invests in digital currencies.

To that end, bitcoin is significantly larger than other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins.

The current value of all the bitcoin in circulation is about $360 billion. Ethereum’s value is just north of $70 billion while XRP’s is about $30 billion. Litecoin, the fifth largest, has a value of under $6 billion.

“It makes sense for investors to have a portfolio with bitcoin and ethereum for the long-term and own a basket of some of the rest of the others for trading,” King said.

Low rates and weaker dollar are bullish for all cryptocurrencies

But these smaller coins are to a certain extent riding the hype that has lifted bitcoin to a new record. Bitcoin has benefited from a weaker dollar and expectations that a prolonged period of super low interest rates will eventually create inflation. That boosts the appeal of a digital currency.

“The explosion in cryptocurrencies is a consequence of the economic environment,” said Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, a digital asset security firm.

Shaulov added that interest has exploded for so-called stablecoins like Tether and Paxos — cryptocurrencies that are backed by dollars, euros and other government currencies.

He said the looming launch of the Facebook-backed stablecoin Libra, which is in the process of being rebranded as Diem, may also lead to more average consumers using cryptocurrencies.

Investors may also be gravitating to other cryptocurrencies because they fear that bitcoin is becoming too much of a popular momentum trade.

“The one thing I think you will see more and more … is people understanding that when you only invest in one asset, you have concentration risk,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company that helped launch XRP, in an interview with CNN’s Julia Chatterley on Wednesday.

“Diversification matters. Diversification reduces risk,” Garlinghouse added.

Betting beyond bitcoin

Other experts agree that investors can’t bet on just bitcoin.

“I can see a scenario where ethereum can potentially outperform bitcoin over the next year or so. XRP likewise has finally broken out of its downtrend,” said Rachid Ajaja, CEO and founder of AllianceBlock, in an email to CNN Business.

Though many cryptocurrencies have done well lately, several of them are still well below their peaks — unlike bitcoin. So they may have more room to catch up.

Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at blockchain firm NEM, noted the example of ethereum now trading around $615, more than 50% below its all-time high of above $1,400 from early 2018.

“There has been more demand from mainstream financial mangers about cryptocurrencies, and the big question is what is the relative value for these altcoins compared to bitcoin,” he said. “There is probably more upside in ethereum than bitcoin.”

Guy Hirsch, managing director for the US at eToro, a brokerage and trading firm, added that there has been more interest lately for ethereum and XRP as they have gained “more recognition and credibility.”

Some of the even smaller cryptocurrencies may rally even further. Digital tokens such as VeChain, Terra and Compound have each jumped more than 25% in just the past week.

“All of the big altcoins started as small coins,” said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, in an email to CNN Business. “If the crypto market is on an upwards trend, we notice that many smaller investors actually look towards investing in the smaller coins in hopefully hitting the jackpot.”

This could be a healthy sign for the broader cryptocurrency market. It’s similar to how stock market investors realize they need to invest in small cap stocks and not just the giant FAANG techs that dominate the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

“There’s more to the cryptocurrency market than bitcoin, just like there’s the more to the equity market than Apple,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant.",2020-12-04 00:00:00,https://www.cityam.com/the-bitcoin-crypto-bull-run-is-just-getting-started/,"Bitcoin has undoubtedly had an amazing week having made new all time highs on the largest bitcoin exchange by way of volume CME Group. The fact Bitcoin did not make a new all time high on retail exchanges and only on institutional trading platforms like CME points to who is really driving this bull run and why the Bitcoin bull run in my opinion is just getting going.

This week we have had record institutional volume coming from institutions as CME surpassed OKEX as the largest crypto derivatives platform. This recent surge in volume has been caused by a lack of trading on Thanksgiving last week causing a slow end to the week followed by major news events such as the Guggenheim Partners $295 billion investment fund making a $500m investment into Grayscales GBTC, and of course the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0 bringing new eyes onto the crypto market as people really begin to understand that crypto is not fairy dust but in fact it is real, with real world value.

So all of this begs the question, what comes next? Well as a Cryptocurrency Trader and market analyst, from my perspective Bitcoin is far from done with its almighty rise yet. In fact I believe that we are just at the start of this bull run. This week Bitcoin made the significant move of breaking the high set last week and thus continuing the bullish trend.

Since making its new high at 11am on December 1st, the price of bitcoin has been consolidating between the $18,500-$19,500 level as we experienced large amounts of volatility that made for a great start to the week’s trading. Since this point as the volatility has reduced and the price has consolidated to the upside.

Going forward into the weekend Bitcoin will more than likely continue this consolidation period causing attentions to fade on bitcoin as institutions take the weekend off. Much of the attention will more than likely divert back to the Altcoin space that has consistently every weekend recently experienced huge price increases on most altcoins.

I trade Altcoins just as frequently as I trade Bitcoin because due to the increased volatility they experience I find just holding Altcoins in a bull market to be preferable to holding any stablecoin alternative. With the launch of Ethereum 2.0 this week there has been a lot more eyes on the Altcoin space and more will follow, Ethereum 2.0 will not cause the prices of everything to go to the moon overnight.

The updated protocol will have a delayed price effect as applications like coinbase safely install the staking functionality within their app. This will allow holders of 32 Ethereum or more to stake in a coinbase wallet and earn passive income on their holdings. You can stake without going via a centralised exchange like coinbase but most users of cryptocurrency generally avoid anything complex such as depositing into the Ethereum deposit contract for fear of losing funds. There are currently 1,003,906 Ethereum in the Ethereum deposit contract proving that people are adopting ETH 2.0 but not on a mass scale with that being approximately 1/113 of the total supply of ethereum.

When staking ethereum becomes more accessible to the every day cryptocurrency holder, this is when I expect the price of ethereum to go crazy, much like the price of bitcoin started to go crazy when institutional demand began to outpace supply on a grand scale. We are simply waiting for the balance to tip and the new tokenomics model to kick in, when the number of staked ethereum rises, the volatility on the markets will increase due to a reduced amount of liquidity making small buy orders more powerful and thus the balance will tip in favour of demand outpacing supply due to the passive income that can be earned from staking.

So going forward into the next week, what do I expect to happen? After Bitcoin completes its daily close today I expect a fairly slow weekend followed by a bullish breakout next week by all cryptocurrencies. Buying power is far larger than selling pressure at the moment, Grayscale added over 7,000 Bitcoin to their trust just this week. I believe if Bitcoin drops below $18,200 then we will close the CME gap that formed at $16,925 but any kind of dip would be short lived as institutions just cannot get enough bitcoin at the moment! If Bitcoin breaks above $19,625 then we will more than likely head in for a retest of the all time high, and third time lucky we should break through!

Bitcoin witnessed a strong 10.6% price surge this past week as the cryptocurrency is trading at $19,000. It had recovered from the $17,186 level last Friday and started to push higher over the weekend. The coin went on to scratch the previous ATH level of $19,907 (Coinbase price) on Monday.

Unfortunately, it turned away from the ATH and headed lower on Tuesday into the $18,330 support (.236 Fib Retracement). It has since bounced higher to re-test the ATH-day closing price at $19,646 but could not break there and dropped to $19,000 today.

Looking ahead, if the buyers can hold $19,000 and push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $19,656 (ATH-day closing price). The ATH price follows this at $19,907. Above it, resistance lies at $20,000, $20509, $20,881, $21,000, and $21,162.

On the other side, if the sellers push beneath $19,000, support lies at $18,330 (.236 Fib), $18,999, $17,186 (2018 Highs), and $16,567 (.5 Fib Retracement).

Ethereum

Ethereum witnessed a solid 13.2% price hike this week as it currently trades at $586. The coin had rebounded from the support at $520 last Friday as it surged into the resistance at $620 again this week.

ETH made two attempts to break the resistance at $620 and failed on both occasions. It has since dropped to trade at around $585 today.

Looking ahead, if the sellers break $585, the first level of support lies at $560 (.236 Fib). Beneath this, support lies at $550, $524 (.382 Fib), and $500.

On the other side, the first level of resistance now lies at $600. Above this, resistance lies at $620 (1.414 Fib Extension), $650, $665, and $675 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement).

Against Bitcoin, Ethereum managed to rebound from the support at 0.03 BTC (.5 Fib) last Friday as it pushed higher to reach the 0.032 BTC resistance. During the December period so far, Etheruem has been rangebound between 0.032 BTC and 0.0308 BTC and must break this range to dictate the market’s next direction.

Looking ahead, if the bulls push higher, the first level of resistance to break lies at 0.032 BTC. Above this, resistance lies at 0.033 BTC, 0.0337 BTC (March 2018 Support), and 0.035 BTC.

Ripple saw a smaller 7.6% price hike over the past week but dropped by a steel 10% over the past 24 hours as it trades at $0.55 (2019 Highs). The coin attempted to push higher during the week after rebounding from $0.5 last Friday.

It managed to break as high as $0.67 but was unable to close a daily candle above here. Yesterday, it met resistance at $0.648 (bearish .786 Fib) and rolled over to hit the $0.556 support today.

Moving forward, if the sellers break the 2019 highs at $0.556, the first level of support lies at $0.5 (.5 Fib). Beneath this, support lies at $0.435 (.618 Fib), $0.4, and $0.35.

On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at $0.6. This is followed by $0.648 (bearish .786 Fib), $0.68, $0.718 (bearish .886 Fib), and $0.75.

XRP has started to head lower again against Bitcoin this week. The coin started the week by trading near the 3600 SAT level but has since dropped to 3000 SAT. Today, it broke beneath crucial support at 3220 SAT (.382 Fib) to hit 3000 SAT.

Looking ahead, if the sellers break 3000 SAT, the first level of support lies at 2900 SAT (.5 Fib). Beneath this, support is found at 2585 SAT (.618 Fib), 2450 SAT, and 2200 SAT.

Alternatively, the first level of resistance lies at 3200 SAT. Above this, resistance is found at 3360 SAT, 3600 SAT, and 3785 SAT (October 2019 highs).

Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash saw a small 6.3% price hike this week as the coin trades at the $289.50 level. It had rebounded from the support around $260 last Friday and managed to surge as high as $318.90 on Monday – where it met resistance at a bearish .5 Fib Retracement.

From there, BCH has dropped lower over the past few days to break beneath $300 and trade around $390.

Looking ahead, if the selling continues, the first level of support lies at $280. Beneath this, $270 (.786 Fib), $256 (.886 Fib), and $240.

On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at $300. Above this, $318.90 (bearish .5 Fib), $341 (1.272 Fib Extension), and $351 (March High-Day Closing Price).

Against Bitcoin, BCH dropped lower from 0.016 BTC to reach the current support at 0.0148 (.786 Fib Retracement). The cryptocurrency had rebounded from 0.013 BTC earlier in November but was never able to break the resistance at 0.02 BTC – provided by the 100-days EMA.

From there, BCH has been falling against Bitcoin to reach the current 0.0148 BTC support.

Looking ahead, if the sellers push beneath 0.0148 BTC, the first level of support lies at 0.0142 BTC (.886 Fib). This is followed by 0.014 BTC, 0.0136 BTC, and 0.013.

On the other side, resistance is first expected at 0.016 BTC. This is followed by resistance at 0.017 BTC (bearish .236 Fib), 0.018 BTC, and 0.0191 BTC (bearish .382 FIb and 100-days EMA).

Litecoin

Litecoin saw a robust 17.5% price hike this week as it trades at the $83.10 level. The cryptocurrency rebounded from $69 last week as it started to push higher. By Tuesday, it had reached the resistance at $89.35 (1.618 Fib Extension). The coin had attempted to break this resistance during November but failed to overcome the level.

The same thing happened this week when Litecoin re-attempted to break $89.35. The buyers were unable to close a daily candle above the resistance, which caused it to roll over and reach the current $83.10 level.

Moving forward, if the sellers drop the price lower, the first level of support lies at $80. Beneath this, $77.75 (.382 Fib), $72.65 (.5 Fib), a rising trend line, and $69 will provide support.

On the other side, resistance lies at $84.22. Above this, resistance is found at $89.35, $96, $100, and $101.

Against Bitcoin, Litecoin had surged higher from 0.004 BTC last week as it broke above the 100-days EMA to reach the resistance at 0.00462 BTC (bearish .5 Fib Retracement). It was unable to break above this level yesterday, which caused the coin to roll over and drop into the 0.00445 BTC level.

Looking ahead, if the sellers drive lower, the first level of support lies at 0.0044 BTC (100-days EMA). This is followed by 0.00434 BTC (.5 Fib), 0.00417 BTC (.618 Fib), and 0.004 BTC.

On the other side, resistance is first expected at 0.00462 BTC.

Key Takeaways Paul Tudor Jones has expressed his positive views about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.

The American finance tycoon likened Bitcoin and Ethereum to precious and industrial metals.

He also pondered the idea of digital currencies replacing cash in the future.

Share this article

Speaking to Yahoo! Finance, Paul Tudor Jones, one of the world’s most celebrated investors, shared his long-term viewpoint on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.

Jones said that he thought Bitcoin had the “wrong market cap” in comparison to equities and fiat currencies, suggesting that he believes in the number one crypto’s growth potential.

He then mentioned Ethereum and Tether as two other prominent cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the “Metals Complex”

He added that he thinks the crypto space will be “a lot like the metals complex.” That is to say, Bitcoin would represent a precious metal such as gold, owing to its digital scarcity and legacy as the first crypto.

Other cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, could be more akin to industrial metals like “copper, platinum, and palladium.”

The comparison isn’t an entirely new perspective: Bitcoin has often been referred to as a form of digital gold, not least this year.

Equally, Jones’ mention of usable industrial metals is arguably a fitting description for an asset like ETH. Users of the Ethereum blockchain need to spend ETH to interact with the network’s programmable smart contracts, but the currency also has use cases outside of powering the network.

Where Bitcoin represents a form of store-of-value like gold, ETH could prove to be more similar to a multi-purpose metal like platinum.

Jones went on to say that the crypto space recalls the Internet stock landscape of the late 90s. The growth of the World Wide Web famously fuelled a wave of speculative mania for Internet-related stocks at the turn of the millennium, resulting in a boom-and-bust market cycle known as the “Dot-com bubble.”

Jones said that he thinks a similar scenario could play out in the cryptocurrency space, with only a few projects likely to survive long-term.

He also said that digital currencies are likely to see widespread adoption over the next two decades, and that “cash may be gone.” He concluded by saying that he will “assume the path forward is north,” in reference to the price of cryptocurrencies.

Jones surprised the crypto community when he turned bullish on Bitcoin earlier this year. He said at the time that BTC represents 1-2% of his investment portfolio.

Jones is considered a legendary figure in the finance world. His net worth is estimated at $5.8 billion.

Music and podcast streaming service Spotify posted a job offer that woke up interest in the crypto community, as it’s related to supporting cryptocurrencies for payments on the music platform, potentially.

Spotify Is Treading Crypto Waters With a New Job Listing

According to the job listing published on the talent acquisition platform Lever, the company is looking for an “Associate Director, Payments Strategy & Innovation” who is expected to bring in new payment strategies.

The description of the job role, based in their London offices, details:

This role will report to the Director, Payments Strategy & Innovation and will play a key part in defining and implementing Spotify’s payments strategy as well as leading Spotify’s activity within the Libra stablecoin project and wider digital asset & cryptocurrency space.

The music streaming service giant explains that the director should look for new opportunities in the “emerging ecosystem” of distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchains, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and other digital assets.

Interestingly, Spotify stresses the company’s need to lead their engagement in the “day-to-day” with the Libra Association.

Other streaming services have been showing an increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, such as Twitch, as the live-streaming company has encouraged people during 2020 to pay their subscription via crypto by offering special discounts.

The platform currently uses an Atlanta-based crypto firm, Bitpay, which allows payments in bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum (ETH), four USD-pegged stablecoins (GUSD, USDC, PAX, and BUSD), and ripple (XRP).

In Pakistan, a provincial government has passed a draft resolution on December 2, 2020, that demands the federal government to take steps towards legalizing both cryptocurrencies and crypto-mining activities.

A Crypto-Friendly Draft Resolution Approval Sets a Precedent in Pakistan

The Provincial Assembly (MPA) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of the four provinces in the country, made the official announcement after holding discussions in the midst of a nationwide dialogue about if the federal government should legalize crypto assets and take it out from the limbo.

Dr. Sumera Shams, a member of the Provincial Assembly, said in a tweet that he expects Pakistan could progress towards digitalization “to compete for the world.”

He also praised the assistance of Zia Ullah Bangash – Advisor to Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Science & Technology and Information Technology – and Fawad Hussain, Federal Minister for Science & Technology Government of Pakistan, in the writing of the draft resolution.

No Ban on Cryptocurrencies in Pakistan

Although there is no ban on crypto-related activities in Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan has published warnings in 2018 that advise people and businesses to exercise caution on dealing with cryptocurrencies because of its “extreme volatility.”

But Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is not the only active province in terms of working with crypto-friendly bills. National TV host Waqar Zaka, known for his activism in favor of crypto in the country, claimed in a tweet published on December 2, 2020, that he’s going to travel to Punjab and Baluchistan to help with similar bills.

On November 15, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) published a position paper on the regulation of cryptocurrency trading platforms. The document confirmed that their warnings didn’t mean a ban on bitcoin (BTC) or any other crypto assets in the country.

The consultation paper is focused exclusively on non-government or non-central bank issued crypto assets and not on central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

(BLK) CEO Larry Fink referred to Bitcoin (BTCUSD) as an ""index of money laundering."" Three years later, he seems to have changed his mind about the cryptocurrency.

During a conversation with the Council of Foreign Relations earlier this week, Fink said that Bitcoin could evolve into a ""global market"" because it had caught the ""attention and imagination"" of Millennials. ""We look at it as something that's real,"" he said in the YouTube event, which also featured former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. According to Fink, Bitcoin could threaten the U.S. dollar's reserve status in international markets and make it ""less relevant.""

Key Takeaways In an about-face from his 2017 stance, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says Bitcoin has the potential to evolve into a ""global market"" and threaten the U.S. dollar's status as a reserve currency.

Fink joins a growing list of institutional investors commenting on Bitcoin.

Developments in cryptocurrency markets and infrastructure are responsible for investors taking a second look at cryptocurrencies.

Even as he outlined the cryptocurrency's potential to upend traditional finance, Fink also highlighted drawbacks in its current market. ""It is a sin market,"" he said, referring to the use of Bitcoin by criminals for money laundering and other nefarious activities. Fink also pointed to the thin liquidity that characterizes Bitcoin trading markets and result in wild price swings. ""[Bitcoin is] still untested. You see these big giant moves every day,"" he said.

Why Have Fink's Views on Crypto Evolved?

Fink's comments on Bitcoin are part of a broader reassessment of Bitcoin's potential in recent months. Fink's colleague, BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder, told news network CNBC that cryptocurrencies were ""here to stay"" and surmised that they could take the place of gold. ""It [cryptocurrency] is so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,"" he said, alluding to the tracking made possible through a cryptocurrency's blockchain. Other well-known investors have also chimed in with positive assessments.

To a major extent, these evaluations are driven by a change in circumstances. When Fink made his comments on Bitcoin in 2017, the cryptocurrency was on the cusp of a price trajectory that culminated in a record price. Various post mortems and assessments blame speculation for driving price upwards. As its infrastructure crumbled under the weight of investor expectation, the cryptocurrency's price subsequently witnessed a prolonged slump last year.

Since then, the infrastructure for cryptocurrencies has been bolstered by technical developments, such as the Lightning Network, which enables transactions to take place off the main network, thereby reducing wait times, and launch of companies like Bakkt, a derivatives platform for cryptocurrencies that could increase liquidity and participants in crypto markets. Regulators are also increasingly beginning to clarify their stance on cryptocurrencies.

The recent trickle of institutional investors could turn into a flood once BlackRock moves into Bitcoin. But it will take some work.

In 2018, during an interview with Bloomberg, Fink said that BlackRock was waiting for cryptocurrencies to be ""legitimatized."" The CEO continued, ""…when you have the true open nature of it [cryptocurrency blockchains] that you identify who the players are on both sides, that's when we will look at it as an alternative to other currencies,"" he said.",2020-12-04 21:49:30.348000+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/member-squad-takes-cryptocurrency/,"Last year, when Facebook officials were hauled in front of Congress to defend their plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra, they arrived with a pitch about financial inclusion. With Libra, people anywhere in the world would have access to a common payment network, they said, whether or not they had access to a bank. All it would take was a phone and a Facebook account.

Representative Rashida Tlaib, (D–Michigan) a member of the “squad” of progressive first-term lawmakers, had heard similar pitches before. Her Detroit district, the third-poorest in the country, is populated with the very unbanked people Facebook executives were describing. In the past, they had been promised faster tax returns, paycheck advances, or check cashing without a checking account. But these offerings came with little regulation, and often with excessive fees or interest rates. Now, here was Libra, a cryptocurrency that also seemed poised to fall through the regulatory cracks, backed by an industry with a lot of power and data. She wondered if this was the next iteration.

“People don’t realize that this is coming. I feel like a mama bear, and I have to watch out for what is coming for my district and my neighborhood,” Tlaib says. That’s why she wants to talk with you about a thing called stablecoins.

Not familiar? Eyes glazing? It’s a bit niche, for now. Stablecoins are a form of digital currency that, as the name suggests, hold a constant value. That’s what Libra is, technically, but there are many other flavors. Stablecoins might be backed by an actual currency or a basket of assets, or they might use algorithmic tricks to hold steady, but the point is that their price in, say, dollars, doesn’t change. It’s a promise. Stablecoins were initially used to help with buying and selling volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But increasingly, some stablecoins, like Libra, have been proposed for more common uses, like paying for actual stuff. That’s because they can be fast, easy to use on phones, and are, well, stable.

“I feel like a mama bear, and I have to watch out for what is coming for my district and my neighborhood.” Representative Rashida Tlaib (D–Michigan)

The problem is that stablecoins are not much more familiar to members of Congress and regulators than they are to you and me. In the Facebook hearings last year, everyone seemed to want Libra to be regulated, but the unanswered question was how. So this week, Tlaib introduced a bill, cosponsored by representatives Stephen Lynch (D–Massachusetts) and Chuy Garcia (D–Illinois), that offers a possible solution: requiring stablecoins that promise a fixed value in US dollars to be issued by banks. That, the legislators argue, constitutes taking a deposit, which is something only banks can do—not tech companies nor the associations they set up to issue coins on their behalf.

That logic takes aim squarely at Facebook’s stablecoin plans. This year, while we were worrying over social distancing and reproduction values, Libra went through major changes. Instead of a global, borderless coin backed by a number of currencies and assets, it’s now proposed as a series of coins for different places: a coin for Europe denominated in euros, a coin for the United States denominated in dollars, and so on. That’s given some relief to central bankers who were concerned that Facebook's currency would compete with their ability to control the local money supply. Libra also abandoned a plan to eventually let anyone build services on its network, a feature that raised money laundering concerns, in favor of a closed system controlled by its official members.

Oh, and there were a few naming tweaks along the way. Facebook’s Calibra division, which is designing the company’s Libra wallet, now wants to be called Novi. And earlier this week, Libra itself—both the currency and the association that issues it—became Diem. Got that? Novi deals Diem. Think of it as an effort to assert the project’s independence from Facebook—though, as a reminder, the company did come up with the idea, built most of the technology, set up the association with close allies, and will likely provide by far the most users for whatever coins are eventually issued.",

The Taihuttus, however, were not deterred. The Dutch family of five parked their bitcoin-branded VW California T6 camper van on the shoulder of the D.100 state highway, determined to find a way to pay for their passage with the cryptocurrency. For four years, the family has subsisted on bitcoin alone. After liquidating their assets, from their retirement accounts and cars, to their clothes and toys, they bet it all on the volatile cryptocurrency, back when it was $900 a coin in 2017. They also made a vow to never pay for another service or good ever again, unless the transaction was somehow made in bitcoin. ""We waited until we found a person who was willing to accept bitcoin,"" said Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called Bitcoin Family.

After educating this traveler about the merits of the cryptocurrency, they installed a bitcoin wallet on his phone and made an exchange of bitcoin for cash. ""With the cash, we bought our visas,"" continued Taihuttu. ""It led to some yelling inside the car. I can tell you that my wife and my kids were not happy. But if you try to live the bitcoin life, you have your ups and downs.""

The most bitcoin-friendly cities on the planet

Since the Taihuttus went all in on bitcoin in 2017, they have traveled to forty countries. Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies over the past few years has made it easier for the family to transact solely in bitcoin, but to get by, they have had to get creative. Through a combination of bartering, bargaining, bitcoin debit cards, and convincing vendors to accept the cryptocurrency, the family has managed to traverse much of Europe, Asia, and Oceania. But they say there are two places on the planet where you can pay for literally everything using bitcoin: the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana and a small Italian village called Rovereto. In Ljubljana, they paid for things like car repairs and cinema tickets in the cryptocurrency, and in Rovereto, it is possible to buy a motorbike, pay your taxes, or get a haircut using bitcoin.

Taihuttu family in Rome

""I always said to people, 'I'm never going to cut my hair till I find a hairdresser that accepts bitcoin,'"" said Taihuttu. ""And then I walked into this hairdresser, and he was accepting bitcoin. I was like, 'Oh, no, I need to cut my hair!'"" For Didi, the fact that both a very small traditional village and the capital of a country had whole-heartedly embraced bitcoin was a sign to him that it was possible anywhere. ""In my opinion, any country, any city in the world, can have the same adoption of bitcoin as a store of value, or payment, or peer-to-peer cash,"" explained Taihuttu. ""This is what keeps driving us to explore the world.""

Spending vs. sitting on your bitcoin

The price of bitcoin reached an all-time high on Monday, as it closed in on $20,000, and some analysts say the cryptocurrency still has a lot of room to run higher. Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment firm Galaxy Digital, thinks this comeback rally is only just getting started. He sees bitcoin rising to $60,000 by next year. Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of CitiFXTechnicals, said the charts signaled that bitcoin could reach $318,000 by December 2021, in a report meant for Citibank's institutional clients and obtained by CNBC.



With these sky-high predictions, it is not surprising that more investors are choosing to store their bitcoin, rather than spend it.

If you try to live the bitcoin life, you have your ups and downs. Didi Taihuttu

The number of accounts buying more than a million dollars worth of bitcoin and then moving it off the exchanges is up 180% from 2017 to 2020, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain forensics firm. And data from Glassnode shows that 95% of bitcoin's market capitalization is held in wallets that hold more than one bitcoin. Data points such as these also point to the fact that wealthier investors are getting their skin in the game. 2017's bitcoin rally was largely led by retail speculation, but in 2020, it is the billionaires and corporations that are buying bitcoin in bulk, and in some cases, moving it offline for security. ""I am seeing much more interest [in bitcoin] this year than in 2017,"" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, founder and president of Bone Fide Wealth. ""It's not a buzzword anymore. It's proving more and more to be a legitimate asset by both investors and institutions.""

Is it a currency or a commodity?

As more investors choose to hold onto their bitcoin, it begs the question: Is bitcoin a currency or a commodity? It can be used to buy, sell, and price goods, and big fintech players like PayPal now allow users to pay for purchases with bitcoin.

An SEC filing dated Dec. 4 revealed that Microstrategy purchased another 2,574 Bitcoin for an average price of $19,427. The company holds the most Bitcoin for a publicly-traded company.

Microstrategy Goes All-In on Bitcoin

The software firm had made two Bitcoin purchases before this. The first investment of $250 million occurred on Aug. 11, followed by an additional $175 million a month later.

At the end of September, the company had assets worth $773 million in total, with 54.9% of its Bitcoin holdings. The value of their BTC holdings has appreciated by 194%.

The latest purchase has increased Microstrategy’s asset in Bitcoin by nearly 60%.

Microstrategy’s stock (MSTR) has also soared 165% since August when the company first began adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

Micheal Saylor, the CEO of Microstrategy, sees Bitcoin as an ideal hedge against the inflation in cash reserves. Saylor argued that while currency inflation is zero, asset inflation has risen 15%, promoting a disconnect between asset prices, like equities, and actual earnings.

Microstrategy now holds approximately 40,824 BTC. Its investment is nearly three times more than Galaxy Digital Holdings in second place.

A study revealed that darknet markets have astonishing figures so far in 2020, despite the coronavirus pandemic, but the dynamics changed compared to the last year’s numbers.

Darknet Vendors Surpassed $800 Million in Revenues Despite Covid Pandemic

According to the Chainalysis report, darknet marketplaces surpassed the $800 million threshold worth of cryptocurrencies in revenue made in 2019, the all-time high. However, the exact figures for 2020 will be released in the “Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report” in January 2021.

However, the research firm noted that the overall number of purchases and customers fell significantly, but those with higher values, boosting the rally highlighted in the study. The most used cryptocurrencies in the transactions have been bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (bch), litecoin (LTC), and tether (USDT).

Also, the number of active markets has declined in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis globally. Chainalysis explains that the pandemic could be the main reason behind such dynamics in this year’s trend across the darknet markets, but according to experts consulted for the research, there are other reasons:

It appears that ever-increasing competition combined with the efforts of law enforcement are causing the darknet market ecosystem to consolidate to a few big players — a pattern common to the technology industry and other markets, both legal and illegal.

Dynamics in Bitcoin Prices

Chainalysis found that darknet market activity seemed to be “impervious” to bitcoin market activity until this point of the study. They explained further on the matter:

Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value, which have always been common, rarely appeared to play a role in darknet market consumers’ purchasing activity. However, when Bitcoin’s price began to fall in mid-March following the first round of U.S. lockdowns, so too did darknet market activity.

But according to the research firm, people should expect that such a change would prove only to be temporary.

Some of the sellers who spoke with Chainalysis for the research blamed the pandemic because it affected their operations. One example is the increasing number of customer complaints due to the delay in the deliveries, and similar situations forced some marketplaces to close temporarily.

Is this the beginning of the new normality in the darknet marketplaces? Let us know in the comments section below.

The first quarter was nothing short of a dumpster fire, with concerns surrounding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic pummeling equities. Comparatively, the subsequent eight months have featured a nearly unstoppable rally. When 2020 does come to a close, the benchmark S&P 500 may wind up delivering pretty normal gains (based on its long-term average) for investors.

But this hasn't been the case for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. A shift in sentiment catapulted the largest digital token on the planet to a record high this past week, putting it within a stone's throw of eclipsing $20,000. On a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is up 161%, through Dec. 1, 2020. That's approximately a 150 percentage-point outperformance of the S&P 500.

Yet you won't find this Foolish investor buying into the bitcoin hype now or potentially ever. That's because I view bitcoin as having a number of fundamental flaws.

For example, bitcoin is often touted for its scarcity, much like gold. However, there's a big difference between a commodity having physical scarcity and a digital token having scarcity because of how its computer code was written. We can't create more gold than what we can mine on Earth. By comparison, the crypto community can, in theory, change the code governing bitcoin's 21 million token hard cap. In other words, it's perceived scarcity and not actual scarcity.

The bigger beef I have with bitcoin is the token's limited utility. Even if it were to hit $20,000, giving its mined supply a value of $371.2 billion, this wouldn't even remotely come close to having game-changing transactional potential. Roughly 40% of the 18.56 million mined bitcoin are being held tightly by investors and aren't in circulation. This leaves maybe $223 billion worth of bitcoin in circulation for payments. That's about one-quarter of 1 percent of global gross domestic product for 2017.

I don't even agree with the premise of buying digital tokens. The real value of the crypto revolution is the underlying blockchain technology. Buying bitcoin gives investors zero ownership in the underlying digital ledger that's fueled cryptocurrency hype for the past decade.

Personally, I'd rather buy the following three hypergrowth stocks than own bitcoin.

Square

Interestingly, one of the three fast-growing stocks that I believe can run circles around bitcoin is actually a company that's been generating big-time revenue from the most popular cryptocurrency -- Square (NYSE:SQ).

For close to a decade, Square has operated as a payment facilitator for small businesses. The company's seller ecosystem provides point-of-sale solutions and analytic tools to help these smaller businesses thrive. Since this is a merchant fee-driven operating segment, seeing gross payment volume (GPV) soar from $6.5 billion to $106.2 billion between 2012 and 2019 has led to serious sales and gross profit growth in this segment.

What's noteworthy about the seller ecosystem is that it's been drawing in larger businesses, based on annualized GPV, over the past couple of years. If bigger merchants adopt Square's seller platform, the company's already impressive growth rate could be adjusted even higher.

However, the real lure for investors is peer-to-peer payment platform Cash App. The monthly active user count for Cash App more than quadrupled to 30 million between the end of 2017 and June 2020, with approximately 7 million users adopting Cash Card (a debit card that links to a user's Cash App account). Cash App gives Square the ability to generate revenue from merchant fees, bank transfers, investments, and (drum roll) bitcoin exchange. In fact, Square purchased $50 million worth of bitcoin this year to help facilitate this rapidly expanding area of its business.

The point is, Square allows investors to take advantage of the hype surrounding bitcoin without being directly exposed to a potentially flawed token.

Fastly

Another hypergrowth stock that I'd much rather buy instead of bitcoin is edge cloud-computing company Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). Fastly helps deliver content quickly and securely to end users for its clients.

Despite losing 40% of its value since reaching an all-time high in mid-October, Fastly's stock has still more than quadrupled in value since the year began. This fourth-quarter tumble is associated with the company revising its third-quarter sales guidance on account of reduced usage by TikTok, Fastly's largest customer (12% of total first-half revenue). This revenue revision also came after the Trump administration threatened to block downloads of TikTok stateside.

Though deleveraging its sales from TikTok might sound like bad news, it's actually been a blessing in disguise. Fastly has continued to add new customers (96 in the third quarter) and has seen the average spend for its enterprise clients climb every quarter. The fact is, more people are shopping online, and internet-based content consumption is on the rise. The COVID-19 pandemic took this existing trend and gave it a supercharged push. That's great news for Fastly's content delivery and security solutions.

Investors should also know that Fastly isn't just picking up small businesses as clients. It's already the preferred edge cloud platform for the likes of Pinterest, Twitter, Shopify, and the potentially soon-to-be-public Airbnb.

Investors should look for Fastly to double its sales every two to three years this decade.

Teladoc Health

In the healthcare space, I believe telemedicine kingpin Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) has what it takes to handily outperform crypto's most popular digital token. Teladoc also happens to be the stock I'm most excited about right now.

As you can imagine, it's received one heck of a boost from the pandemic. In an effort to keep coronavirus-infected patients out of doctor's offices and hospitals, as well as keep at-risk people in their homes, we've witnessed a huge uptick in virtual visits. In each of the past two quarters, Teladoc's virtual visit count has more than tripled from the prior-year period. But keep in mind that the company's compound annual growth rate prior to the pandemic (2013-2019) was a healthy 74%. COVID-19 has helped, but the company was growing like a weed well before it hit.

The telemedicine operating model also comes with a number of perks. It's more convenient for the patient (they don't have to travel) and physician (can fit in more visits). Additionally, health insurers typically pay less when patients conduct a virtual visit, relative to an in-office visit.

Another key puzzle piece to the Teladoc growth story is its recently completed acquisition of applied health-signals company Livongo Health. Livongo collects mountains of data on patients with chronic illness and, using artificial intelligence as an aid, sends its enrolled members tips and nudges to help them lead healthier lives. Livongo already has over 400,000 U.S. diabetics enrolled in its monthly subscription service.

The combined Teladoc and Livongo represent the future of personalized care in the United States. With the ability to cross-sell and gain new clients, Teladoc should consistently be one of the fastest-growing healthcare stocks.",2020-12-05 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/okexs-crypto-reserves-nosedived-after-withdrawals-opened/,"Trading Exchange Okex's Crypto Reserves Nosedived After Withdrawals Opened

Just recently, after the exchange paused cryptocurrency withdrawals, the trading platform Okex finally enabled digital currency withdrawals last Wednesday. Since then, the exchange seems to be experiencing an exodus of funds leaving, as onchain data shows Okex’s crypto-asset reserves like bitcoin, ethereum and tether have depleted considerably during the last ten days.

Over the years a number of exchanges have had issues and have worried customers by stopping deposits and withdrawals for a period of time. Okex joined the list of exchanges that have halted withdrawals, as the cryptocurrency trading platform with more than 490 crypto trading pairs paused withdrawals on October 16, 2020.

“One of our private key holders is currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations where required,” Okex said at the time.

While customers waited and complained on social media and crypto-related forums, regional reports claimed that Okex’s founder Mingxing “Star” Xu was taken away by the police.

Following more than a month of uncertainty, Okex announced the exchange would open up withdrawals again on November 26, 2020. The exchange also revealed a compensation and rewards program at the same time.

“For users who have made deposits, held tokens, or traded during the period in which withdrawals were closed,” the company stated. “Okex will put 20% of its total income from futures and perpetual swap transaction fees over the last seven weeks into an incentive fund that will be issued as a one-time payment to users based on their assets and transaction conditions.”

Onchain data stemming from the firm Cryptoquant indicates that customers are withdrawing funds in droves. For instance, back in August Okex was one of the largest exchanges, in terms of bitcoin (BTC) reserves, but has since seen a significant decline.

Cryptoquant data shows on November 25, the exchange’s 101,583 BTC reserves dropped to roughly 98k by December 4, 2020. Additionally, the netflow of stablecoins leaving the exchange in contrast to deposits has been massive.

For example, onchain data shows on November 25, Okex had around 275 million ERC20-based tether (USDT) and by December 4, the exchange only held 19 million tether. Percentage calculations show that the metric indicates over 96% of the USDT held by Okex has been withdrawn in as little as ten days’ time.

Although, according to a report written by the financial columnist Muyao Shen, a spokesperson for Okex believes there’s a discrepancy with Cryptoquant’s data.

“A spokesperson for Okex said Cryptoquant’s data did not match the firm’s internal records, but Okex has yet to provide their own figures,” Muyao Shen said on Thursday.

Statistics from the web portal Bituniverse, which displays an “Exchange Transparent Balance Rank,” shows Okex is currently the fifth-largest crypto exchange in terms of assets held in reserves.

The data sets Bituniverse displays are parsed from Peckshield, Etherscan, and Chain.info statistics. The Bituniverse stablecoin stats for Okex also show the data is almost the same as Cryptoquant’s aggregated count, as the app indicates Okex only has 20.2 million USDT under management on December 5, 2020.

The tax department collected information about bitcoin trades executed through banking channels before the Reserve Bank of India’s (the country’s central bank) crypto ban took effect in April 2018. The Supreme Court overturned the ban in early March, bringing cheer to both investors and local cryptocurrency exchanges.

Key Takeaways The leading U.S. tax regulator informed crypto traders about misreporting of taxes for year 2018.

For many, this has led to cumbersome tax audits or hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes.

The discrepancy is caused by 1099-K Form used by crypto exchanges.

Share this article

American crypto traders have recently reported receiving tax audit notices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The notices, called CP2000, are issued if the IRS systems detect misreported taxes for a particular year. In these notices, the regulator is referring to activity from 2018.

This is because the IRS audits filings on a two-year gap and is currently reviewing the 2018 tax year.



For many, these letters have caused a major headache. Beyond simple audit notifications, the IRS is demanding some traders pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes.

Tax experts in the industry have, however, identified the source of this issue: The 1099-K form.

Unpacking Tax Form 1099-K

In 2018, exchanges like Coinbase issued 1099-K forms for users who had more than $20,000 in traded volume and over 200 transactions.



The problem with the 1099-K form is that it does not show a trader’s gains or losses. Instead, the form adds up the proceeds from all the trades made on an exchange as income and reports that number to the IRS without factoring in the actual profits and losses.

This accounting error thus shows that traders have earned massive amounts of personal income.

As a result, the IRS automatically presumed that many traders underreported their income for 2018 and executed audits.

“We’ve seen a flurry of customers coming to TaxBit for help with CP2000 letters based on Form 1099-K’s issued by exchanges during the 2018 tax year. The Form 1099-K reports a user’s total aggregate volume of payment transactions and does not take into account cost basis, as such does not accurately represent what you might owe in taxes,” explained Justin Woodward, Crypto Tax Attorney at TaxBit.

All crypto transactions are reportable for tax purposes because the IRS considers cryptocurrencies as property. To file accurate capital gain returns, gains and losses on individual trades must be calculated.



Crypto taxation experts have explained the Form 1099-K was not designed for digital asset transactions and should not have been used by crypto exchanges in the first place.

“1099-K was never meant to be a form for cryptocurrency exchanges to use to report income. It was designed to report earnings from platforms where you are being paid directly by third party merchants like Uber, Lyft, and Etsy. The form does not make sense in the context of cryptocurrency exchanges,” CryptoTrader.Tax, a crypto tax software company wrote.

Experts say the ongoing issue can be resolved by explaining the situation to the IRS in a letter and proving traders’ actual gains and losses using data provided by exchanges for the year.

“Affected by the ongoing national crackdown on fraudulent SIM cards and bank accounts, the bank account of one of our core founders has received illicit money from international fraudsters and scammers,” the company said in a statement. “The founder has been taken away for 15 days for the investigation.”

The founder holds the private keys to most of the platform’s cold wallets. Since the exchange currently can not process all the withdrawals through its hot wallets, it said it has decided to suspend all withdrawals.

In the meantime, the platform will close all its over-the-counter (OTC) trading services because of the risks related to uncertainties surrounding China’s regulatory policies.

The State Council, China’s cabinet, announced a national crackdown on fraudulent bank accounts and SIM cards in October. “Fraudulent SIM cards and bank accounts are among the root causes that have enabled many phone and cyber scams,” according to the announcement.

People who want to avoid revealing their identity when opening a bank account or SIM card, many of whom are scammers, would buy existing SIM cards and bank accounts registered under others’ names.

Due to high demand for these fraudulent accounts, an industry has developed to create and sell these accounts, some of which are obtained via identity theft. Within two weeks of the State Council’s announcement, the Chinese police have arrested more than 4,600 people and confiscated about 65,000 bank cards that are linked to fraudulent banking accounts, according to a report by state media outlet CCTV.

(Bloomberg) -- India’s monetary policy makers are poised to hold interest rates this week as the economy faces a renewed threat to growth from the pandemic, with new cases hitting a record.All 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the six-member Monetary Policy Committee to keep the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 4% on April 7. Traders will watch for an explicit forward guidance from the Reserve Bank of India on how long the policy stance will stay accommodative and liquidity abundant despite stubborn inflation.Sticky underlying price pressures had earlier stoked expectations of policy normalization amid signs of a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. But those gains could come undone quickly if consumer demand is hit due to curbs on movement, such as those imposed in the capital New Delhi and by the state of Maharashtra, which houses the financial hub of Mumbai and contributes about 15% of the national output.“The current state of affairs will ensure that RBI will not pull back accommodative measures in a hurry,” said Teresa John, economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai, who expects a status quo.Here’s what to watch for in the MPC decision to be announced by Governor Shaktikanta Das in Mumbai on Wednesday morning:Growth ProspectsIn February, the central bank said it expects the economy to expand 10.5% in the year that began April 1 after an estimated 7.7% contraction in the previous 12 months. While Das has indicated there is no immediate threat to that forecast, he could still flag downside risks, given the current surge in virus cases that’s hurting mobility and consumption.Inflation ForecastWith Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government renewing the central bank’s mandate of keeping inflation between 2%-6% for another five years, policy makers are likely to reiterate that fighting price pressures will be a top priority. Fuel and food prices, which make up more than 50% of the consumer price index, represent the biggest problem for rate setters, given their ripple effect on inflationary expectations and underlying price pressures.India is among the few emerging markets in Asia where inflation is above the midpoint of its target band, due largely to food prices that are rising after a brief drop. Economists in a recent Bloomberg survey saw CPI at 5% in the April-June period before easing to 4.7% in the next three months. That compares with the central bank’s forecast of 5%-5.2% for the April to September period.“The risks of increasing input costs, higher commodity prices, seasonal upside in food prices and better pricing power could prod the MPC to relook at its inflation forecasts,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, local lockdowns, if they persist, could impact services demand negatively and put downward pressure on first-quarter core inflation and may act as a balancing factor.”Yield ControlBond investors will be watching on how active the RBI is with its version of yield curve control and how long the accommodative monetary stance lasts.“The market is expecting extended forward guidance in policy stance, from ‘going into next fiscal year’ to say ‘end of calendar year,’” said Naveen Singh, head of fixed income at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai.The bond market is facing another year of near record supply amid weak appetite for debt. Benchmark yields rose 30 basis points last quarter, the most since 2018 amid a sharp spike in U.S. yields and crude prices. Governor Das has assured investors that RBI will help ease the supply burden by purchasing at least 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion) of bonds through open market purchases, or OMOs, and more durable cash injection to compensate for the withdrawal of a relaxation in a cash reserve ratio.“We expect the RBI to reiterate that surplus liquidity will remain ample to support growth and that the space created by CRR reversal will be offset by OMO purchases of bonds to help bridge the gap between demand-supply of bonds and prevent longer-end bond yields from shooting up excessively in a short period of time,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG.(updates survey details in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,https://www.coindesk.com/niall-ferguson-bitcoin-china-winning-monetary-revolution,"The well-known economic historian connects the dots between bitcoin and CBDCs in the COVID-19 money era.

Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve heard two well-respected investment managers say they don’t believe in Bitcoin’s supply limit. If it’s easy to spin up another Bitcoin, they claim, then there is really no limit. Most of you reading this will be rolling your eyes at this stage, but since it seems to be a firmly held view by some smart people, we should dig deeper.

We’ll find that it’s about more than a lack of research.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

First, let’s look at what the two investment managers I’m referring to actually said.

This is from investment researcher and former hedge fund manager Jesse Felder’s blog post of a few weeks ago (my emphasis):

“Bitcoin believers rely entirely on the idea that bitcoin is limited in supply, making it far more attractive than fiat currencies that are being printed like mad by central bankers around the world. However, Bitcoin has already hard forked several times, multiplying the number and type of bitcoins in circulation. In fact, if you put together all the hard forks Bitcoin has undergone since it was first created, the number of total bitcoins has actually grown faster than the number of dollars. That’s a fact.”

And on the markets and investment podcast The End Game this week, investment manager and writer Fred Hickey said (again, my emphasis):

“The number five cryptocurrency is bitcoin cash! The number 12 biggest is bitcoin sv – there’s no limit to these things. If bitcoin got too expensive, they would just go to another one. These are speculators, they pile into anything that’s cryptocurrencies.”

For now, we’ll ignore the snide implications that bitcoin’s market is entirely speculator-driven, and that speculators don’t know how to do research (because those assertions are just too flimsy to even bother with). Instead, let’s focus on the misguided idea that new Bitcoin blockchains can be spun up whenever we want.

And let’s go deeper as to why this misunderstanding persists, and what that says about Bitcoin’s role in our evolution.

Not so fast

Most of you are familiar enough with crypto markets to know that Bitcoin is unique. But have you thought much about why?

It’s only partly the technology. The blockchain code is open source and can be copied and tweaked to make new bitcoin-like assets. But no matter what they call themselves, they are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size, allowing for larger throughput at the expense of a higher degree of centralization. Bitcoin SV increased block size again by multiples more.

The market tells us that investors prefer the original Bitcoin:

Source: CoinDesk

But have you ever heard an institutional investor talk at length about how Bitcoin’s SegWit scaling solution gives them more confidence as to the security of decentralization than Bitcoin SV’s whopping 128MB blocks? I’m sure that has happened; but I don’t think the scalability is a key investment criterion. It’s not the Bitcoin-specific characteristics that keep funds flowing into BTC.

It’s the network effects. I’m not referring to the Metcalfe’s Law effect of each additional node. Nor am I talking about the advantages of having more people to send bitcoin to (although that is not insignificant). I mean the market infrastructure and services that spring up around the asset with the highest volume: the on-ramps, sophisticated platforms, professional custody, complex derivatives and, even more important, the liquidity. Smaller assets, no matter how impressive their block size, are riskier. Investors care about that, and so, no matter how expensive BTC gets, I very much doubt they’ll just rotate into BCH or BSV.

Those market network effects, combined with the underlying technology’s characteristics and potential, are behind the current professional investor focus on BTC.

Trying to understand

Why is it hard for otherwise smart investors to see that? Here it gets interesting.

To see why, we need to look beyond the lack of research and the absence of interest. Underlying those is the assumption that traditional investment paradigms still hold.

Chief among these is the not-unreasonable conviction that technology is replicable, and that network effects early on are not necessarily permanent. MySpace lost out to Facebook, Google was not the first search engine. It’s hard for traditional investors to understand that Bitcoin is not a business, and better marketing from rivals is unlikely to make a material difference.

It’s also hard for traditional investors to think about technology in the same framework as natural elements. After all, elements just are. Their composition can never change. What’s more, their use can be discouraged, but they can never be eradicated.

Technology, on the other hand, is created by someone, according to chosen specifications, to fulfill a specific role. We can make it do one thing or another, and sometimes it gets used for something totally different than what we intended, but that’s the market for you. Technology is almost infinitely malleable in its composition and purpose. It’s also fickle, generally subject to the whims of the powerful, and driven by the conflicting urges of control and empowerment.

Until Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was created by someone but we don’t know who, so there is no one we can point to as responsible. Bitcoin is constantly being updated and tweaked by a small army of developers with diverse backgrounds and funding sources, but it cannot be fundamentally changed without network consensus, which would only be possible if its size shrunk to a small fraction of today’s. And its use can be discouraged, but Bitcoin cannot be turned off. All this gives Bitcoin – a technology – a curiously elemental status.

Here lies a not-too-ridiculous mental disconnect. Both of the above-mentioned investors have written extensively on gold, and instinctively understand the value of natural immutability and scarcity. Accepting that a technology can have similar properties is a stretch for most.

But understanding the difference between Bitcoin and other technologies, and the similarities between bitcoin and gold, is essential for grasping how significant its development is. It’s not just about the inflation hedge offered by bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization. It’s about civilization.

The emergence of metallurgy was, according to many theories, a trigger for the development of a complex society. It is entirely possible that the emergence of crypto technologies will be the catalyst for another societal restructuring. We’ve heard those outrageous claims before from technology advocates. But we haven’t before had a technology with element-like properties, that emerged in a technology-rich era ripe for catalysts, at a time buffeted by so many other society-transforming trends and events.

This confusion as to what Bitcoin is is shared by many, but by no means all. Renowned investor Paul Tudor Jones showed this week that he gets it when he said:

“If really I had to guess what the future [of crypto] was going to be, I’d guess it was going to be a lot like the metals complex – where you have “precious crypto” which might be bitcoin … And you’re going to have transactional cryptocurrencies, along with the sovereigns, and they may be more like the industrial metals.”

Throughout history, profound transformations are usually not noticed by the mainstream until well after the changes are under way. When traditional investors confound us with their ignorance and lack of research, we should try to understand why. And more importantly, we should appreciate what that says about the depth and subtlety of new definitions and new paradigms that will define value and society in the turmoil to come.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

U.S. stocks climbed to all-time highs and Treasury yields jumped while the dollar fell, after worsening COVID-19 statistics and still-high U.S. unemployment bolstered expectations for more federal stimulus.

This relentless rise irrespective of a bad economic outlook makes me nervous. It’s not just the disconnect of markets from main street reality; it’s also that market consensus is generally a sign that things are about to turn. However, with so much different about this year, who knows when investors will realize this, or even if they will care when they do.

Bitcoin also continued its rally, recovering from the slump seen a week ago to yet again post gains that made stocks look anemic. The feeling still seems to be that this rise is nothing like the hype-filled and speculation-driven rally of 2017. (Our Monthly Review for November looks at some of the differences.)

There will be ups and downs, for sure. But this time around, the market is very different: more mature, more liquid and more diverse. Much like its new participants.

Chain links

Maybe I should start a new section of this newsletter that just lists crypto-related statements and actions by institutional investors. This kind of news until very recently happened only once every few months. Now it’s almost daily.

Here are few of notable ones from this week:

· Paul Tudor Jones, speaking on Yahoo Finance, gave an enchanting analogy for how the crypto markets could evolve:

“If really I had to guess what the future was going to be, I’d guess it was going to be a lot like the metals complex – where you have “precious crypto” which might be bitcoin – it’s the first crypto, the first mover … and has that historical integrity amongst digital currencies. … And you’re going to have transactional cryptocurrencies, along with the sovereigns, and they may be more like the industrial metals.”

He also said he believes bitcoin has “the wrong price for the possibilities it has.”

· Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, acknowledged that bitcoin has “caught the attention” of many people, and that the nascent cryptocurrency asset class could “evolve” into a global market asset.

· The research arm of New York-based AllianceBernstein, a global investment manager with $631 billion in assets under management, produced a research note for clients that acknowledged that its initial rejection of bitcoin as an investment asset back in January 2018 was wrong.

· Guggenheim Partners, with over $230 billion in assets under management, has filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund to invest up to 10% of its net asset value in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC – Grayscale is owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk).

· A research note from Bloomberg Crypto posits that bitcoin could more than double its current value in 2021, reaching $50,000, based largely on demand-supply mechanics.

· Fidelity Digital Assets’ CEO Tom Jessop said this week that bitcoin is an “aspirational” store of value, but that its volatility prevents it from being one now.

· Steve Forbes agrees, saying that bitcoin could potentially become the “new gold,” but it’s not there yet.

· PayPal CEO and President Dan Schulman told the audience at tech conference Web Summit that, for cryptocurrency, “the time is now.” He also insisted that “you can do more with [bitcoin] than just ride the ups and downs.”

In other news:

Grayscale Investments (a subsidiary of DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) announced on Wednesday shares of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) will split 9-for-1, a move that will increase liquidity and perceived affordability of the shares. TAKEAWAY: While cryptocurrencies can be fractionalized (it still surprises me that some people think you have to buy a whole bitcoin), trust shares cannot. So, just like with equity shares, it can be convenient to lower the unit price, to make the shares more accessible to retail investors. ETHE is still only available to accredited investors on issuance, but holders can sell to the general public after the initial six-month lockup. This move should make that easier, and could boost the ETHE premium (the difference between the trust share price and the underlying value, currently at 124%, according to Ycharts) to even higher levels. This, in turn, will make it more appealing to accredited investors, boosting new inflows.

TAKEAWAY: Yes, this does imply that bitcoin’s allure is also perhaps a cultural construct, and perhaps also will not be permanent. That’s not a bad thing – that implies progress.

“Over the course of 2020 we are seeing a new group of investors who are Ethereum-first and in some cases Ethereum-only,” Sonnenshein said in an interview with Bloomberg. “There’s a growing conviction around Ethereum as an asset class.” Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.

“The development of the asset class has continued to solidify itself,” Sonnenshein said. “Ethereum has along the same lines of the staying power Bitcoin has.”

There have been a wide range of opinions on whether Ethereum’s native currency, ether (ETH), would become an even more contentious competitor to bitcoin as an asset class.

“For institutional investors, they are buying bitcoin for the digital gold narrative,” Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari, previously told CoinDesk. “Ether just isn’t in that conversation yet.”

Ether “benefits from spillover and likely has more conversation around it from crypto-natives,” Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said in an earlier interview with CoinDesk. “For the uninitiated, [it is] hard to see how bitcoin is not the sole on-ramp.”

The top U.S. banking regulator has confirmed that positive cryptocurrency regulation is coming in a matter of weeks, by the end of the Trump term. “It’s going to work for everybody,” said the regulator, adding that the new regulation will “make it easier for crypto investors to know how to invest,” therefore attracting more institutional investors.

New US Crypto Regulation Will ‘Work for Everybody’

Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, answered some questions about the upcoming U.S. cryptocurrency regulation in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday.

Brooks is the administrator of the federal banking system and chief officer of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC supervises nearly 1,200 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banks that conduct approximately 70% of all banking business in the U.S.

Regarding the new U.S. cryptocurrency regulation, Brooks said: “We’re very focused on getting this right. We are very focused on not killing this, and it is equally important that we develop the networks behind bitcoin and other cryptos as it is we prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.” He elaborated:

Believe me, there is a balance here and it’s going to work for everybody … there’s going to be very positive messages coming out.

Brooks’ answer was in response to a question about a rumor that the Treasury Department may be rushing out crypto regulation before the end of the Trump term. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong voiced his concerns on Twitter on Nov. 25. He wrote: “We heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin were planning to rush out some new regulation regarding self-hosted crypto wallets before the end of his term. I’m concerned that this would have unintended side effects.”

“What we do need is clarity about what is allowed, and so we need some guidance for example whether banks can connect directly to blockchains as payment networks, the answer has to be yes,” explained Brooks, who previously served as the chief legal officer at Coinbase. He emphasized that some aspects of the new regulation will provide clarity around the nature of crypto assets.

While noting that “it’s a dangerous world out there,” the top banking regulator stressed:

Nobody is going to ban bitcoin. Nobody is going to ban some of these transmission technologies so I think it’s going to be a lot less bad than than people worry about.

When asked about whether he believes more regulation will benefit the crypto industry, the OCC chief said: “I don’t think we need 50 regulations instead of two, but what we do need is clarity about what’s allowed.”

He continued: “We need some guidance, for example, about whether banks can connect directly to blockchains as payment networks. The answer has to be yes … We need the answers about can banks custody cryptocurrencies so that institutions feel comfortable adopting. And you saw what happened when we gave that clarity.”

When to Expect New US Crypto Regulation

Brooks was specifically asked whether people should expect new U.S. crypto regulation by the end of the Trump term. “I think you’re going to see a lot of good news for crypto by the end of the Trump term,” he replied, adding:

So you have clarity across a variety of areas that I think you’ll be seeing just in the next 6 – 8 weeks, which will make it easier for crypto investors to know how to invest, to know how institutions can be in this asset class.

“Those are the things that are driving prices at this point,” he opined. “You know it may have been a bubble two years ago, but with more clarity, institutions that see this as a real thing are going to adopt at scale, which they’ve already started to do. So stay tuned.”

A crypto intelligence firm has raised red flags about an increasing flow of comments in the crypto community about an ongoing phishing campaign, which is stealing funds from people who install a malicious browser extension.

Chrome Browser Extension Is Redirecting Crypto Users to a Fake Metamask Site

According to an alert published by Ciphertrace, since December 2, 2020, they have been noticing “an uptick of alerts and comments” about crypto funds stolen via a Chrome browser extension posing as the ethereum (ETH)-based wallet Metamask.

The fraudulent extension redirects victims to installmetamask.com, which is not an official site of Metamask. Per Whois information, the web domain was registered on November 29, 2020. Ciphertrace found out the first mention in Twitter of the fraudulent domain from a user who asked Metamask team about the site’s authenticity.

The screenshots taken to the fake MetaMask site mirrors the real one:

Fraudster Is Paying for Ads to Promote Phishing Site

Moreover, U.S.-based Ciphertrace posted an update on December 3, 2020, detailing that phisher behind Metamask’s fake extension keeps buying sponsored ads on Google, which appear when people search for “metamask” term.

This time, sponsored ads have been relying on other domain names by attempting to impersonate Metamask. One of the domains (meramarks.io), however, is offline as of press time.

The firm has been in contact with the crypto wallet company about the situation. Also, Metamask issued the following warning through their official Twitter account:

@Google is allowing a phisher to buy sponsored ads on their search results. When using crypto, try to use direct links, and if you need to use search, watch out for sponsored links.

Back on January 02, 2020, Google reversed its decision to ban the Metamask app from the Play Store, as per request from the crypto community.

In 2019, the company argued that its strict content policy on apps that expose users to “deceptive or harmful financial products and services” was a reason for the ban.

All The Actual Outdated Hollywood Figures In Netflix’s Mank

Warning: doable spoilers forward for Mank. Netflix‘s Mank is a Hollywood whodunit that has nothing to do with fixing a homicide, however every little thing to do with fixing the thriller of who truly wrote the script for the 1941 movie Citizen Kane. For many years, cinephiles have debated, due to a controversial essay by movie critic Pauline Kael, whether or not Herman J. Mankiewicz (a.ok.a. Mank) needs to be the only screenwriter credited on the legendary movie. Citizen Kane director Orson Welles additionally has a writing credit score on the movie, although, Kael argued he should not. That will help you come to a good conclusion, you will undoubtedly must know the true story behind each character in Mank. Most of whom are based mostly on actual individuals with actual connections to the person for which the film is called. (A touch, maybe, that the movie, directed by David Fincher, takes a facet.)Whereas lots of the gamers within the movie are notable Hollywood names — actress Marion Davies, newspaper writer William Randolph Hearst, director Orson Welles, simply to call a couple of — others are merely identified for being a part of Mank’s orbit. (Justice for poor Sarah!) Don’t be concerned, although, we’ll assist fill within the blanks by evaluating the true individuals to their film doppelgängers, performed by Sirius Black, Tywin Lannister, and one of many funniest ladies in Imply Ladies. And everyone knows that is actually saying one thing. The Actual Herman J. MankiewiczThe New York-born author bought his begin as a journalist earlier than transferring to Hollywood to turn out to be a screenwriter within the ’20s. The husband and father of two reportedly took the job to repay his playing money owed. Mankiewicz, whose nickname was “Mank,” was identified for his humour and imaginative and prescient. Whereas working as an uncredited author on The Wizard of Oz, the primary of 10 writers on that movie, he reportedly had the thought to shoot Kansas in black-and-white and Ozin coloration.He was the best paid screenwriter working in Hollywood earlier than his struggles with alcoholism and playing took a toll on his profession. (The New Yorker wrote that Mank “bought fired from each job he didn’t give up.”) He was unemployed when he met with the younger director Orson Welles, in 1939, to put in writing Citizen Kane.The Netflix movie is about in the course of the time Mankiewicz spent at a ranch in Victorville, California, engaged on a draft of Citizen Kane. Mankiewicz, in a half-body forged, was recovering from accidents he sustained in a automotive crash. Mankiewicz based mostly the movie’s foremost character on publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, who had as soon as been a good friend to him. He had frequented Hearst’s events till his ingesting bought him uninvited to Hearst’s fort San Simeon. Hearst was so upset by the movie’s portrayal, he used his papers to go after Mankiewicz. It bought so unhealthy, Mankiewicz went to the ACLU for assist. Mankiewicz’s contract denied him a credit score for the script, however he ultimately fought to have his identify on it. The battle brought about a rift between Welles and Mankiewicz, who would find yourself sharing the Academy Award for the movie’s screenplay. Neither man was in attendance, however the 1978 biography, Mank, claimed that Mankiewicz mentioned, had he gone to the ceremony, his speech would have been: “I am very happy to accept this award in Mr. Welles’s absence, because the script was written in Mr. Welles’s absence.” Mank ends with Mank (Gary Oldman), who died of kidney failure in 1953 on the age of 55, giving a speech of that very sentiment.Picture: By way of Wikimedia.Gary Oldman Performs MankWho is Mank?A Hollywood screenwriter who can not seem to get out of his personal means.

Welles reportedly teamed up with Mank to ghostwrite radio programmes, however ultimately recruited him as a co-writer of what would turn out to be Citizen Kane. However the 1971 New Yorker essay from Pauline Kael made the case that Welles didn’t write the “Citizen Kane” script. The declare upset Welles, who a 12 months later, informed Esquire there had been two first drafts of Citizen Kane.”We’d began to waste an excessive amount of time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on the story line and character, Mank went off with [his collaborator, John] Houseman and did his model, whereas I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine,” he mentioned. “On the finish, naturally, I used to be the one who was making the image, in spite of everything—who needed to make the choices. I used what I wished of Mank’s and, rightly or wrongly, stored what I appreciated of my very own.” In that very same piece, Welles’ secretary at the moment, Katherine Trosper, additionally vouched for her boss, saying that if he did not work on the script “then I’d wish to know what was all that stuff I used to be all the time typing for Mr. Welles!” Citizen Kane, a non-linear movie that tells the story of a media magnate’s life, was not an instantaneous hit, however within the a long time since, it is broadly thought of the very best American movie ever made.

It is perhaps how he earned the nickname “the most hated man in America.” Many cited his paper’s sensationalised tales about Cuba as the explanation America bought concerned within the Spanish-American Conflict. After constructing a monopoly of papers and radio stations, he additionally used his affect to smear these issues he did not like together with Citizen Kane.Orson Welles would declare his movie’s protagonist Charles Foster Kane, a self-absorbed and power-hungry newspaper man, was not based mostly on Hearst, however few, together with Hearst, believed him. The character had too many parallels to Hearst’s personal life: each owned elaborate mansions, each used their papers to start out a battle, each ran for political workplace and misplaced. The very fact Mank was a former eating companion of Hearst and his longtime lover Marion Davies. No shock, Hearst did not just like the unflattering portrayal of him and used his energy to show the movie right into a flop. None of his publications coated it, forbidding them to publish adverts, and he labored to maintain the movie out of cinemas, going as far to bribe the studio head behind Citizen Kane to burn the footage. He additionally reportedly pushed J. Edgar Hoover, then head of the F.B.I., to analyze Welles. Whereas the movie solely broke even on the field workplace, largely resulting from Hearst’s sabotage, the movie has gone on to be thought of a masterpiece of American filmmaking.

Many consider this was the start of the tip for Davies’ performing profession, who Hearst most well-liked to see in dramas, regardless of her comedic skills. Within the late 1930s, she would retire from performing all collectively.Whereas Citizen Kane was about Hearst’s life, Davies, because the movie exhibits, was not the model for Susan Alexander Kane, the talentless opera star who marries Charles Foster Kane. Thought that did not cease individuals from assuming she was. “It seemed to me to be something of a dirty trick and still strikes me as something of a dirty trick,” the movie’s director Orson Welles mentioned in 1982. “What we did to her.” (Some additionally consider that “Rosebud” was the pet identify Hearst gave her genitalia.)

In it, Alexander mentioned that she “took the dictation from Mankiewicz from the primary paragraph to the final… and later did the ultimate rewriting and the cuts, and dealt with the script on the studio till after the movie was shot.” She additionally claimed that Welles “didn’t write (or dictate) one line of the taking pictures script of Citizen Kane.”She admitted that she is the explanation Mankiewicz named Charles Foster Kane’s first spouse, Susan Alexander Kane.

The quicksilver nature of cryptocurrency markets makes it difficult to answer that question with clarity. Bitcoin's 2017 rally transmuted into a prolonged slump less than a year later. While analysts and commentators have stepped up with optimistic predictions, it is far from certain whether Bitcoin price will continue to increase.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin analysts and proponents have predicted price targets of $50,000 for the cryptocurrency next year.

Some commentators also say that the pandemic might have proved to be a turning point for Bitcoin's acceptance as a ""quasi-digital gold"" for investors.

A Trillion Dollar Target?

The risky underpinnings of cryptocurrency markets will appeal to traders and investors in 2021, according to analysts from Bloomberg. ""A risk-off decline like the 1Q could return Bitcoin towards the $10,000 support level in 2021, but we believe the path of least resistance remains higher,"" the analysts wrote. In simple words, investors will continue to embrace the risk and price volatility inherent in Bitcoin investing in 2021.

Bloomberg analysts have predicted a price target of $50,000 for Bitcoin, implying a $1 trillion market cap for the cryptocurrency. They cite increased demand for the cryptocurrency, mainstream adoption and interest, and diminished supply as Bitcoin reaches its 21 million supply target as reasons for their estimated price.

BTIG analyst Julian Emanuel has estimated a similar figure for the cryptocurrency's price next year. But his reasoning is different. Emanuel compared Bitcoin's price to the Nasdaq 100 (NDX), a market cap-weighted index consisting of 103 non-financial companies at Nasdaq. The index reached a peak valuation during the dotcom bubble and crashed soon after before beginning another gradual ascent.

""It took NDX 14 years to rise above its parabolic 'blowoff top,' then six years to rise a further 150%. Bitcoin appears poised to exceed the 2017 parabolic 'blowoff top' in a mere three years. Should Bitcoin's speed of ascent keep pace with the past three years and the degree of the rally approximate that of NDX, $50,000 per Bitcoin is a reasonable year-end 2021 price target,"" Emanuel wrote.

A New Future or a False Rally Redux?

Momentum can be a powerful price propellant. The actions of a single investor can induce others, who don't know much or any better, to follow them into a trade.

The price target predictions for Bitcoin bring back memories of 2017, when equally ambitious (and in some cases outlandish) predictions were made for Bitcoin's future. Back then, the cryptocurrency's astronomical prices fell as quickly as they had risen, leaving a trail of disappointed investors and shuttered investment firms.

But the conditions were different. Asian investors and retail traders were reported to have driven Bitcoin's previous price increase. They quickly moved in and out of trades, booked profits, and abandoned crypto markets not soon afterward. This move sucked out much-needed liquidity from crypto markets and crashed asset prices.

According to crypto-forensics firm Chainalysis, American investors driving the rally the rally this time around. Institutional firms and hedge funds, interested in parking their funds for the long term, are also beginning to pour funds into the asset class. In the long term, such liquidity should help propel future price increases because it strengthens the market and tamps down the intense volatility that has characterized crypto markets.

If history is any indication, the COVID-19 pandemic may have also proven to be a turning point for cryptocurrency markets. Prominent economic historian Niall Ferguson told online publication Barron's that pandemics are accelerators of financial history.

""We've seen that in just the same way that the use of coins as money was accelerated by the Black Death. Payments in kind were yielding to a cash economy in Europe, and this was accelerated in the 1340s,"" Ferguson said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the acceptance of Bitcoin as a ""quasi-digital gold"" among investors.

Caution Is Key

The glib utterances of analysts and Bitcoin proponents are not without their flaws, however. For example, Bloomberg analysts say that one of the reasons for Bitcoin's attraction lies in its lack of correlation to mainstream markets. But the recent whipsaw of crypto market movement has occurred in tandem with those of mainstream markets, which reached a record high the same time as Bitcoin surpassed its 2017 peak.

It is important to remember that trading volumes and liquidity for cryptocurrency markets are a fraction of those for mainstream markets. There are fewer players, less transparency, and minimal regulation. And so, all price targets and analysis fall within the realm of conjectures and can change with a single large trade.",2020-12-07 17:40:06.551000+00:00,https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-paris-money-laundering-bitcoin-russia-61b5109e954f494b80d51c452b3b18e2,"FILE - In this Oct.4, 2017 file photo, police officers escort Alexander Vinnik, center as they leave a courthouse at the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.

PARIS (AP) — A Russian bitcoin expert at the center of a multi-country legal tussle was sentenced in Paris on Monday to five years in prison for money laundering and ordered to pay 100,000 euros (more than $120,000) in fines in a case of suspected cryptocurrency fraud.

A court acquitted Alexander Vinnik of charges of extortion and association with a criminal enterprise, according to his lawyers. Vinnik denies wrongdoing, and his lawyers are discussing whether to appeal.

Vinnik, 41, is also wanted in the United States and Russia. He was accused of being behind a 135 million-euro ($160 million) fraud campaign that used ransomware and the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

French prosecutors say Vinnik was one of the creators of a malicious software called “Locky” that was delivered through email. If downloaded, the recipient’s data was encrypted and they were asked to pay ransom in bitcoin to free it.

A series of such attacks on French businesses and organizations between 2016 and 2018 led to 20 victims paying ransom demands issued in bitcoin, one of the more widely used cryptocurrencies, through BTC-e, one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges.

At his trial, Vinnik’s main line of defense was that he was only a technical operator carrying out the instructions of BTC-e directors.

The court convicted Vinnik of money laundering but didn’t find enough evidence to convict him of extortion, and stopped short of the 10-year jail term and 750,000 euros in fines that prosecutors had requested.

One of his French lawyers, Ariane Zimra, said his conviction for money laundering “doesn’t make sense,” arguing that cryptocurrency is not legally considered “money.”

Cross-border CBDC

Hong Kong’s central bank is reportedly working with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to test digital yuan use cases. PBOC’s Digital Currency Institute and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are discussing the technical pilot testing of using a digital currency for making cross-border payments. “As the renminbi is already in use in Hong Kong and the status of e-CNY is the same as cash in circulation,” an HKMA executive said. “It will certainly offer an additional payment option to those in Hong Kong and the mainland who need to make cross-border consumption.”

Mining revenue

Bitcoin miners generated an estimated $522 million in revenue in November, up 48% from October and the highest since late 2019, according to data from Coin Metrics. The sharp revenue increase came as bitcoin rallied 40% in November. Despite significant intra-year volatility, mining revenue measured by terahash per second (TH/s) is roughly flat year to date from roughly $0.138 per TH/s on Jan 1 to $0.135 per TH/s at last check. Additionally, network fees slightly decreased from October to November – from a $13 average transaction fee at the start of November to below $3 near month’s end.

Cardano fork

IOHK, the development team behind public blockchain project Cardano, said it is set to launch a hard fork in December as part of the transition to the third protocol development phase, focused on smart contract functionality. The hard fork will introduce the token-locking mechanism, thereby supporting certain smart contract use cases.

Bitcoin traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are taking on short positions as the leading cryptocurrency floats around $19,000. Net short open interest for CME leveraged funds, or the total amount of outstanding contracts, hit record highs of $1.3 billion at the end of last month. The market’s total open interest in bearish positions decreased slightly in early November, though is still up from September levels. Short positions are a bet that bitcoin’s price will drop.

At stake

Push & pull

In just under a year in office as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks has pushed forward several pieces of guidance favorable to the cryptocurrency industry. In letters and statements, Brooks, former counsel for Coinbase, gave permission for nationally chartered banks to custody crypto, hold dollar reserves for stablecoin issuers and generally created a positive sentiment around the industry. But none of this guidance is binding.

On Friday, U.S. Representative, and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters published her own letter, calling for President-elect Joe Biden to undo, or monitor, much of Brook’s work.

“As you begin to carry out the mandate given to you by the American people to restore trust in the federal government, I would like to highlight several areas where you and your team should immediately reverse the actions of your predecessors,” she wrote. This would include rescinding crypto and stablecoin services from the banking mandate.

This push and pull seen in government – between the executive and legislative branches, between Democrats and Republicans, and between public guidance and actual law – brings into relief the need for crypto-first industry standards. Whether favorable or skeptical, if a decision comes on from down high it will often lead to complications.

There are several self-regulatory focused groups in crypto, like the Gemini-led Virtual Commodities Association (VCA), as well as industry think tanks like Coin Center, that are doing meaningful work. The latest, a project between Bequant and Global Digital Finance, is looking to create “best practices” around decentralized finance (DeFi).

The companies announced last month they would form an industry group with law firm Hogan Lovells, aiming to bring industry participants together “with the goal of bringing credibility and integrity to DeFi projects around the globe,” according to a press release. Uniform standards can help the industry grow, without running into burdensome regulations.

The need for industry incubated standards is all the more relevant in light of Brooks’ proposals. Recently, the OCC chief proposed that banks be prevented from blacklisting certain politically charged, publicly vilified or legal but “at risk” businesses from banking services.

In a recent CoinDesk op-ed, J.P. Koning came out against the letter, saying that while it’s a noble attempt to stop “politically driven discrimination,” it would likely lead to a loss of diversity in services. “The underlying motivations are good ones,” Koning writes. Though it may not be for the best.

German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz issued a sharply worded statement after the meeting, underscoring his concerns about authorizing the launch of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency - newly renamed Diem - in Germany and Europe.

“A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf,” he said. “It is clear to me that Germany and Europe cannot and will not accept its entry into the market while the regulatory risks are not adequately addressed.”

He added: “We must do everything possible to make sure the currency monopoly remains in the hands of states.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hosted the 12th meeting of the G7 finance officials this year related to the COVID-19 pandemic as Washington prepares to hand over the presidency of the G7 to Britain next month.

The G7 finance officials discussed ongoing responses to “the evolving landscape of crypto assets and other digital assets and national authorities’ work to prevent their use for malign purposes and illicit activities,” Treasury said.

“There is strong support across the G7 on the need to regulate digital currencies,” the statement said.

The G7 officials reiterated their support for a G7 joint statement on digital payment in October, which said digital payments could improve access to financial services and cut inefficiencies and costs, but should be “appropriately supervised and regulated.”

Stablecoins are tied to a traditional currency or basket of assets, and used for payments or for storing value.

Facebook announced plans in June to launch its digital currency but regulators around the world fear it could destabilise the global financial system.

The cryptocurrency market seems ready for another bull run after a mundane weekend session. The market is dotted mostly in green, with the significant digital assets leading the price action. Bitcoin reclaimed the position above $19,000 but still is struggling to sustain gains toward $20,000.

As discussed earlier, Monero (XMR) is among the biggest single-digit gainers after breaking out of an ascending triangle. On the other hand, Stellar (XML) looks ready to dump to $0.08 following a sell signal on the weekly chart.

Bitcoin eyes a massive breakout beyond $20,000

Bitcoin is getting ready for a significant upswing to price levels above $20,000, but first, the ongoing consolidation has to run its course. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading slightly above $19,300 while the seller congestion at $19,500 limits its upside.

The Relative Strength Index has reinforced the sideways price action by levelling marginally above the midline. Bitcoin bulls can push the price above $19,500, which will help validate the anticipated upswing past $20,000.

A constriction of the Bollinger Bands hints at a possible breakout in the coming sessions or days. Therefore, to be on the safe side, buyers must not allow BTC to dive under the Bollinger Bands' middle boundary. If an extra bear push comes to shove, the 50 Simple Moving Average must be guarded at all costs, as buyers can build another uptrend from this level.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

On the flip side, massive losses will come into the picture if the price dives under the 50 SMA. This could also confirm a breakdown after the Bollinger Bands' squeeze. Tentative support areas include the 100 SMA at $18,600, the 200 SMA at $17,330 and late November's support at $16,500.

Ethereum holds firmly ahead of a potentially massive breakout

The smart contract has firmly held onto the ascending triangle support despite the multiple rejections from levels above $600. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $595, as bulls look forward to a massive breakout towards $700.

The 50 SMA protects the immediate downside, preventing bears from gaining momentum and causing damage to the progress made since the crash on November 26. A break above the triangle's x-axis will call for gains to $700, perhaps catapulting Ethereum into trajectory eyeing $1,000.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

Ethereum's uptrend will be sabotaged if bulls lose the ground above the 50 SMA. Besides, trading under the ascending trendline would be a bearish signal, calling the sellers to increase their entries.

The short-term price analysis is bearish, as seen with RSI's dip to the midline. The next support at $575, as highlighted by the 100 SMA, may be tested before completing the bearish leg to the 200 SMA.

Ripple price action remains numb ahead of a breakout

XRP is trading at $0.61 after holding above $0.60 during the weekend session. The mundane price action has brought indecisiveness in the market – the 50 SMA limits Ripple's upside. The cross-border token must close the day above this crucial level.

On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index and the Bollinger Bands endorse the consolidation. However, the more the bands squeeze, the faster a breakout will come into the picture. Several resistance zones might slow down the upswing, including $0.65, $0.7 and $0.75.

XRP/USD 4-hour chart

On the other hand, a breakdown will be confirmed if XRP closes the day beneath the 50 SMA. Selling volume is likely to increase from this level, pushing Ripple further down.

If declines overshoot the anchor at the 100 SMA, XRP/USD might be forced into a length downtrend.

The token is up another 5% on Monday. And the company hasn’t done anything yet.

The stunning numbers come with a range of investor caveats.

For now, you can only buy the WOZX token on Singapore-based crypto exchange HBTC (formerly called BHEX, launched in 2018 by the former CTO of Huobi). To buy WOZX on HBTC, you must buy the stablecoin Tether (USDT-USD), then use Tether to buy WOZX. (Or you could send Tether from a U.S. exchange to your HBTC wallet.)

WOZX will also get listed soon on Bithumb, a Korea-based crypto exchange. (Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies list on multiple exchanges, which is why different exchanges list a different all-time-high price for bitcoin, for example.) But you can’t buy and trade WOZX through a U.S. exchange site.

And Efforce, the company, is registered in Malta.

Bringing back the token sale boom?

Why would a legendary Silicon Valley engineer, who lives in California, register his new company in Malta? For the same reason so many other crypto projects (and daily fantasy sports operators) register there: The tiny island in the Mediterranean, with a population of 400,000 people, has extremely friendly financial regulations. (Bermuda has also been very welcoming to crypto projects.)

Story continues

Wozniak, speaking about his plans for Efforce at the Delta Summit in Malta in 2019, said Malta “has been on my mind for decades” and is “like no other place in the world.” He also said the Maltese government is “very favorable in moving forward in the modern world,” according to the Malta Independent. (Yahoo Finance has reached out to Wozniak for further comment on Efforce.)

American financial regulators, on the other hand, have not warmed to token sales or ICOs (initial coin offering), the crypto fundraising method that exploded in 2017 and then dried up in the U.S. when it became clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators considered almost all token sales to be unregistered securities offerings.

The core question of the ICO boom: Were investors buying these tokens because they wanted to be customers of the companies behind them, and participate in their blockchain ecosystem? Or were they buying them as a speculative investment on the promise the tokens would go up in value?

William Hinman, the SEC’s director of corporation finance, made the agency’s view clear at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit in 2018 when he suggested that bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are not securities, but most ICOs are securities offerings, and that, “calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or ‘ICO,’ or a sale of a ‘token,’ will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.”

That year, the SEC took a number of enforcement actions and levied fines against companies that listed tokens without SEC registration. Amid the ICO boom, virtually none of the ICOs that made instant millions registered with the SEC, and in many cases, regular investors lost their shirts.

Meanwhile, bitcoin hit a new all-time-high on Nov. 30, driven by institutional investors and public embrace of bitcoin by PayPal and Square. Bitcoin’s surge has helped boost prices of other altcoins.

This is the backdrop against which Wozniak has launched a digital token. It’s a risky investment, and one that, for now, you can’t make through a U.S. exchange site—but Wozniak’s imprimatur may make casual investors (and Woz admirers) feel safe.

Cryptocurrency trading on the app provided by Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, has hit record volumes. One billion euros in cryptocurrencies have been traded on the exchange’s crypto trading app, Bison, so far this year.

1 Billion Euros Crypto Trading Volume

Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, announced Monday that its cryptocurrency trading app Bison has reached a total trading volume of 1 billion euros (over $1.2 billion) so far this year.

The cryptocurrency trading volume on Bison also hit record highs several days in November, exceeding 35 million euros. The number of active users of the Bison app has also increased by 180% to 206,000 during the same time period.

“The increase in user numbers and the trading volume on Bison in the current year have far exceeded our expectations,” commented Ulli Spankowski, CEO of Sowa Labs GmbH, the subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures GmbH which developed the Bison app. He added:

The positive development shows that with simple and reliable trading we are making the right offer in an exciting market environment for cryptocurrencies.

Using Boerse Stuttgart’s Bison app, users “can trade bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and ripple (XRP) free of charge and at the prices displayed in the app,” the announcement details.

Boerse Stuttgart also operates a regulated cryptocurrency exchange called BSDEX (Börse Stuttgart Digital Exchange). The company explained that “BSDEX meets the regulatory requirements in accordance with section 2, paragraph 12 of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz).” Customers can use the exchange to buy and sell bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and XRP.

One source with knowledge of the plans told CoinDesk that BBVA is “launching its Europe-wide crypto initiative from Switzerland.”

“There are still some compliance hurdles so this will not be in December, but I expect they [BBVA] will be live next month,” they added.

Asked if BBVA was building its solution primarily to deal with tokenized securities and the like, the source said: “This is a cryptocurrency offering.”

BBVA said it could not comment.

BBVA is rumored to have integrated the same custody solution for digital assets, called SILO, as Russia’s Gazprombank. (Gazprombank is already live with a crypto offering in Switzerland.)

About six months ago, BBVA began work on integrating the SILO custody platform built by core banking software provider Avaloq and Swiss crypto specialists METACO, according to the source. METACO is also known to be working on an institutional custody solution with London-headquartered Standard Chartered.

Avaloq and METACO declined to comment.

A second source said the project will likely surface “around Christmas,” adding that there are still regulatory issues to iron out.

“The project has to pass through several processes to get a green light and become a reality,” they said.

The report outlined the impact of Gold outflows on crypto funds. Gold investment products saw a record $9.2 billion outflows over the last 4 weeks as gold investors apparently diversified their portfolio through investment in crypto-focused funds.

“More and more institutional investors look at Bitcoin as a digital store of value and a new hedge against inflation.

Overall, the cryptocurrency funds attracted nearly $430 million in the latest week, which makes it the second-highest weekly inflow on record, just behind the record of $468 million three weeks ago. Grayscale topped the list with nearly $336 million crypto inflows last week to push its total assets under management to more than $12.4 billion.

Bitcoin remained the most preferred cryptocurrency for institutional investors as BTC-focused funds gained more than $334 million inflows in the latest week.

Russian crypto exchange BTC-e’s operator Alexander Vinnik has now been sentenced to five years in prison by a French court and fined 100,000 euros. He was arrested over three years ago in Greece, extradited to France, and is wanted in the U.S. and Russia.

Vinnik Sentenced After 3+ Years

Alexander Vinnik, the operator of the now-defunct Russian cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, was sentenced on Monday to five years in prison by a French court for money laundering. The 41-year-old is also ordered to pay fines of 100,000 euros ($121,270).

While convicted of money laundering, Vinnik was acquitted of extortion, association with a criminal enterprise, and cyberattacks linked to the Locky ransomware since the court did not find enough evidence to convict him. The prosecutors alleged that he created the ransomware that about 200 companies and individuals in France fell victim to from 2016 to 2018 with an estimated total damage of 135 million euros.

His lawyers are discussing whether to appeal. Ariane Zimra, one of his French lawyers, argued that since cryptocurrency is not legally recognized as “money,” her client’s conviction for money laundering “doesn’t make sense,” the Associated Press quoted her as saying.

Arrested in July 2017 while on vacation in Greece, Vinnik was taken into custody by Greek police under an international warrant issued by the U.S. He was extradited to France in January this year. While some believe that he was the mastermind behind the BTC-e crypto exchange, Vinnik argued that he was only a technical operator who carried out instructions given to him by BTC-e’s directors.

Vinnik is also wanted in the U.S. and Russia. While Russian authorities are investigating his involvement in an $11,000 fraud case, U.S. authorities allege that his BTC-e crypto exchange helped criminals launder more than $4 billion.

* New Mexican law requires platforms to report large trades

* Has led to over 1,000 alerts this year, agency tells Reuters

* Arrests of suspects Santoyo, Ortiz early successes for reform

* LatAm, US officials still have limited visibility of dark web

MEXICO CITY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - In April 2019, Mexican police arrested suspected human trafficker Ignacio Santoyo in a plush area of the Caribbean resort of Playa del Carmen after linking him to a prostitution racket extending across Latin America.

Yet it was not the 2,000 women Santoyo is alleged to have blackmailed and sexually exploited that ultimately led to his capture, but the bitcoin he is suspected of using to help launder the proceeds of his operations, officials said.

The cryptocurrency is emerging as a new front in Latin America’s struggle against gangs battling for control of vast criminal markets for sex, drugs, guns and people, according to law-enforcement authorities.

“There’s a transition to committing crimes in cyberspace, like acquiring cryptocurrencies to launder money ... and the pandemic is accelerating it,” said Santiago Nieto, head of the Mexican finance ministry’s financial intelligence unit (UIF).

Neither Santoyo, who is in custody, nor lawyers representing him could be reached for comment, and they have not commented publicly on the case in the past. The Mexican attorney general’s office declined to comment while the case remained open.

Santoyo’s arrest represented an early success for a new law in Mexico - one of only two nations in Latin America, with Brazil, to enact such legislation - that seeks to tackle the intractable problem of how law agencies can track the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies designed to anonymize users.

The law requires all registered cryptocurrency trading platforms to report transfers above 56,000 pesos ($2,830). It was passed in 2018 but it took many months to implement the system, which is still a work in progress.

Bitcoin’s use to launder money is particularly increasing among drug gangs such as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel of captured kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, U.S. and Mexican authorities say.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has faced record levels of gang-fueled violence during his first two years in office, and the prospect of cartels hiding their profits in lightly-regulated spaces is a major concern.

The sums involved in the few cases uncovered are typically thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. They represent a drop in the ocean compared with organized crime’s hard cash laundry - estimated at $25 billion a year in Mexico alone, according to the government and financial-intelligence firms.

Yet larger sums have begun to crop up across the region over the last three years, with a team of international police breaking up three Colombian drug gangs laundering millions of dollars via cryptocurrencies, authorities say. In Mexico, the hope is that the new rules will help snare big fish.

‘BANDIDOS REVOLUTION’

The only thing tougher than smuggling drugs across borders is getting the profits back to cartels, officials say. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to high risk. Putting it into banking systems geared to detect dirty money is perilous, too.

UIF chief Nieto said criminals typically split their illicit cash into small amounts and deposited them in various bank accounts, a technique known as “smurfing”. The threshold for banking transactions that raise red flags is $7,500.

They then use those accounts to buy a series of small amounts of bitcoin online, he added, obscuring the origin of the money and allowing them to pay associates elsewhere in the world.

In Santoyo’s case, authorities who had been pursuing him for months said they finally tracked him down after he bought enough bitcoin to trigger an alert under the new law. Moreover, when making his transactions via a registered platform, Santoyo left personal details including his phone number and address.

Between May and November 2018, Santoyo and his sister acquired some 441,000 pesos ($22,260) in bitcoin between them on Bitso, a trading platform in Mexico and Argentina, according to government records seen by Reuters.

Bitso, one of 11 registered crypto trading platforms in Mexico, declined to comment.

Mexican authorities also have their sights set on “Bandidos revolution team”, a gang federal prosecutors suspect of stealing millions of dollars through cyber attacks on large banks.

In May 2019, authorities detained suspected gang leader Hector Ortiz in the central state of Guanajuato after he spent “tens of thousands of dollars” on bitcoin.

That triggered the bitcoin threshold sensor, enabling investigators to trace Ortiz via his phone.

Neither Ortiz nor lawyers representing him could be reached for comment. The Mexican attorney general’s office declined to comment because the case remains open.

DELVING INTO DARK WEB

Rolando Rosas, head of the Cyber Investigations Unit (UICOT) at the Mexican attorney general’s office, said it was tough to track criminals’ use of bitcoin, even with the new law.

UICOT has about 120 people on its staff. But to be competitive, it needs about four times that, he added.

The work is painstaking, and often frustrating.

The new law has led to 1,033 bitcoin threshold alerts being triggered so far this year. Investigators must chase up each one to check if it could be suspicious and whether the user is linked to any criminal behavior or cartels.

Even then, such a system can only identify transactions with registered trading companies. Rosas acknowledged his team had limited visibility of dealings in the dark web and unregulated platforms, which U.S. and Latin American officials say mask the true scale of laundering.

About 98% of all Mexico’s transactions above the 56,000-peso threshold in 2020 were flagged by one registered crypto platform, in the CJNG cartel’s home state of Jalisco, according to government data seen by Reuters.

That, said UIF chief Nieto, suggested the CJNG could be active in money laundering via cryptocurrencies. But it is too early to estimate how much money is involved in Mexico’s crypto laundry because data is still scarce, he added.

In another sign of the lengths to which organized crime is going to avoid moving hard cash, U.S. officials have told Reuters that cartels are also turning to Chinese “money brokers” who use burner phones and Chinese banking apps to move funds.

A drop in seizures of hard currency over the past decade - from $741 million to $234 million in 2018 - suggests newer technologies including cryptocurrency laundering are gaining ground, according to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) report published in January this year. Most of the money came from Colombian and Mexican cartels, it said.

The DEA told Reuters the use of digital currencies by such cartels - or Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs)- was an “emerging and increasing trend to launder illicit proceeds”.

“Both Mexican and Colombian TCOs are increasing their use of virtual currency because of the anonymity and speed of transactions,” said spokesman Michael Miller. “It is believed the use of virtual currency will only increase in the future.”",2020-12-08 12:01:23+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/facebook-hopes-the-cryptocurrency-diem-it-backs-will-launch-in-2021.html,"In this article FB

The cryptocurrency was renamed Diem in December 2020. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images

Facebook should be given the ""benefit of the doubt"" by regulators in its ambitions to launch the cryptocurrency it backs and its digital wallet, the head of the company's financial services arm said on Monday. David Marcus, the head of Facebook Financial, also known as F2, said he hopes both the cryptocurrency called Diem and the social networking firm's wallet Novi will launch next year. ""I hope that we get to participate with … Novi and Diem and the big changes of 2021, pending regulatory approvals where we need to obtain them,"" Marcus said at the Singapore FinTech Festival, addressing a question on the biggest changes for financial services in the year ahead.

Facebook's cryptocurrency project has been a rollercoaster since it was announced last year, facing huge criticism from regulators, a scaling down of ambitions and a rebrand. The cryptocurrency was initially called Libra and was designed to be managed by a non-profit consortium consisting of several companies called the Libra Association. Facebook had planned to launch a wallet called Calibra that would allow users to send this cryptocurrency to each other. One Libra coin was initially supposed to be backed by a basket of currencies. But regulators raised a number of concerns from the impact Libra could have on financial stability to issues over data privacy and money laundering. In April, the Libra Association scaled back plans and said it would offer stable coins backed by just one nation's currency, rather than a single coin backed by several currencies. And last week, the Libra Association changed its name to the Diem Association. Earlier this year, Facebook changed the name of its digital wallet Calibra to Novi. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the cryptocurrency Diem is preparing to launch as early as January, citing three people familiar with the matter. The Diem Association is currently waiting for approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority as the organization is based in Switzerland, the FT reported. Marcus was not asked about this report specifically during the course of the panel. Though Diem is described as a cryptocurrency, it is not like bitcoin which is perhaps the most well-known digital coin. It has a central organization behind it, something that bitcoin doesn't. It is also backed by fiat currency, again a point of difference with bitcoin.

'Benefit of the doubt'",2020-12-08 00:00:00,https://www.cityam.com/bitcoin-sets-a-new-all-time-high-and-ethereum-starts-its-journey-to-eth-2-0/,"Last week was one of the most exciting weeks in 2020 for the crypto community, with an abundance of bullish news for Bitcoin and the achievement of a huge milestone for the Ethereum Foundation. Bitcoin’s new all-time high is $19,911, and this price was reached at 11:00 UTC on December 1, according to data by CryptoCompare.

An hour later, Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain successfully launched. The Beacon Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, and it signals the first step in the plan to change Ethereum’s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake. It runs alongside the original Ethereum PoW chain, making sure that there is no break in the continuity of the chains.

Phase 1, which is expected to launch in 2021, will “address finality and consensus on shard chains”, and it will be “more of a ‘test run’ for shard chains than the release of an immediately-scalable solution.” It is hoped that ETH 2.0 will increase throughput by over 1000x, which will alleviate the high fees associated with Ethereum transactions currently.

Forbes reported last week that the partnership between Visa and Circle Internet Financial (“Circle”), which developed dollar-backed stablecoin USDC Coin (USDC), means that Circle will help Visa card issuers to enable sending/receiving USDC payments.

The report said that “businesses will eventually be able to send international USDC payments to any business supported by Visa, and after those funds are converted to the national currency, spend them anywhere that accepts Visa.”

Once Circle has gone through Visa’s Fast Track program (sometime next year), Visa will create a card that allows any businesses to send/receive USDC to/from other businesses via the card. After the USDC funds are converted to the local currency, businesses can spend the money anywhere that takes Visa.

Michael J. Saylor, Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq-listed business intelligence company MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), disclosed that his firm had bought more bitcoins. Back on September 14, Saylor tweeted that MicroStrategy had to date “purchased a total of 38,250 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $425 million, inclusive of fees and expenses.”

Now, Saylor says that MicroStrategy has spent another $50 million of its cash on Bitcoin, buying “approximately 2,574 bitcoins for $50 million in cash in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $19,427 per bitcoin.” MicroStrategy now holds roughly 40,824 bitcoins and its share price has risen 170% this year due to the bitcoin allocations.

CryptoCompare, a leading cryptoasset market data provider, launched the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIX), which was developed in partnership with the University of Sussex Business School.

This innovative tool for Bitcoin traders provides a highly accurate way to understand Bitcoin’s 30-day implied volatility, i.e. how volatile Bitcoin prices are likely to be over the next 30 days based on traders’ expectations. It is expected that the index will be used to create new financial products that allow funds to better manage risk.

Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, and his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss explained why they expect the price of Bitcoin to reach $500,000 or more within the next decade. He explained:

“Our thesis is that Bitcoin is gold 2.0 and it will disrupt gold. If it does that, it has to have a market cap of $9 trillion. So we think Bitcoin could price one day at $500,000 a bitcoin.”

Larry Fink, Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said during an interview that “Bitcoin has caught the attention and the imagination of many people.”

Fink’s comments about Bitcoin came during a talk with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at the Council on Foreign Relations. Fink also mentioned that a successful digital currency could affect the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s main reserve currency:

“Having a digital currency has a real impact on the US dollar because having a digital currency makes the need for the US dollar less relevant for international holders of dollar-based assets.”

During an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Brian P. Brooks, Acting Comptroller (since May) at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said that “nobody is going to ban Bitcoin.”

Brooks is currently also a member of the Board of Directors of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Between September 2018 and March 2020, he served as Chief Legal Officer at crypto exchange Coinbase.

Standard Chartered’s crypto trading group comprises five of the biggest over-the-counter (OTC) traders and four exchanges, and will include an Ethereum-based settlement token, a well-placed source told CoinDesk.

The firms involved in the custody and trading project include LMAX and ErisX, according to the source. Also supporting the project are Switzerland-based custody provider METACO, in which Standard Chartered has invested; and U.K.-based trading technology provider Cobalt (where Standard Chartered is also an investor).

Standard Chartered and the other firms named in the group all declined to comment.

“Standard Chartered plus five of the biggest traders in digital assets and four exchanges are about to get this new model started,” said the source. “I think the first test trade will be next month and I’d say it’ll end up involving the 10 biggest exchanges in digital.”

Tether, but for banks?

A settlement token used in Standard Chartered’s crypto trading platform will be based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, the source added.

“A lot of people were pushing to use Hyperledger, Corda, but we have specifically gone for something the native crypto community are comfortable with,” the source said.

The system will create an institution-focused equivalent of Silvergate Bank’s exchange network (SEN), the source added.

“We are building our own token of fiat collateral and hoping that will become the equivalent of Tether, except that the tokenized collateral or money will be held in the trading bank account of a proper bank, like a Standard Chartered, a JPMorgan, a Deutsche Bank,” the source said.

(The token sounds somewhat akin to the Avit, a bank-issued digital asset from Caitlin Long’s Avanti Financial.)

Standard Chartered’s innovation arm, SC Ventures, was reported to be working on an institutional crypto custody project back in the summer. The bank is involved in multiple projects touching on crypto including an anti-money laundering (AML) solution. Speaking at a virtual event Monday, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters teased that an announcement was in the works.

“Standard Chartered has been working on this for a long time and is jointly working with other giants in the crypto space,” a second source involved in the build told CoinDesk. “This is extremely serious and not some proof of concept. They have passed all the checks and compliance and are bringing in some exciting names.”

Big banks who once shunned crypto are fast warming to the idea, with Spain’s second-largest lender, BBVA, said to be launching a digital asset custody and trading offering out of Switzerland early next year.

“We have seen a decisive shift from enquiries of a speculative nature to those that begin with comments such as, ‘bitcoin is here to stay, please help us understand it’,” James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, told Reuters.

Butterfill also noted that the level of interest is so high, bitcoin is likely only on “the cusp” of institutional adoption.

Bitcoin and associated investment products were the most popular out of the cryptocurrency options among bigger investors last week. The top cryptocurrency by market value took the lion’s share of the total AUM at around 334.7 million out of the $429 million across all crypto assets.",2020-12-08 09:23:02+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-cofounder-steve-wozniak-on-wozx-crypto-listing-i-think-of-our-tokens-as-shares-of-stock-193142748.html,"Efforce, a new Malta-based blockchain project for funding energy-efficient businesses, launched last week with the listing of its cryptocurrency token WOZX, named for Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The token had such high investor interest, the company touted in a press release on Friday, that it soared to a $950 million market cap “in the first 13 minutes” of its listing.

Wozniak is one of six co-founders of Efforce, not its CEO, but the token bears his name, and the company’s own press release calls Efforce “his second company.”

The token is up 14% on Tuesday. For now, it’s only listed on Singapore-based crypto exchange HBTC, though WOZX will also soon get added to Korea-based crypto exchange Bithumb.

There are regulatory risks to a token sale or “initial coin offering” (ICO) in the U.S. The fundraising method exploded in popularity in 2017, but the boom came with many scams, and by 2018 the SEC began cracking down on companies that conducted token sales since the agency deemed almost all of them to be unregistered securities offerings. More recent token sales have instead listed outside the U.S. to avoid regulatory headaches.

But any cryptocurrency associated with Apple legend Wozniak is bound to attract mainstream interest. Wozniak agreed to answer Yahoo Finance’s questions about the project over email.

What follows is an edited transcript.

Yahoo Finance: So, this is really you involved with Efforce—they’re not falsely using your name.

Wozniak: “It is I.”

Does the WOZX token have your sign-off, and what’s your official role at the company?

Wozniak: “I’ve been working in stealth with this group for a couple of years. I am in an engineering role, contributing to the blockchain thinking and accessibility of WOZX. I am proud that we are going with the WOZX name. To me, it’s a recognition and an honor. I think of it like WOZ U [his tech education business]. I have always favored bringing the less advantaged into positions of investment for worthy corporations (in this case, environmental) as well as promoting efficiencies and trust.”

Story continues

How much has the WOZX token sale raised, in total, and how much do you own?

Wozniak: “I don’t personally know how much I have for Efforce. I’m not operationally involved, and avoid financial considerations. I do so in my own life. There was never a time that I could tell you how much I have myself or where it is. I never deal with even my own banking. I do not invest directly and have no stocks at all, other than startups of friends, and I don’t even know what or how much of that. I have never used a stock app on my iPhone or any stock investing websites... I never started Apple to make any money either.”

Why is Efforce registered in Malta?

Wozniak: “Malta has an exchange and positive government support for it, to handle blockchain tokens with the appropriate regulation. This has been worked out over a long period with precautions. I think of our tokens as shares of stock. I have travelled to Malta as part of this (prior to COVID) and spoken with involved parties and given my blessing to it. I’d love to be a Malta citizen someday but COVID is really in the way of that these days.”

The WOZX token sale was an ICO—Do the SEC enforcement actions in the U.S. against ICOs in the recent past concern you?

Wozniak: “I’m not the financial structure guy. You treat me as a CEO but you are incorrect in that... I have been to Italy multiple times over years to meet with the principals in Efforce. I took my time and wound up warmly endorsing them and being totally impressed at their acumen and business operations... This is not a fly-by-wire event.”

The digital currency exchange confirmed that Bitcoin continues to gain institutional support.

BTC’s recent price action has been “relatively muted” when compared to the previous week, the report noted. It confirmed that last week Bitcoin recorded a new all-time high. The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading for around $18,300 at the time of writing (having dropped below the $19,000 mark). For the past couple weeks, Bitcoin has mostly been trading in the $18,000 and $19,500 range.

As mentioned in OKCoin’s crypto market report:

“This consolidation [of the Bitcoin price] has allowed certain altcoins (alternative coins besides BTC) to rally. For instance, Compound’s COMP has risen considerably in the past week. But large-cap assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) have been relatively neutral to negative. Analysts are confident that the overall Bitcoin trajectory is one of growth. Case in point: institutional investors this past week continued to pledge their support for the leading cryptocurrency — and seems like Ray Dalio is on board as well.”

In a separate report, crypto research firm Messari points out that what’s different today from a few years ago is Bitcoin’s (BTC) “prominence in the macro conversation, and its emergence as a smart money alternative to gold.”

The extensive report from Messari notes:

Paul Tudor Jones has referred to Bitcoin as “the fastest horse”;

Stanley Druckenmiller has stated that “the bitcoin bet will probably work better” than gold;

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya recommends that “everyone should have 1% of their assets in bitcoin”;

Wall Street legend Bill Miller “strongly recommended” that investors gain exposure to BTC if they didn’t yet own the digital asset;

JPMorgan stated that family offices “may be looking at Bitcoin as an alternative to gold”;

Raoul Pal said that “Bitcoin is a supermassive black hole”;

Messari’s report also mentioned:

“Ethereum may have even taken a permanent lead this year versus Bitcoin in terms of economic value transferred on its rails. It’s hard to ignore five-year-old technologies that process more than $1 trillion in real value transfers per year, a figure that has already eclipsed PayPal’s. Ethereum has challenges ahead, but its dynamism is undeniable, and it will continue to be the platform to watch in 2021.”

As confirmed in another report from Coin Metrics, Ethereum (ETH) hash rate has reached a new-all-time high (on December 1, 2020). The ETH hash rate began its sharp rise this past summer, “spurred on by the rise of (decentralized finance) DeFi and subsequent rise in ETH transaction fees,” the report stated. It added that the DeFi mania appears to have “cooled off towards the end of September 2020, [and] there were some questions whether ETH’s hash rate would be able to continue its growth.”

Coin Metrics further noted:

“The launch of the beginning phases of Ethereum 2.0 and the eventual switch to Proof of Stake raises more questions about how Ethereum’s Proof of Work system will perform in the interim. Interestingly, ETH’s hash rate hit a new all-time high the day the ETH 2.0 beacon chain (the first step towards Proof of Stake) went live, and has remained near all-time highs in the days since.”

A recent digital asset fund flows report from CoinShares states that crypto-assets “shook off the wobble in prices two weeks ago with the second-largest investment product inflows on record totaling US$429m bringing total assets under management to a record US$15bn.”

For the few years immediately following its inception in 2009, Bitcoin traded at pennies on the dollar. But last Monday, more than a decade into the cryptocurrency’s existence, Bitcoin investors hit the jackpot. According to data provider CoinDesk, the price of a single Bitcoin hit $19,850 for the first time ever, breaking its previous record of $19,783 in December 2017.

Market analysts are quick to remind investors that Bitcoin remains a risky asset. After all, the cryptocurrency king’s record-setting week was the culmination of a sharp seven-month long increase since its March low, when it plunged below $6,000 following the stock market’s pandemic-induced crash. But as demand continues to increase and blockchain technology edges toward the mainstream, investors are becoming more and more optimistic that Bitcoin’s volatility is only temporary, and that the cryptocurrency will reap big returns in the long run.

What accounts for last week’s rally? Some say the surge was simply a product of November’s gangbuster month for the stock market, driven by good news on the vaccine front and investors’ ongoing anticipation of a swift economic recovery. Over the past few months, the Federal Reserve’s low interest rates have deterred people from putting their assets into safer bets like government bonds. Investors have instead flocked to more speculative alternatives like Bitcoin, hoping to reap big gains while the market is hot.

Market analysts attribute Bitcoin’s 2017 peak to a surge in individual traders who caught the cryptocurrency fever and capitalized on Bitcoin to “get rich quick.” Highly accessible platforms like Robinhood, PayPal and Square’s Cash App have recently fed into this day trading frenzy by facilitating Bitcoin trades and allowing inexperienced investors to dip their toes in the crypto market.

Luke Lloyd, a wealth adviser and investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, says that institutional participation has also been a game changer for the cryptocurrency market this year, as more and more professional investors have begun betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value. Square, a financial service owned by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin in October. “Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company’s purpose,” the company wrote in a statement.

Even though Bitcoin remains a speculative investment, Lloyd said that last week’s rally “doesn’t feel as euphoric as it did three years ago,” given that more and more investors appear to be holding onto cryptocurrency for the long term. Many retail investors now operate under the assumption that even fractional shares of Bitcoin could become a goldmine in just a few years’ time.

Bitcoin is still a relatively young product. It was launched in January 2009 by pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who developed the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation. Its decentralized structure immediately attracted libertarian types in search of cash alternative assets and eager to build their investment portfolios without government oversight.

Unlike paper currencies, Bitcoin is powered by blockchain technology, a decentralized digital database that tracks the whereabouts of every single coin in circulation. New transactions create new blocks of data that are linked together in a chain-like sequence. The interconnectedness of each block in the financial ledger means that all transactions are added in chronological order and are therefore irreversible.

There is no central authority that regulates Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of computers around the world called “nodes” verify transactions in a collective network, preventing any singular actor from falsifying data or counterfeiting coins. The process is transparent, efficient, and doesn’t require a middleman for account transfers.

Bitcoin’s value is also contingent on its finite supply. Unlike central banks, which can print new money at will, Bitcoin’s entire operating philosophy revolves around scarcity: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. This means that much like gold, precious metals, and other scarce commodities, Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation.

Roughly 18.6 million bitcoins are currently in circulation. Once 21 million bitcoins have been mined, the cryptocurrency will meet its supply cap and its price will likely surge. “The more people that buy and hold Bitcoin, the lower the supply that is out there that is tradeable which inherently increases the price,” Lloyd explained.

At a roughly $362 billion valuation, Bitcoin accounts for over two-thirds of the total market value of all cryptocurrencies. According to James Barth, a professor of finance at Auburn University’s Harbert College of Business, there are roughly 5,000 other cryptocurrencies in existence. The most popular alt-coins—Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple—typically track Bitcoin’s market patterns, shooting up when Bitcoin surges and vice versa. But Bitcoin is still the biggest fish in the pond, and its name recognition means it will almost certainly continue to drown out competitors going forward.

“I don’t think any of the alt-coins are going to gain as much traction ever as Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean there’s not money to be made in them,” Lloyd said. Market analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin and downstream competitors will keep up the momentum next year. “I am looking for $50,000 by the end of 2021 and I think $100,000 is in the question for a year end 2021 target,” Lloyd said.

That said, the federal government is keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency market. In October, the Justice Department published a report highlighting blockchain technology’s role in propping up illicit drug markets and dark web money laundering schemes. The attorney general’s Cyber Digital Task Force concluded that “despite its relatively brief existence, this technology already plays a role in many of the most significant criminal and national security threats our nation faces.”

“I think the regulatory concern that some governments have obviously is whether, say, Bitcoin or [other] cryptocurrencies will become a substitute for cash,” Barth said. This would make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy.

Still, many countries are openly embracing blockchain’s technology. China, Sweden, and Singapore, for example, have all flirted with the idea of launching digital currencies as an alternative for making payments.

Over the next few years, the cryptocurrency market is all but guaranteed to whipsaw between record highs and disappointing lows. Bitcoin, for example, has already lost some steam since last Monday’s peak, hovering around $18,250 as of this writing. Despite its volatility, however, investors remain optimistic that blockchain technology will soon revolutionize our understanding of the global economy and help create a world in which governments no longer retain a monopoly on currency.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-criminals-idUSKBN28J1IX,"FILE PHOTO: The exchange rates and logos of Bitcoin (BTH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are seen on the display of a cryptocurrency ATM of blockchain payment service provider Vaerdex at the headquarters of Swiss Falcon Private Bank in Zurich, Switzerland May 29, 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their use of cryptocurrencies to launder money, with hundreds of millions of dollars of dirty funds last year flowing through digital wallets that allow users to hide their trail, according to Elliptic.

At least 13% of all criminal proceeds in bitcoin passed through privacy wallets - which make it harder to track cryptocurrency transactions - in 2020, up from 2% in 2019, according to a study by the digital currency forensics firm.

While cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous, they are recorded on a public ledger called blockchain which makes it easier to track fund flows. Over the past decade, law enforcement has become better at tracking illicit activity on blockchains.

But privacy wallets, of which there are several types, combine, mix and anonymise cryptocurrency transactions, making it complicated to follow a money trail.

“It makes it practically impossible to track funds, especially if you do a series of transactions through privacy wallets,” said Dr Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic. “This is a big challenge for law enforcement. It means they are probably at a dead end.”

Much of the $120,000 in bitcoin raised in a hack of famous Twitter users’ accounts in July went through a privacy wallet, as did part of the $280 million in crypto assets stolen from Asian exchange KuCoin in September, Elliptic found.

The study also describes uses of decentralised exchanges - platforms that are not run by a specific company - to launder funds.

While the total volume of illicit activity in crypto assets has grown in absolute terms over the years, it accounts for less than 1% of all digital transactions, down from 35% in 2012, according to Elliptic.",2020-12-09 12:10:15+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/fidelity-crypto-arm-to-offer-clients-bitcoin-backed-cash-loans/,"In yet another sign of cryptocurrency’s emergence as a store of value, Fidelity Digital Assets will allow its customers to borrow fiat loans against as much as 60 percent of their bitcoin holdings.

Fidelity Digital Assets, the cryptocurrency arm of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, only serves institutional investors such as hedge funds, family offices and market intermediaries.

According to a Bloomberg report, the crypt-backed loans will be offered in a partnership with New York-based BlockFi, a wealth management platform for crypto investors.

Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said the new service caters to Bitcoin investors who are not ready to part with crypto assets but want to turn their digital stash into cash without selling. Based on a 60% loan to value ratio (LTV), potential customers include hedge funds, crypto miners and over-the-counter trading desks.

A number of platforms offer crypto-backed cash loans, and their popularity is growing among cryptocurrency investors who are intent on holding. BlockFi launched its service earlier in March 2019, offering loans to those interested in borrowing crypto, starting from $2,000, and up to as much as $100 million, against bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins.

BlockFi said that it saw a doubling in monthly revenue since its latest $30 million Series B funding in February. Although it did not reveal the exact figures, the New York-based crypto lender said it is on track to generate $100 million in revenue over the next year.

According to the company’s website, so far the BlockFi crypto lending platform has attracted over $1.5 billion in deposits from retail, corporate and institutional crypto investors. Additionally, BlockFi reported strong increases in earnings and a broadening of its client base as it is eyeing a more substantial footprint in Asia and elsewhere.

Fidelity’s cryptocurrency unit already features institutional-grade, crypto linked services, including custody offerings to safeguard holdings and execution services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

On a related note, Fidelity has named former Managing Director at Barclays, Chris Tyrer to lead the European business. Tyrer was tasked with developing the investment bank’s digital assets project and was previously its head of commodities trading.",2020-12-09 18:15:48+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/with-investors-expecting-a-latin-american-cryptocurrency-boom-mexicos-bitso-raises-62-million/,"Six years after the launch of the Mexico-based cryptocurrency exchange and financial services platform Bitso, the company revealed it has closed on $62 million in financing to capitalize on the cryptocurrency boom investors expect to hit Latin America.

The three major cryptocurrencies are all trading up in the waning months of 2020, with Bitcoin prices nearing (or exceeding) record highs. The global growth of these digital currencies and their applications in emerging markets have savvy financial services investors like the firm QED Investors (founded by the masterminds behind Capital One) intrigued. Which is why the firm joined the Latin American heavyweight investor Kaszek Ventures in financing Bitso’s $62 million round.

Bitso may already be the dominant cryptocurrency platform in Latin America boasting 1 million users (primarily in Mexico and Argentina) and is one of the only platforms to be licensed under the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC).

Founded by Ben Peters, Daniel Vogel and Pablo Gonzalez, the company has been dominant in the Latin America crypto market, but it has also not been able to avoid some of the controversies that surround the crypto industry.

A report from Reuters flagged Bitso as one of the platforms that criminals like the human trafficker Ignacio Santoyo were using to launder money.

The founders of Bitso and their investors focus on the ability for cryptocurrencies to reduce friction and cost in markets where financial services often ignore the middle class and low-income consumers that often need them the most.

“Crypto as an asset class was not going away and was clearly coming of age,” said Nigel Morris, the QED co-founder who previously led Capital One. “It’s not going away. And with that there are various financial services that are enabled by this asset class. You can lend against it. You can use it to move money cross-border. This thing is now palpable and real and has come of age.”

For all of those reasons, Latin America represented a big opportunity for QED Investors to make its first bet in the cryptocurrency space, and for Bitso to be that initial investment.

“This is a terrific business model and a great team and a geography that we know,” said Morris. The firm has invested in startups like Coru and Confio already and is a big believer in the opportunity for financial services startups in Mexico broadly.

For Bitso, the big opportunities are presenting Latin American investors with an opportunity to invest in foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar through stablecoin offerings alongside a slew of lending and cross-border remittance services — in addition to the peer to peer transaction services the company already offers.

Bitso already employs 200 people and intends to use the capital to expand aggressively across Latin America. The company’s first port of call will be Brazil. The largest market in the region, Brazil represents a huge untapped opportunity for Bitso’s growth, according to co-founder Daniel Vogel.

“We have really good traction building products where the central product is not exposure to bitcoin or crypto but fulfilling this vision of making crypto useful,” Vogel said. “These two investors have a lot of knowledge in the fintech space in the traditional financial services space and we’re excited to continue developing projects. We have been building some of these things out … utilizing technology for things that are useful to the end customer and developing products along those lines.”

For instance, Bitso is already processing $1 billion in remittances for customers, enabling transactions for financial services partners like cryptocurrency-enabled money transmitters.

Vogel first met QED and Kaszek when he was just getting Bitso off the ground, living and working in a hacker house that was shared with five other companies. “I had to kick my team out of the meeting from my only room,” Vogel recalled.

Now the company boasts a customer base of 1 million and with the new cash, hopes to add another 1 million Brazilian customers to the platform.

He thinks that access to stablecoins will lead the way. “There was so much uncertainty that people flocked to the dollar as a store of value,” Vogel said. “Access to dollars is something that has grown quite a bit in the last year.”",2020-12-09 00:00:00,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/09/bitwise-launches-first-cryptocurrency-index-fund/,"Bitwise Asset Management has launched the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), an open-ended publicly traded statutory trust available for investors who want exposure to a diversified group of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and others.

The fund debuted Wednesday on the OTCQX, the top tier of the over-the-counter market, with approximately $120 million in assets at just over $25 a share. By late afternoon it was trading just under $31 a share. The fund has an expense ratio of 2.5% and is available for purchase through traditional brokerage accounts at Schwab, Fidelity and other firms.

The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund tracks the Bitwise market-cap-weighted index of the 10 largest crypto assets, which are screened for liquidity, custody and other risks and rebalanced monthly, according to Bitwise.

It is the first cryptocurrency index fund available to investors through traditional brokerages such as Schwab and Fidelity, according to the company. The similarly structured Grayscale Bitcoin Trust invests in only one cryptocurrency.

As of of Nov. 30, Bitcoin accounted for 75% of the assets of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund; Ethereum 13%; and XRP, Litecoin, Chainlink, Tezos and other cryptocurrencies the remaining 12%, according to Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer.

“The start of public trading for shares of BITW will make it significantly easier for financial advisers, family offices, individuals and institutional funds to allocate to the space,” Hougan said in a statement. “We believe the fund offers a robust, one-stop solution.”

Hougan tells ThinkAdvisor that the fund is especially designed for financial advisors who would like an “safe and easy way to allocate crypto for clients that is professionally managed, secure, diversified and (perhaps most importantly) first into their workflow.”",2020-12-09 00:00:00,https://www.globalcustodian.com/standard-chartered-and-northern-trust-partner-to-launch-cryptocurrency-custodian-for-institutional-investors/,"Two of the world’s largest securities services providers have collaborated to launch Zodia, an institutional-grade custody solution for cryptocurrencies.

Standard Chartered and Northern Trust said they expect to begin operations in London in 2021 subject to registration with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), all applicable regulatory filings and customary closing conditions.

The launch represents a landmark moment for both incumbent custodians and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market alike, as the move could help facilitate institutional involvement in certain digital assets such as Bitcoin. Zodia will enable both transaction and settlement activities.

In a statement, the two custodians said that Zodia combines the traditional custody principles and expertise of a bank with the agility of a FinTech company to provide an infrastructure that meets the high standards and expectations of institutional investors through a platform that adapts to the changing needs of clients and the market.

“The introduction of digital custody backed by the know-how and experience of global banks is a breakthrough in the evolution and support of institutional cryptocurrency markets,” said Pete Cherecwich, President, Corporate & Institutional Services, Northern Trust.

Zodia’s robust capabilities will make it possible for institutional asset owners, family offices and asset managers to invest in a range of cryptocurrencies as interest continues to grow in these emerging and innovative financial instruments.”

At launch Zodia will provide custody services for the most-traded cryptocurrency assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, followed by XRP, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash – which represent the majority of client demand and activity, accounting for approximately 80% of the total assets – equivalent to $395 billion – traded on the top cryptocurrency exchanges.

“Zodia was established to address the need for a cryptocurrency custodian that truly understands custody,” said Maxime De Guillebon, Chief Executive Officer of Zodia, and part of SC Ventures, Standard Chartered’s FinTech unit. “We combine the risk management, compliance, governance and security approach of a regulated financial institution with the cutting-edge innovation of crypto asset and key management technologies. By doing so, we enable operational efficiency and speed of transaction without compromising on security or reliability.”

The launch of Zodia brings to end a long-awaited solution from an incumbent custody provider, though few would have predicted that it would come through a collaboration between two such organisations.

Both have been vocal in the past about venturing into crypto asset servicing and the launch comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin has reached record highs.

Crypto exchanges that also have a free custody offering, such as Coinbase and BitGo, have dominated this space, but in October last year, Fidelity Investments rolled out a crypto custody service dedicated to hedge funds, family offices, and financial advisors.

Traditional providers, such as State Street and BNY Mellon, have both made very gradual moves into servicing crypto assets but have avoided launching a full-fledged custody offering.

Various pieces of research have highlighted the growing demand from institutional investors, including a report of more than 500 asset managers, owners and insurers, conducted by State Street at the start of the year, which showed a quarter of firms said they are investing in digital currencies or related products such as bitcoin futures. This is up five-fold from a year ago, when just 5% of respondents said they were investing in crypto assets.

In addition, Global Custodian conducted its own research of endowment funds back in 2018, which showed the vast majority had been allocating to crypto-related investments throughout and planned to continue their activity in the next year despite lingering concerns over regulation, volatility and liquidity.

According to a survey of 150 endowments, 94% said they had invested in crypto-related initiatives in the past 12 months.",2020-12-09 08:36:54+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/france-kyc-crypto,"The French Ministry of Finance unveiled sweeping know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on all cryptocurrency companies operating in and servicing the country on Wednesday, a move that could ultimately strip the French crypto space of any semblance of anonymity.

All virtual asset service providers must immediately begin checking their customers’ identities, verifying “beneficial owners” and prohibit anonymous crypto accounts, according to the press release from Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

He called the action a necessary step in France’s fight against terrorism. The press release invoked a terrorist cell that apparently financed itself with crypto until its dismantling in September 2019. “We must drain the euro from all terrorist financing channels,” Le Maire declared in a tweet.

Massive new KYC requirements appear to be France’s first volley in a wider broadside against anonymity in crypto. The finance ministry said it is also preparing “new regulatory provisions” to fast-track “digital identification solutions” for crypto transactions.

Scarcely a news cycle goes by without some mention of Bitcoin. But even by its own standards, the cryptocurrency was having an intense moment in the fall of 2020. First, its prices on trading exchanges tumbled around Thanksgiving — only to roar back and set an all-time high of $19,857 on November 30: a 177% year-to-date increase that put the S&P 500's 14% rise to shame.

But while it has certainly attracted plenty of attention, not just of late but throughout its 11-year-old life, Bitcoin still remains a mystery to casual and experienced investors alike. This shouldn't really be the case, since the basics of Bitcoin and how it works are relatively easy to understand.

Here's a brief Bitcoin biography: An overview of its origins, operations — and how to invest in it.

What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an electronic version of money that verifies transactions using cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information).

As Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur Jimmy Song explains, Bitcoin is ""decentralized, digital, and scarce money"":

It's digital because it exists as a set of code that determines how it operates

It's decentralized because this code is run by thousands of computers (AKA 'nodes') spread across the globe

It's scarce because its code limits its overall number to only 21 million bitcoins

When you use bitcoin to buy something, it records the transaction on a blockchain, which is essentially a ledger or database whose entries can't be modified or erased.

Transactions are validated by Bitcoin through a process known as a proof-of-work, in which ""miners"" (i.e., people with computing hardware) attempt to calculate the cryptographic key for the next block in Bitcoin's blockchain.

""It's called mining because it's like looking for gold. Anyone with a shovel can dig and look for gold, just as anyone with a computer can look for proof-of-work,"" says Song.

These technicalities aside, one of the main draws of Bitcoin — and one of the reasons why it has attracted so much hype in recent years — is that it's a form of private money that operates without the involvement of a central bank or government.

""Bitcoin is used to transfer funds from one party to another without requiring a middleman such as a bank. Because the technology is open source and entirely decentralized, it is protected from influence by external sources such as governments, who typically control fiscal policy and fiat currency circulation,"" says Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro.

A brief history of Bitcoin

This independence from central authorities is key to understanding the beginnings of Bitcoin, which was first formalized by a person identified only as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" in an October 2008 whitepaper. Working with various members of a cryptography mailing list, the pseudonymous Nakamoto launched Bitcoin on January 3, 2009.

Other individuals had attempted to develop forms of electronic money before (e.g. e-Cash, DigiCash, Hashcash), but most had failed to solve the 'double-spend' problem, in which bad actors can spend the same e-money twice. Nakamoto's main solution to this problem was to introduce a timestamped, permanent transactions ledger: the blockchain.

This effectively makes every bitcoin traceable and unique, insofar as the transaction history of each individual bitcoin is publicly visible on the bitcoin blockchain. ""Any attempted alteration of the ledger would be rejected by other participants,"" says Peters.

The blockchain technology behind the Bitcoin network is what excites most people about the digital currency. Because the record-keeping technology is decentralized — so no single group has control — advocates believe it has the power to transform the world's financial institutions and business dealings for the better, resulting in faster but more secure transactions, along with improved transparency and communications.

Early uses of bitcoins

At the very beginning of its life, Bitcoin was used to make trial purchases and payments, with developer Laszlo Hanyecz famously using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas on May 22, 2010. It then became more commonly used in online marketplaces and for international contracts and import/export operations.

It was also around this time that traders first began speculating with the currency, with the now-defunct BitcoinMarket.com launching as the world's first bitcoin exchange in March 2010.

Having been worth precisely $0 when it debuted in 2009, bitcoin has experienced more than its fair share of pricing ups and downs, with its worth rising or plummeting by hundreds of dollars in a matter of hours. Still, the major trend has been that the currency's price has risen over the longer term, with each new peak being higher than the last in most cases.

Concerns over bitcoin's legitimacy

One reason for the volatility: Considerable suspicion and skepticism that have dogged the cryptocurrency throughout its history. Bitcoin's blockchain may be immune to interference, but bitcoin itself may not be, skeptics have said.

Research published in 2019 concluded that ""there was serious market manipulation in Mt. Gox exchange,"" which was the largest cryptocurrency marketplace until hacking forced its 2014 shutdown, incurring the loss of some 744,408 bitcoins.

Similar charges have been made with regards to the cryptocurrency Tether. A so-called ""stablecoin,"" it's widely used to purchase bitcoins in regions (particularly Asia) where using traditional fiat currencies for such a purpose isn't legal. Its operators originally claimed that every Tether token was backed 1:1 by US dollars held in reserve, yet researchers have suggested that this backing is a myth and that Tether is a tool used just to inflate bitcoin prices.

Then there's Bitcoin's association with criminals and shady operators. Most notoriously, it was the medium of exchange used by Silk Road, a clandestine black market eventually shut down by the FBI in 2013.

This stigma has stuck ever since, and not without cause. While recent research suggests that bitcoin is now mostly used for financial speculation or wealth preservation (much like gold), some $2.8 billion was laundered in 2019 using the cryptocurrency.

Why invest in bitcoin?

Bitcoin may be a relatively new asset, but it has provided outsized returns in almost every year of its existence. More broadly, its advocates believe that its fixed supply makes it the perfect way to store wealth and that it should appreciate significantly over the long term as more institutional investors — investment banks, mutual funds, pension plans — pile into it.

""We have already seen increased interest from institutional investors and corporations"" in 2020, says Peters. ""This is in part to the increasing view that bitcoin can act as a strong hedge against inflation in portfolios, as well as potentially growing in price and in consumer adoption substantially in the future.""

How to invest in bitcoin

There are two main ways to invest in bitcoin. Either you set up an account with one of the many dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges now in existence, or you buy it through an investment platform that includes the option to buy cryptocurrencies.

While cryptocurrency exchanges were once shady, unregulated operations, the major exchanges now operating are all regulated and in compliance with applicable laws. In the United States, some of the most popular are:

Coinbase

Kraken

Gemini

Binance.US

bitFlyer

Coinmama

Alternatively, you can buy bitcoin through a number of financial apps and platforms, including Robinhood, Cash App, and PayPal. Such apps tend not to offer as wide a selection of cryptocurrencies as the dedicated exchanges, but if you're interested only in bitcoin then it doesn't make a real difference.

If you do decide to invest in bitcoin, here are five pointers worth keeping in mind in order to reduce your exposure to risk:

1. Consider buying a bitcoin wallet

If you're buying bitcoin via an exchange, and if you're planning on holding large sums of the cryptocurrency, it may be a good idea to transfer them to your own hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are basically small, offline computers that store the private keys controlling your bitcoin funds, with good examples being manufactured by the likes of Ledger and Trezor.

2. Invest only what you can afford to lose

This sage advice applies to any investment, but especially here. Bitcoin has fluctuated quite wildly over its brief existence and continues to do so — like that $3,000 drop in prices the third week of November 2020. The moral is: Your holdings may decline significantly in the short-term, so don't invest any funds that you might need to call on for an emergency, lest you be forced to sell during one of these downswings.

3. Think long-term

Given its volatility, it usually pays to have more of a long-term perspective when investing in Bitcoin. Viewed over the past decade, it has performed extremely well, so — unless you want to take up day-trading — buying and holding it may be the best strategy.

4. Watch the stock market

Bitcoin has shown an increasing correlation with the S&P 500 in 2020, particularly as the current economic climate has pushed investors towards more speculative investments. As such, it may be worthwhile watching stocks for telltale signs of an impending movement in the bitcoin market.

5. Remember tax liabilities

In the United States, bitcoin is taxable. You are liable for capital gains tax when selling the currency at a profit, or even just spending it (if the price has appreciated since you bought it). So be sure to keep records of all your transactions.

The financial takeaway

It's hard to say where Bitcoin will be in the next five or 10 years.

Its ability to operate at scale has been seriously questioned, so it's unlikely that bitcoin will become a fully fledged currency, replacing traditional dollars or euros, anytime soon.

Still, 2020 saw the business intelligence company MicroStrategy adopt bitcoin as its primary reserve asset, with the likes of Square and UK-based fintech Mode soon following suit. It also saw PayPal launch its own cryptocurrency trading service, adding to the conviction that the momentum behind Bitcoin and crypto in general is only building.

""In my view, whilst adoption will continue to increase at a steady rate, the largest role I see bitcoin having is its increased use as an asset in investment portfolios,"" says Simon Peters. Some bullish analysts have set fairly astronomical target for price increases, with former Goldman Sachs hedge-fund chief Raoul Paul going as high as $1 million by 2025.

Given that bitcoin has no real fundamentals besides a limited supply and a growing network of developers, users and holders, it's hard to fully subscribe to such optimistic forecasts. Nonetheless, past years have been very kind to the cryptocurrency, and there are no real signs that its bubble (if it is a bubble) is going to burst just yet.

After the COVID-19 pandemic caused chaos in the global economy, it seems that more and more people started taking cryptocurrency more seriously than ever before.

As a result, both capital and attention were showered onto the crypto space: now, nearing the end of the year, Bitcoin has held sustainable price levels close to $20k; the DeFi space has held onto an influx of new funds and new users, and major corporations have announced huge investments into cryptocurrencies.

If the past can tell us anything about the future, 2021 may be a very exciting year for crypto. So, before we look into the future, let’s peer into the past. Here are 5 of the most important crypto trends of 2020.

Bitcoin’s Status as a Hedge against USD Inflation Is More Widely Accepted

Perhaps the most significant thing that happened in 2020 is the fact that more and more people seemed to begin to see cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against inflation.

Indeed, Brandon Mintz, Chief Executive of Bitcoin Depot, told Finance Magnates that “one of the most alarming developments of the last year was the revelation that the Fed printed an incredible amount of money – more than 20 percent of all dollars were printed in the last year.”

A number of analysts believe that “this leads to fear of hyperinflation and instability,” he added. “On the other hand, BTC is on an aggressive growth trajectory.”

“There is a finite supply of BTC and it’s been referred to as digital gold, similar to the days when the value of the dollar was directly linked to the fixed supply of gold in federal reserves,” Mintz explained.

“This means that, despite its reputation for volatility, BTC could be more stable than the dollar at times, especially for savvy individuals looking to diversify their assets. As the adoption rate increases, the value will only continue to rise.”

Investors Are Showing Increased Interest in Bitcoin as a Portfolio Optimizer

Beyond Bitcoin’s increasing popularity as a possible hedge against inflation, Steve Ehrlich, Chief Executive of crypto broker Voyager, told Finance Magnates that crypto is becoming more popular as a portfolio optimizer.

“At Voyager, we’ve seen retail investors rushing in to convert their cash into crypto, to build their digital asset portfolio and build wealth by earning compounding interest,” he said, adding that “we expect this adoption to skyrocket in 2021 by all the trends we are witnessing.”

“With PayPal and other major financial services also introducing digital assets, Grayscale buying more Bitcoin than is being minted on a weekly basis, mass adoption of crypto is no longer a hopeful dream, it’s a reality which is coming to fruition,” he explained.

“It’s also anticipated that the U.S. Dollar is expected to continue to weaken into 2021, and more dollars being printed to stimulate the economy, which will in turn likely push Bitcoin’s price into record-breaking territory.”

“Defi Has Grown from USD$1 Billion in ‘Locked’ Assets to over $14 Billion in This Year Alone.”

Another very important part of 2020 was the advent of the decentralized finance space, also known as DeFi. During the months of June and July, money poured into DeFi; as a result, the prices of tokens associated with DeFi platforms skyrocketed.

To a large extent, token prices have corrected since then. However, the growth that has occurred in the DeFi space is impressive nonetheless.

“Defi has grown from USD$1 billion in ‘locked’ assets to over $14 billion in this year alone,” said Steven Becker, Chief Operating Officer and President of the Maker Foundation, to Finance Magnates.

This is because users “clearly see the value in increased accessibility and transparency to the economy,” Becker said. After all, the principles of DeFi are such that traditional financial systems can be rebuilt on more transparent, decentralized, peer-to-peer “rails.”

Still, DeFi is a long way from real adoption. While the amount of capital locked in DeFi systems may be increasing at lightning speed, the growth number of users has happened at a much slower pace.

However, Becker believes that progress is underway: “next year we’ll begin to see increased investing from traditional finance leaders as DeFi projects tackle major roadblocks in the current economy,” he said.

“As the world navigates the pandemic’s impact on the economy, I believe DeFi has the power of versatility and adaptability to move quickly and efficiently in times of financial crisis,” he said. As such, “we’ll continue to see more use cases surface including opening up the market for greater financial inclusion.”

However, Vadim Anchugov, Chief Operating Officer at Luxembourg-based digital asset investment platform VNX, pointed out that while “DeFi is a truly amazing innovation,” it may be wise to “be a little bit cautious before assuming that its success will be long-living.”

“[…]Obviously, we’re in the hype stage of DeFi now similar to the ICO boom of 2017, and that will end eventually, but whether the DeFi platforms will become more mature or just decline afterwards remains to be seen,” he said.

CBDCs Have “Arrived”

Another major area of progress this year was the rise in popularity of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs.) All around the globe, governments and central banks alike began explorative studies, trials and even launches of central bank digital currencies.

Indeed, Anchugov pointed out to Finance Magnates that “this year, a huge step closer to adoption of central banks’ stable coins (known as Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs) was made.”

“We saw an increasing number of countries and central banks running assessments, developing practical steps to develop CBDC adoption,” he said.

Earlier this year, Reuben Yap, Project Steward of Firo (formerly Zcoin), told Finance Magnates that CBDCs seemed to have “arrived” in 2020.

Why now? “Distributed ledger technology has matured significantly to a point that CBDCs are now possible,” he said. “China’s aggressive move with their DCEP initiative as part of its vision and the internationalization of RMB along with Libra’s efforts have raised many eyebrows, so much so that many central banks may be worried that they’ll get left behind.”

Maurizio Raffone, Chief Financial Officer of Credify, also told Finance Magnates that CBDCs are taking a big step forward now “due to a convergence of factors.”

“Distributed-ledger technology is now well-proven and beyond the ‘proof-of-concept’ stage, the Central Banks’ drive to reduce infrastructure costs for the banking sector and the greater focus on tools to combat money laundering and criminal financings,” he said.

2020 Was a Big Year for Regulatory Progress in Crypto

“In 2020, the crypto industry took a quantum leap forward,” said Ehrlich to Finance Magnates, specifically mentioning that “regulatory clarity” played an important part in paving “the path to mass adoption.”

Mintz specifically pointed to the open letter that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published in July of 2020.

The letter “granted banks the ability to hold crypto assets on behalf of customers signaling that mainstream acceptance of BTC has begun to occur, and that BTC is beginning to revolutionize the economy as we know it,” Mintz said.

As a result, in 2021 and beyond, “we expect to see payments made with BTC become more commonplace and a rapid adoption of ‘crypto cards’. These cards will allow users to spend bitcoin through traditional payment networks and then those networks will pay merchants in fiat currency.”

In Europe, Anchugov pointed out that “2020 signified a new step in the crypto era of the European Union as the European Commission introduced a draft regulation on Market In Crypto Assets (MiCA),” which finally gave national governments of the EU member countries an understanding of what a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies should look like in the future.

Additionally, MiCA gave “businesses operating in a crypto-related sphere a predictable perspective of the requirements, which allows them to adjust their business models and forecast possible impacts from both a business and a financial perspective,” as well as “licensing and compliance regimes with the new laws.”

Proof-of-Stake Became Much More Prominent throughout 2020

2020 was also a year that saw a shift in the mechanics of the blockchain sphere. Indeed, Tim Ogilvie, Chief Executive of Staked, told Finance Magnates that “the most important trend in crypto in 2020 saw Proof of Stake blockchains come to the fore in a shift that will accelerate next year.”

“Currently representing about 15% of the total crypto market cap, proof-of-stake blockchains drive most of the activity outside bitcoin, and we can expect this to accelerate in 2021,” Ogilvie said. “This dominance will expand and spur further adoption and developer engagement, which in turn will help foster many more user-facing projects and apps.”

The term Proof-of-Stake describes a type of blockchain algorithm that keeps blockchain networks operable by incentivizing users to ‘lock’ their coins into a network; by contrast, Proof-of-Work algorithms (like Bitcoin’s) incentivize users to have the most powerful computing equipment.

Indeed, “almost half of the top ten crypto assets by market cap are now on a path to Proof-of-Stake,” Ogilvie explained. “At the beginning of the year, there were practically none.”

Additionally, “a lot of 2020’s crypto market cap growth can be attributed to proof-of-stake blockchains, such as Ethereum, Polkadot and Cardano,” he said.

Moreover, Ogilvie pointed to a major development in the life cycle of Ethereum: “this month’s launch of the Beacon Chain as part of the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 was the biggest event in staking this year,” he said.

“The fact that the blockchain with a market cap second only to Bitcoin is finally moving to proof-of-stake underscores the shift.”

“Other PoS networks are recording successes, too,” he added. “Polkadot has more than $3 billion staked and is currently the largest PoS chain. Chainlink, the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap, has announced that it too plans to shift to PoS. In 12 months time, we will see that many of the top chains, outside of Bitcoin, will have moved to proof-of-stake.”

The DBS Digital Exchange will use blockchain technology to provide a platform for fundraising through asset tokenisation and secondary trading of digital assets, the bank said in a statement on Thursday.

The tokenisation process represents converting rights to an underlying asset class such as shares of unlisted companies and private equity funds into a unique digital form, which then becomes eligible for trading.

DBS said Singapore Exchange will take a 10% stake in the digital exchange, while the rest will be owned by the bank.

The DBS Digital Exchange is 10% owned by Singapore’s SGX stock exchange. It will also provide tokenization of securities and other assets, as well as bank-grade custody for digital assets.

The new exchange will facilitate spot exchanges from fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies and vice versa, said Piyush Gupta, DBS Group CEO on a media call, Thursday.

Four fiat currencies (SGD, USD, HKD, JPY) will be tradable against four of the most established cryptocurrencies covering 70%-80% of the market, namely bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and XRP, Gupta added.

“We are ready to begin crypto trading as early as next week,” said Gupta. “Security token offerings may take a month or two to get started – but in summary we are ready to go.”

The security token offering part of the digital exchange will comprise a regulated platform for the issuance and trading of digital tokens backed by financial assets, such as shares in unlisted companies, bonds and private equity funds.

“You can tokenize anything, you can tokenize a painting. But for now, we will be concentrating on financial assets.” Gupta said.

The third part is custody, which is said to be bank and institutional grade. This will be air-gapped cold storage that leverages all the existing cyber security tech at the bank, according to the CEO.

Interestingly, Swiss digital exchange SDX said this week it would also be building a crypto exchange in Singapore with Japan’s SBI Holdings, slated for launch in 2022.

The DBS exchange will only be open to institutional clients and accredited investors, Gupta said.",2020-12-10 10:17:46+00:00,https://www.investopedia.com/gold-will-suffer-as-bitcoin-catches-on-jpmorgan-5091647,"A new note from strategists at investment bank JPMorgan has warned that the value of gold will ""suffer"" as institutional investors move funds away from gold and into cryptocurrency funds. According to authors of the note, which lays out a bullish case for cryptocurrencies, gold will face a ""structural flow headwind"" as investors shift allegiance and money to Bitcoin (BTCUSD). The report does not provide a timeline for this event.

Bitcoin accounts for only 0.18% of assets held at family offices, the note's authors write. That amount is a fraction of the 3.3% of the total funds set aside for gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A change of strategy from gold to Bitcoin at family offices will represent the transfer of billions of dollars in cash.

Key Takeaways JPMorgan analysts predict that gold prices will suffer and face headwinds when investors move funds from gold to Bitcoin ETFs.

The note comes on the back of record inflows into Bitcoin investing products.

Investors and traders should remember that the size and scope of both markets, in their current form, are different.

""The adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced,"" the strategists wrote. ""If this medium to longer term thesis proves right, the price of gold would suffer from a structural flow headwind in the coming years."" In the near term, Bitcoin price is ""skewed to the downside.""

While the bank's CEO has made remarks critical of Bitcoin, analysts at JPMorgan have been fairly optimistic about the cryptocurrency's prospects. As far back as 2018, in the midst of a slump in cryptocurrency markets and a growing chorus questioning their viability as trading venues, the analysts predicted that cryptocurrencies were ""here to stay.""

At the beginning of this year, JPMorgan analysts highlighted the potential of stablecoins as a payment mechanism. More recently, when Bitcoin price was hovering around the $13,000 mark in October, they suggested a ""doubling"" or ""tripling"" in its price due to the cryptocurrency's popularity as digital gold. The bank's latest missive comes just after Bitcoin reached a peak in its prices. Investment activity has also picked up, and Grayscale, the biggest investing fund company for cryptocurrencies, has witnessed record inflows this year on the back of higher market prices.

To be sure, Bitcoin has indeed outperformed gold this year as an asset. However, that comparison does not take into account the size and scope of the respective markets. JPMorgan's October report estimated that the precious metal was worth $2.6 trillion, including its physical assets held as bars and coins, while Bitcoin had a valuation of $240 billion.

Gold has been around for centuries as a safe haven from monetary turmoil. In contrast, Bitcoin is less than 15 years old. That said, as the markets mature for Bitcoin and, by extension, other cryptocurrencies, there is a good chance that family offices will become more comfortable with them.",2020-12-10 16:39:12.271000+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/169-year-old-insurer-massmutual-invests-100-million-in-bitcoin,"Why did this happen?

Both banks said they expect to begin operations in London in 2021 subject to registration with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), all applicable regulatory filings and customary closing conditions.

The launch represents a landmark moment for the institutions and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market alike, as the move could help facilitate institutional involvement in certain digital assets such as Bitcoin. Zodia will enable both transaction and settlement activities.

In a statement, the two banks said that Zodia combines the traditional custody principles and expertise of a bank with the agility of a FinTech company to provide an infrastructure that meets the high standards and expectations of institutional investors through a platform that adapts to the changing needs of clients and the market.

“The introduction of digital custody backed by the know-how and experience of global banks is a breakthrough in the evolution and support of institutional cryptocurrency markets,” said Pete Cherecwich, president of corporate and institutional services at Northern Trust.

“Zodia’s robust capabilities will make it possible for institutional asset owners, family offices and asset managers to invest in a range of cryptocurrencies as interest continues to grow in these emerging and innovative financial instruments.”

At launch Zodia will provide custody services for the most-traded cryptocurrency assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, followed by XRP, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash – which represent the majority of client demand and activity, accounting for approximately 80% of the total assets – equivalent to $395 billion – traded on the top cryptocurrency exchanges.

“Zodia was established to address the need for a cryptocurrency custodian that truly understands custody,” said Maxime De Guillebon, CEO of Zodia, and part of SC Ventures, Standard Chartered’s FinTech unit.

“We combine the risk management, compliance, governance and security approach of a regulated financial institution with the cutting-edge innovation of crypto asset and key management technologies. By doing so, we enable operational efficiency and speed of transaction without compromising on security or reliability.”

The launch of Zodia brings to end a long-awaited solution from an incumbent custody provider, though few would have predicted that it would come through a collaboration between two such organisations.

Both have been vocal in the past about venturing into crypto asset servicing and the launch comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin has reached record highs.

Bitwise's large-cap index fund, the Bitwise 10 Index Fund (BITW), is listed on OTCQX and can be traded using brokerage accounts. The fund has $120 million in assets under management and will track the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, which is a market capitalization-weighted index holding 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies, representing 80% of the overall value of crypto markets.

Its top holdings, as of this writing, are Bitcoin (75%) and Ether (13%), and the rest consists of other cryptocurrencies such as XRP and litecoin. According to the company's press release, the fund was up by 184% in value this year. Bitwise has partnered with Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, for custody of its assets.

Key Takeaways Developed by Bitwise, the Bitwise 10 Index Fund (BITW) is the first crypto index fund listed on OTC markets.

The fund is intended to expand the universe of crypto investing products and is aimed at financial advisors.

A Product Aimed at Financial Advisors

Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, most investment products using them are for accredited investors, or investors who have a much higher tolerance for risk than retail investors. Such products are often expensive and trade at a premium because they provide access to Bitcoin, a scarce asset whose value has increased in the past couple of months.

Bitwise also followed the tried-and-tested route and already has funds aimed at the same category of investors. However, this is the company's first foray into designing an investment vehicle aimed at financial advisors and, by extension, retail investors. Bitwise had previously submitted applications for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), but the SEC rejected those applications.

Thus far, financial advisors have been hesitant to recommend Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies to their clients, but Bitwise has a theory for why this is so. ""Financial advisors are eager for a safe and easy way to allocate to crypto for clients,"" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, told Coindesk, adding that the fund's diversified nature meant that it will help investors gain exposures to other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

Hougan also made special mention of the differences between BITW another popular crypto investment vehicle, Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). The latter, which is also traded on OTC markets, does not track an index and has a management fee that is higher than that of Bitwise's fund. Those differences, however, add diversity to the crypto-investing products available in the current market.",2020-12-10 16:39:56.327000+00:00

But the cryptocurrency’s price wasn’t the only thing that sky-rocketed this year. A report from Electric Capital indicated that software developers are flocking back to the cryptocurrency world at a level not seen since the market last peaked three years ago.

A Bloomberg report, citing Electric, said the number of new developers increased this year for more than three months in a row for the first time since 2017 — in a turbulent market at the mercy of speculation, the new in-flow of coders is regarded as a promising bellwether for the technology.

Earlier this year, Linkedin‘s Top 10 ‘Hard Skills’ of 2020 chalked up blockchain as the most sought-after tech skill in 2020. Additionally, with so-called decentralized finance, or ‘DeFi’ projects taking off with promises of quick money to be made, coders have dived back in.

The promise of blockchain — essentially a shared digital ledger — is huge. Advocates see it as a secure, decentralized, and cost- and time-efficient way to transparently track shipments and transactions of all kinds. Skeptics, and there are many, raise concerns about the lack of standardized protocols, scalability, and excessive energy use (Bitcoin alone consumes as much energy as the nation of Switzerland).

However, the business world has taken a gamble on its potential, attracting firms like IBM, Oracle, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Nestle, among many others. Blockchain is used in industries from shipping to healthcare, from farming and food safety to entertainment and gaming.

The rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which doesn’t rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum, has also provided new, lucrative opportunities for blockchain developers.

The return of coders

In the first 10 months of the year, the number of new monthly crypto developers rose 15%, according to Electric, with more than 80% of all active developers beginning their work in the last two years, the firm said.

“Developers are one of the signals of quality in a crypto ecosystem. In order for there to be network security or applications, developers need to build. Many projects like smart contract platforms rely on developers joining their ecosystem to be successful. Ethereum has more activity and this is why other platforms fight for developers. You need developers to build applications and have activity on-chain,” Electric partner Maria Shen said.

Indeed, the Electric report found that coders are gravitating to Ethereum and DeFi applications with the former seeing more than 300 developers join per month. Monthly active developers focused on DeFi — letting app users lend, trade, and borrow their coins — have ballooned by 67% since January, the report stated. The total pool of active crypto developers is about 9,000 a month, and DeFi attracted more than 900 developers in October.

“In decentralized finance, developers have seen they can launch a protocol and very quickly get usage,” Shen said.

Bitcoin monthly active developers, in particular, grew by more than 70% in the last three years, although their numbers are down nearly 12% in October year-over-year, Electric found. It was also noticed that while developers flocked to top-200 projects by network value, all others lost supporters. Among projects that managed to draw more developers was Ethereum rival Polkadot and Tezos, and DeFi projects such as crypto exchange Uniswap and tools provider Chainlink.

The report also stated that EOS, which claims to have raised US$4 billion through an ICO, has seen its developer interest decline by 45% in the third quarter, with only 107 developers remaining.",2020-12-11 10:42:30+00:00,https://www.pionline.com/money-management/massmutual-buys-100-million-bitcoin-invests-cryptocurrency-firm,"Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. has purchased $100 million in bitcoin and a minority stake in NYDIG, a firm that provides institutional investment and custodial services for cryptocurrency, the companies announced Thursday.

MassMutual made a $5 million equity investment in NYDIG along with the $100 million bitcoin purchase for its general investment account in a transaction facilitated by NYDIG, according to a news release.

MassMutual's general investment account had nearly $235 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.

""We believe that having an equity stake in NYDIG as well as a bitcoin position in our general investment account will help us deliver long-term value to our policyowners,"" said Tim Corbett, chief investment officer at MassMutual, in the news release. ""We look forward to further exploring additional ways to work with NYDIG, consistent with our ongoing focus on innovation and diversification.""

NYDIG now has more than $2.3 billion of digital asset balances under custody.

Robert Gutmann, co-founder and CEO of NYDIG, said in the news release that the MassMutual investment underscores his company's role as a leading provider of bitcoin solutions to institutions, banks and private clients. ""This reflects the expansion of bitcoin to insurance company general investment accounts, as well as NYDIG's unique ability to meet the complex needs of the most demanding institutional investors,"" Mr. Gutmann said.",2020-12-11 12:10:34-05:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/12/11/confirmed-major-bank-in-singapore-launching-crypto-exchange-featuring-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-and-bitcoin-cash/,"The largest bank in Singapore has confirmed it plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange featuring four of the largest digital assets by market cap.

DBS Bank says its exchange will allow institutional and accredited investors to trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The platform has received the go-ahead from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

DBS CEO Piyush Gupta says the bridging of crypto assets and the banking system is a big boost for Singapore, which is currently ranked as the fifth largest financial center in the world.

“The exponential pace of asset digitalization provides immense opportunities to reshape capital markets. For Singapore to become even more competitive as a global financial hub, we have to prepare ourselves to welcome the mainstream adoption of digital assets and currency trading.

DBS is committed to accelerating the development of a fully integrated ecosystem to facilitate this. We believe that this is the first of its kind integrated offering, which is differentiated in many ways.”

The digital exchange will offer exchange crypto services between four fiat currency pairs – the Singapore dollar, US dollar, Hong Kong dollar and Japanese yen.

So far, a firm launch date has not been made public.

According to data circulating from crypto analytics firm bybt, on December 8th, Grayscale added 131,402 Ethereum worth approximately $74 million and 1,313 Bitcoin worth approximately $24 million on December 9th. Both acquisitions occurred over the course of two separate 24-hour periods.

The firm’s large ETH purchase supports Grayscale Investments managing director Michael Sonnenshein’s observations that an increasing number of institutional investors are seeking exposure to Ethereum and only Ethereum.

“Over the course of 2020, we are seeing a new group of investors who are Ethereum-first and in some cases Ethereum-only. There’s a growing conviction around Ethereum as an asset class.

Grayscale Ethereum Trust has garnered the attention of a new segment of Ethereum-focused institutional allocators. During 3Q20, over 17% of inflows into the Grayscale Ethereum Trust came from new institutional investors.”

Sonnenshein also says that, from what he has witnessed at Grayscale, institutional interest in Bitcoin is by no means slowing down, suggesting that its recent bull run still has gas left in the tank.

As of December 10th, Grayscale’s ETH assets under management (AUM) total $1.66 billion and its BTC AUM total $10.15 billion also according to bybt’s data. As of December 10th Grayscale’s own data shows that its AUM totals $12.2 billion.

Called Zodia, the new service will begin operations in 2021. It will provide custody services for the five most traded cryptocurrency assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash – which together represent 80% of the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market.

""The introduction of digital custody backed by the know-how and experience of global banks is a breakthrough in the evolution and support of institutional cryptocurrency markets,"" stated Pete Cherecwich, president of Corporate & Institutional Services at Northern Trust.

Key Takeaways Standard Chartered and Northern Trust are partnering to launch a crypto custody solution next year.

Standard Chartered is also reported to be prepping to launch a crypto trading solution next month.

These moves are part of a broader re-evaluation of crypto markets by institutional investors.

Northern Trust has been testing custody solutions for the market since 2018. Back then, the Chicago-based asset management giant said it was ""developing a way"" to offer custody services at a cheaper cost to competitors in the market. Subsequently, it expanded its roster of crypto services to include Net Asset Value (NAV) pricing arrangements, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and crypto-trade reconciliation.

A Crypto Trading Platform at Standard Chartered

Separately, Standard Chartered is also developing a crypto trading platform for the institutional market. Online publication Coindesk quotes anonymous sources as saying that the service will launch as soon as next month. The bank has partnered with ""five of the biggest traders in digital assets and four exchanges"" for the venture and plans to launch it with an Ethereum ERC-20 token that will function as a stablecoin or medium for transactions within the trading platform.

""We are building our own token of fiat collateral and hoping that will become the equivalent of Tether, except that the tokenized collateral or money will be held in the trading bank account of a proper bank, like a Standard Chartered, a JPMorgan, a Deutsche Bank,"" the source told Coindesk.

Standard Chartered and Northern Trust join Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.

Trading volumes for Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum shares and Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund surpass traditional stocks on top U.S. OTC markets.

Traders Scoop Crypto on OTC Markets

OTC Markets Group Inc. shares trade on leading brokerage desks like Fidelity, Schwab, E*Trade, and TD Ameritrade.

The OTC Markets Group Inc. is the operator of the largest OTC markets in the U.S. It trades in over 11,000 different securities.

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ranks on the top of the list with over $250 million in trading volume.

The number three asset, Bitwise’s crypto index, was launched only two days ago. Since then, the fund has reported higher volumes than Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

Stocks that trade on OTC markets represent smaller or foreign companies and commodities. These usually fail to obtain a listing on mainstream exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ.

The daily volume on the OTC market is $2.3 billion. In comparison, the daily volume on NASDAQ ranges around $200 billion.

The crypto shares are trading at a significant premium (up to 3,000%) over the net asset value (NAV) of the cryptocurrencies they represent. The premiums act as a proxy for the hyped retail interest in these shares.

It would now appear that traditional investors are joining.

Top institutions such as State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Yes Bank are allowing customers to use their bank accounts to fund cryptocurrency trading. They are further offering various facilities to cryptocurrency exchanges, sources familiar with the matter told The Economic Times.

Accounts of major exchanges had been suspended after the Reserve Bank of India issued an order barring banks from using their systems for cryptocurrency-related transactions in April 2018. The ban was quashed by the Supreme Court earlier this year.

“Banks earlier took a cautious approach even after the supreme court overruled the central bank’s crypto ban in March.” Gaurav Dahake, founder and CEO of Bangalore-based exchange Bitbns, told CoinDesk in an email. “But with time and price momentum around bitcoin, a lot more clients started demanding them to open up an account specific to crypto trading and banks have started opening them up now.”

Bitcoin recently rose to a new record high of $19,920, topping the previous peak price of $19,783 reached in December 2017.

Sumit Gupta, CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, confirmed via WhatsApp that his exchange has been collaborating with multiple banking partners to build and develop business services ever since the Supreme Court order was overturned.

Meanwhile, Nischal Shetty, CEO of Binance-backed cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, told CoinDesk that banks have reached out to the company to offer working capital or other loans and financial services.

Nevertheless, it'll probably go down as a largely positive year for investors. After losing more than a third of its value during the first quarter, the benchmark S&P 500 is now on track to deliver gains of more than 14% for the year.

But most equities can't hold a candle to what cryptocurrencies have done in 2020. After beginning the year with an aggregate digital-currency market cap of $191.5 billion, the combined valued of more than 7,900 cryptocurrencies as of Dec. 9 topped $551 billion. This 188% year-to-date gain in total market value has been largely fueled by bitcoin.

Having recently eclipsed a new all-time closing high, the world's largest digital token by market cap is up approximately 153% on a year-to-date basis. Bitcoin has benefited from multiyear lows in the U.S. dollar (some investors view bitcoin as an intriguing store of value) as well as an aversion to cash during the pandemic. We were already witnessing a shift toward cashless payments prior to COVID-19. The pandemic has merely accelerated this ongoing trend.

Yet, a broader look at the crypto space shows that a number of popular digital currencies ran circles around bitcoin in 2020, based on year-to-date performance.

NEM: Up 535%

Among the largest and most popular digital tokens, NEM's XEM token has been one of the top performers. Its 535% year-to-date gain more than triples up what bitcoin has delivered for its investors in 2020.

What sets NEM apart from other cryptocurrencies is its Smart Asset System, which allows its blockchain technology to be easily customized to meet a business' needs. For example, swapping out traditional payment platforms for blockchain will likely be time-consuming, costly, and burdensome. NEM's architecture helps to resolve this problem by allowing its blockchain to be open and decentralized or permissioned and private, depending on what a business desires.

NEM's Smart Asset System can also be used as an authentication service with cryptographic signatures. This is a fancy of way of saying that actions can be permissioned ahead of time to empower Internet of Things (IoT) devices to operate at peak efficiency.

NEM has announced numerous partnerships over the past couple of years. But none has garnered more buzz than its partnership with StakeHound, which culminated in the launch of stakedXEM in the decentralized finance ecosystem on Ethereum on Monday, Dec. 7.

Ethereum: Up 321%

Speaking of Ethereum, the Ether token has more than doubled up bitcoin's gain in 2020. But unlike bitcoin, which is valued for its transactional appeal, the optimism surrounding Ether has everything to do with its underlying blockchain technology.

The reason Ethereum's blockchain is so popular is its usage of smart contracts. Instead of its underlying ledger bound to currency-only transactions, Ethereum's smart contracts allow for the management of agreements between two users. Similar to how NEM's Smart Asset System allows actions to be taken by IoT devices, Ethereum's smart contracts allow for actions to occur when certain conditions are met between two parties. The use of smart contracts could completely revolutionize how companies manage and track their supply chains.

Ethereum is also being bolstered by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). The EEA has over 200 well-known companies as partners that are looking to drive adoption and collaborative opportunities for Ethereum's blockchain. These include money-center giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which launched its Ethereum-backed Interbank Information Network (IIN) in 2018. JPMorgan's IIN is a scalable, peer-to-peer network that's aiming to reduce hurdles in cross-border payments and allow for the seamless sharing of information between banks.

Beyond currency-only transactions, Ethereum's blockchain is arguably generating the most buzz.

Cardano: Up 307%

Crypto investors have also seen Cardano's Ada token blow bitcoin out of the water this year. Ada's 307% ascent more than doubles the return of the world's most popular digital token.

To keep with the ongoing theme here, investors appear to be really excited about the ongoing reinvestment in developing Cardano's blockchain. In late July, the Cardano team launched Shelley, which will allow more nodes to be run by network participants. In other words, Shelley is designed to vastly increase decentralization of the network, presumably making it more secure.

Engineers are also hard at work on Goguen and Voltaire, which are the respective next steps in differentiating the Cardano blockchain. Goguen is especially important, as it'll bring smart contracts to the network. The goal of developers is to create a smart contract that's accessible to a wider audience of businesses and subject matter experts (i.e., those without an understanding of programming). Beyond improved functionality, Goguen should also support new tokens on its platform.

A word to the wise

While crypto gains in 2020 are bringing back vivid memories of 2017 and 2018, people who believe cryptocurrency is a good investment need to understand the incredible risks they're taking on by putting their money to work in digital tokens.

One of the biggest issues is that blockchain adoption is far from a certainty. Blockchain technology finds itself in a Catch-22. It needs businesses to test-drive the technology to prove its efficacy and encourage adoption. However, no businesses are willing to make the broad-scale switch to blockchain without it being a proven technology in the real world. For now, blockchain remains a novel idea that's still a long way away from having game-changing potential for financial and nonfinancial institutions.

Investing in cryptocurrencies also involves tax and legal risks. The Internal Revenue Service expects digital token owners to pay capital gains tax. If you're an investor or trader in digital currencies, this makes sense. But if you're using bitcoin to buy other goods or services, you'll still need to pay capital gains tax based on the current value of bitcoin tokens at the time of your transaction. Additionally, should your tokens be stolen by hackers, the Securities and Exchange Commission can do little to recover what's lost.

Investing in crypto looks to be nothing but a dart throw, and it's quite possible another bubble is brewing.",2020-12-12 00:00:00,https://fortune.com/2020/12/12/bitcoin-jobs-cryptocurrency-mining-hiring-core-scientific/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-12-12 00:00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/12/170200-ethereum-gaining-interest-as-institutional-asset-class-as-decentralized-finance-gets-boost-with-bitcoin-focused-defi-platform-report/,"Ethereum (ETH), the world’s largest smart contract platform, and major decentralized finance (DeFi) assets have dropped during the past week. However, DeFi-related infrastructure is getting a boost from Bitcoin (BTC), according to a report from OKCoin.

During the last week, top DeFi platforms such as Yearn.finance (YFI) and Aave (AAVE) faced moderate price corrections while some smaller-cap initiatives experienced strong gains.

The report from OKCoin noted:

“The fundamentals of the DeFi space continued to gain strength… The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade saw further support from users while individual protocols announced positive developments. The space also got a big boost with a group of developers launching a Bitcoin-focused DeFi platform to attract BTC holders.”

The report added:

“Ethereum is gaining interest as an institutional asset class, according to a Grayscale executive. ETH2 continued to gain traction this past week, with users continuing to deposit capital into the upgrade’s deposit contract.”

Ethereum is trading at around $557 at the time of writing, down from last week’s highs of a little over $600. Leading DeFi coins such as YFI, Uniswap’s UNI token, Ren Network’s REN, and Chainlink (LINK) are among the DeFi coins that were down by double digits this past week, the OKCoin report confirmed. It also mentioned that the only large-cap DeFi asset “spared” by the drop was Compound (COMP), which might be “benefiting from rumors” regarding a planned update to its protocol.

Qiao Wang, a prominent crypto analyst, stated:

“Recap of what I think happened. The mindshare of every informed alt player was on DeFi. But everyone was too afraid to buy on the way down. A game of chicken. Then everyone piled in at the first sign of strength. Today many are still in disbelief. But all mindshare is on DeFi. The liquidity in DeFi is simply not big enough to accommodate all of them. Hence the massive high-volume V-shaped recovery.”

Digital asset exchange Binance notes in a separate report that following last week’s all-time-high for BTC, this week marked a period of market correction for crypto-assets. Bitcoin had been trading above $19,000 for most of Saturday to Tuesday, which was right “before two major falls sent the price as low as $17,900 on Wednesday and then $17,640 on Friday, before closing the week at barely above $18,000,” the report from Binance confirmed. BTC is trading at over $18,300 at the time of writing.

The Binance crypto market report added:

“Most of the altcoin (alternative coins besides Bitcoin or BTC) market also reflected Bitcoin’s slight decline. Ethereum fell from $590 to as low as $570 on Saturday, before recapturing $600 on Sunday. After a sideways market for most of the week, Ethereum sank to $540 on Wednesday and ended the week at $550. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) was mostly at the $20 to $30 range to start the week, before dropping to as low as $26.80 on Friday before recovering to $27.30 to close the week.”

The cryptocurrency ecosystem’s total market cap ranged between $548 billion and $575 billion for most of the past week, before dropping as low as $520 billion on Friday (December 11, 2020), the report noted.

It’s worth noting that US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce has recently commented on the nascent crypto and DeFi space.

Peirce remarked:",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-mom-s-house-to-warehouse-bitcoin-mining-is-going-industrial,"Bitcoin mining started out as a small endeavor taken on by a few individuals repurposing home computers to mint virtual coins that were, at the time, almost worthless. Fast forward to 2020, and Bitcoin (BTC) mining has become a formidable industry of its own, constantly growing and evolving alongside Bitcoin itself.

Today, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate is sitting at around 129 EH/s, acting in a similar way to the price of Bitcoin, even following the halving in October this year that saw the mining reward cut in half. James Bennett, CEO of ByteTree crypto data provider, told Cointelegraph that the trend is likely to continue: “The investment into Bitcoin’s network infrastructure is clear. You only need to look at the series of all-time-highs of network difficulty to see the rate new mining capacity is being added.” So, here’s how the mining industry is changing and maturing.

Public companies joining in

There has been a trend of high-profile investors, both companies and individuals, investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This is also becoming true for Bitcoin mining as public corporations, including Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital and others, venture into the industry and related activities.

As profits from Bitcoin mining rise back to their pre-halving levels, it makes sense why companies and individuals alike would want to invest in Bitcoin mining as an additional income stream, especially given that it proved to be fairly immune to the encumberments created by the coronavirus pandemic and widespread lockdowns. Whit Gibbs, host of the Hashr8 podcast, told Cointelegraph on the matter:

“A number of large companies have been exposed to Bitcoin mining for quite some time. Most notable of these is Fidelity. They have not only established mining operations, they have also been huge proponents of research and education in the industry. Another notable company with active mining interests is Horizon Kinetics.”

Access to capital

With new participants joining the industry, access to capital is imperative, and many digital-asset liquidity companies — such as Blockfills, Nexo and others — now cater to Bitcoin miners. This allows miners to expand their operations and have some wiggle room when they don’t want to sell Bitcoin for a low price.

Blockfills, for example, announced in May that it would be providing financial solutions to mining companies that wish to purchase new-generation ASIC mining equipment in North America. Since then, Blockfills has committed roughly $50 million in financial support to these miners. Neil Van Huis, partner and director at Blockfills, told Cointelegraph:

“Financial support is a primary function of any growing asset class. Our objective is to continue bringing traditional practices to our rapidly growing sector which fill voids and advance the space. $50M is really just the beginning. We have another $50–70M to get finished in the next few months and expect that we could have as much as $250M done by May of 2021.”

In addition, miners have been subject to the volatility of Bitcoin. Hedging options were not previously available, and while Bitcoin derivatives now allow miners to hedge their bets, hash rate derivatives improve on these and give users a miner-specific product that they can leverage.

Sam Chwarzynski, chief financial officer of Blockware Solutions and managing partner of Blockware Mining — a company providing hardware and services within the mining industry — explained that hash rate derivatives are still a new product, with two variations of it becoming popular. There are basic “cloud mining” contracts as well as “difficulty hedge” contracts that enable miners to lock in specific network difficulty rates for a certain time period, usually six to nine weeks. Chwarzynski further added:

“For a slight premium, Difficulty Hedges allow miners to hedge their cost of production similar to the way traditional commodity producers/farmers hedge their production with futures & other derivatives. As the commoditization of Bitcoin mining continues we expect the hashrate derivatives market to mature as well.”

Governments are getting involved

Bitcoin’s reputation has changed tremendously over time, and this has led governments to take either more relaxed or regulated stances toward the cryptocurrency industry. Countries like Portugal and others have cut taxes on activities such as cryptocurrency trading and mining as a means to incentive growth. Gibbs told Cointelegraph that “Aside from self-mining, many nations are actively supporting Bitcoin miners through energy subsidies and tax incentives. I think now they know it is imperative to ensure as much hashrate is within their borders as possible.”

Other governments have started to invest in Bitcoin mining themselves, with Kazakhstan having set up 13 Bitcoin mining operations in the country, and is on track to open four more. However, not all governments have a positive stance toward cryptocurrencies, and mining is still illegal in some countries.

Mason Jappa, CEO of Blockware Solutions and managing partner of Blockware Mining, told Cointelegraph that such scenarios create a lot of risk: “Many farms in China, Venezuela, and other countries face situations where the government may not support their operation. That is, farms operate illegally and if caught may have their operation shut down and miners seized.”

On the other hand, other governments have taken a less-than-conventional approach to BTC mining. While Iran legalized the practice last year, it was recently announced that newly minted Bitcoin must be sold directly to the country’s central bank. Gibbs added:

“The ability to anonymously accumulate Bitcoin through mining is an attractive value proposition for countries who aren’t able to easily transact with other nations due to sanctions, etc. My assumption is that a few nations are already mining Bitcoin for this very reason.”

More decentralization

With all of the new tools, access to new resources, and collaboration and security provided by governments on several levels, it’s likely that mining will continue to be taken over by companies with large sums of capital to invest. However, it will also become more decentralized when it comes to the geographic distribution of mining farms, according to Gibbs.

He added that Chinese miners are now diversifying some of their operations to other countries, but that would not mean that they are losing their dominant position: “As long as 100% of the Bitcoin mining ASICs originate in, or very close to China, they will continue to have an insurmountable edge on the rest of the world.”

As big plates come in with big money, mining is likely to continue to slip out of the reach of the community. What once started out as a few people using their personal computers for mining is now a gigantic industry where specific machines must be purchased along with hosting, maintenance and other expenses. For the time being, however, mining Bitcoin can still be profitable, especially as Bitcoin price continues to reach new levels.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-founder-years-prison-millions-dollars-exit-scam-without-paying-taxes/,"Crypto Founder Faces 10 Years in Prison Over Millions of Dollars in Exit Scam Without Paying Taxes

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced this week that a “cryptocurrency founder” was arrested Thursday and charged with a “multimillion-dollar tax evasion scheme.” The indictment against Amir Bruno Elmaani was unsealed Thursday in Manhattan federal court. In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) separately filed civil charges against him.

The DOJ alleges that Elmaani made millions of dollars from the sale of the cryptocurrency he founded called “Oyster Pearl” but evaded reporting his crypto income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Department of Justice described that his tax evasion scheme involves “filing a false tax return, operating his business and owning assets through pseudonyms and shell companies, obtaining income through nominees, and dealing in gold and cash.”

Elmaani operated almost exclusively online under the pseudonym Bruno Block, the DOJ described. After selling the pearl tokens in an initial coin offering (ICO) that took place in September and October 2017 and on exchanges, he announced his intention to take a “founder’s share” of the tokens for his own personal use. “Elmaani owned and controlled the subsequently established company Oyster Protocol Inc. through a shell company not associated with his true name,” the DOJ claims.

A statement issued by Bruno Block on June 7, 2018, states that he had to move the tokens to a different cryptocurrency wallet “in order to avoid being double-taxed.” However, the DOJ revealed that “In truth, Eemaani did not report or pay tax on any of his cryptocurrency proceeds,” adding:

Elmaani used friends and family as nominees to receive cryptocurrency proceeds and transfer them or U.S. currency to his own accounts.

According to the DOJ, “Elmaani dealt substantially in precious metals, kept gold bars in a safe on a yacht he owned, and used large amounts of cash to pay personal expenses.”

The exit scam began in late October 2018 when Elmaani minted new pearl tokens for his own personal use, increasing its total supply even though the number of pearl tokens was purposedly fixed. He immediately converted the new tokens to other types of cryptocurrencies, causing the token to be delisted by exchanges, sending the price of the token plummeting. The DOJ detailed:

Elmaani carried out the exit scheme only days before the exchange he had used to cash out his pearl tokens was set to require ‘know your customer’ personal identifying information from its users.

The DOJ also revealed that Elmaani falsely claimed that he only had approximately $15,000 of income from a “patent design” business in the tax return he filed in 2017. He did not file a return in 2018 but spent over $10 million on multiple yachts. He also spent $1.6 million at a carbon fiber composite company, hundreds of thousands of dollars at a home improvement store, and over $700,000 for the purchase of two homes. The DOJ concluded:

Elmaani, 28, is charged with two counts of tax evasion, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Meanwhile, the SEC announced at the same time as the DOJ that Elmaani has been charged with conducting a “self-minting scam” and an unregistered ICO. The agency described that he conducted “an illegal securities offering of digital tokens and for his scheme to profit by minting millions of unauthorized tokens for himself at no cost and selling them into the secondary market, thereby causing the value of others’ tokens to plummet.”

Four U.S. lawmakers have sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, warning of the risks of restricting the use of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets. Their concerns follow reports that the Treasury Department may be on the verge of imposing such strict cryptocurrency regulations aimed at self-hosted crypto wallets.

Crypto Regulations That Could Make Existing Self-Hosted Wallet Users Criminals

U.S. Congressmen Warren Davidson, Tom Emmer, Ted Budd, and Scott Perry sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday outlining their “concern regarding reports that the Treasury Department is considering issuing regulations that would restrict the use of self-hosted wallets.”

The lawmakers warned that if the planned regulation “requires a company to determine the owner of a self-hosted wallet, with which the company’s users wish to transact, then Americans’ utilization of digital asset transactions would be placed at a significant disadvantage to our global competitors.” They further noted that “Such a regulation could actually undermine the Treasury Department from stopping illicit actors from exploiting the financial system,” elaborating:

The contemplated regulation would not meaningfully support law enforcement, while it would raise privacy concerns and place impractical regulatory burdens on digital asset users and companies.

The letter proceeds to explain the benefits of using self-hosted wallets. “Eliminating the middleman through the use of self-hosted wallets means that consumers can maintain privacy and transact freely, which is critically important as individuals increasingly conduct their financial lives digitally,” the Congressmen wrote. In comparison, they pointed out that “Such freedom stands in stark contrast to China’s digital yuan, where citizens’ transactions are surveilled and transactions involving disfavored individuals or activities can be censored.”

Moreover, the letter points out that while “private transactions between two parties may be exploited for illicit purposes, the reality is that this same vulnerability exists with cash,” emphasizing that “multiple reports have shown that digital assets are not widely used by illicit actors.” The lawmakers then questioned:

Many people already have self-hosted wallets, as they are currently legal, lawfully used, and being rapidly adopted. A regulation, such as is being reported, could effectively make these individuals criminals. What would happen with their assets?

With respect to the anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, the letter suggests that “there should be regulatory parity between the traditional financial system and the digital asset ecosystem.”

In conclusion, the lawmakers asked the Treasury Department to “consult with Congress and industry stakeholders before taking any decisive action,” requesting that the department provides “details regarding any proposal currently under consideration and an explanation as to its rationale.”

They mint new coins that are more often than not sold on the market so they can keep their operations running. Miners help secure the network and are rewarded for doing so.

Most cryptocurrencies – including bitcoin, ether, and Litecoin – reward miners with a specific amount of coins per block found, plus the amount of collected fees included in the transactions in the block they found.

When blockchains get clogged over large transaction volumes, miners make a profit as users start competing with each other to get their transactions included in the next block. This competition sees them bid on higher fees, that go directly to the miners that find the right blocks.

Earlier this year, when the decentralized finance (DeFi) space started booming, Ethereum miners’ revenues hit a two-year high of $602,000 per day. While the figure is split amongst all of the miners on the network, it’s clear from the chart below how much more miners started earning.

Getting into cryptocurrency mining can, however, be challenging for newcomers to the space. Finding the right hardware to buy to make a profit is a challenge, and setting it up properly with the right cooling system and finding the right energy prices to keep healthy margins may be reserved for larger operations only.

To tackle these challenges cloud mining was created. Cloud mining lets users mine crypto assets using rented cloud computing power without having to buy, install, and run the hardware themselves. The service makes mining accessible to more people, but often cloud mining providers charge hidden maintenance and energy fees that cut away investors’ profits.

Enter MinerGarden, the first cloud cryptocurrency mining farm that puts accessibly and ease-of-use ahead of fees. With MinerGarden, users can contribute to the security of their favorite cryptocurrency network, while earning passive income through the firm’s affordable cloud mining contracts.

How to Mine Crypto With “Miners Garden”

MinerGarden offers users affordable cloud mining contracts, starting from 200 GH/s. This means users can start mining with a very low initial investment and take their time to decide whether the service is the right one for them.

The firm keeps prices low by using the proper equipment and hiring experts to configure it properly. Mining using favorable energy prices also helps it keep down cryptocurrency cloud mining contract costs. MinerGarden’s data centers host hundreds of miners and the farm charges no maintenance fees.

To start mining cryptocurrency with MinerGarden you just need to follow three simple steps:

The French council of ministers has approved a series of new measures to combat the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions. Anonymous accounts are banned at crypto exchanges which must now impose stricter know-your-customer requirements. France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says the changes are necessary to fight against terrorism financing.

France Tightens Crypto Surveillance

France’s Council of Ministers endorsed an ordinance containing a series of measures to tighten the surveillance of cryptocurrency activities last week. The ordinance, which will enter into force in six months, was submitted by the French Minister of Finance, Bruno Le Maire, along with ministers Sébastien Lecornu and Olivier Dussopt.

La Maire tweeted Wednesday: “We must dry up all the terrorist financing circuits for the smallest euro … we presented to the Council of Ministers this morning an order making it possible to strengthen the fight against the anonymity of crypto-asset transactions.” According to the press release issued by the three ministers:

This ordinance strengthens the fight against the anonymity of transactions in digital assets by including digital asset service providers … among the entities having the ban on keeping anonymous accounts.

The ordinance’s measures will be specified in the upcoming decrees to be released this week, according to local media. All French cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to equip themselves with a more rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) system.

Crypto exchanges will have to request two proofs of identity from their customers from the first euro spent, instead of the previous 1,000 euro minimum limit. The ID requirements will be a SEPA transfer accompanied by an identity document. In addition, all exchanges, including those that do not offer fiat trading pairs, will need to register with an administrative body, likely the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), France’s financial markets regulator.

However, the new requirements raise concerns that non-European customers will be unable to register on French cryptocurrency exchanges because they do not have a European bank account, thus depriving French startups of participating in the global crypto market.

“We are aware that this reinforced identification penalizes companies,” a ministerial source was quoted by the Capital publication as saying. She added that “The decree will therefore come into force in the spring” so companies have several months to comply.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed an order compelling the country’s government workers to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings. The order stipulates that employees must submit details of where they bought the digital assets and the value thereof by June 30, 2021.

Similarly, children and spouses of government employees must disclose their digital asset holdings, according to a document that was signed on Nov. 10. Meanwhile, as part of the new requirements that are also applicable to citizens applying for public office, Russian government workers are required to state:

The name of the digital financial asset indicated (if it cannot be determined, the type and scope of rights certified by the issuer of the digital financial asset are indicated). Additionally, workers can also report digital rights, including both digital financial assets and other digital rights.

Additionally, the order directs workers to furnish the government with details of the investment platforms they use. Meanwhile, in addition to the requirement to specify the “unique convention that identifies the utility digital right,” the decree asks workers to “Indicate the name of the operator of the investment platform, its identification. (The) taxpayer number and main state registration number.”

Before signing the latest order, the Russian president signed into law a bill giving legal status to cryptocurrencies in late July. Still, that measure prohibits the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment.

Consequently, the new order, along with revised proposals sent to parliament (Duma) by the country’s Ministry of Finance in late November, appears to be the continuation of that stance. In fact, the latest measures and efforts by the Russian government reiterate to its workers the liabilities that arise from possessing digital currencies.

Vitalik Buterin Warns about Security of Cryptocurrency Wallets

Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian programmer and Co-founder of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, asked the crypto community to talk more about security. He said that user-friendly wallets are needed because current wallets are insecure for non-technical users.

During a conversation at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference, Buterin mentioned that the cryptocurrency market did not give much importance to the security side and that is why it is much easier to lose a large amount in digital assets if a cryptocurrency wallet breaks.

The sheer scale of the scam has made it difficult for Google to block them, and for Australian regulators to take action.

The fake celebrity ads have run on news websites since at least 2018, but with people stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, many more have been caught out by the scams.

In the most common form of the scam, the unwitting user who clicks on an ad is taken to a fake news story that includes a link purporting to be a cryptocurrency investment scheme. If they enter their details to register for the scheme, they receive a phone call typically asking them to invest a small sum, such as US$250, and then increasingly large amounts.

IDCare, a registered charity that offers support to people scammed online, has been hearing from a victim every business hour since March, its managing director told Guardian Australia.

“This is becoming increasingly common. For some of these people they have lost their entire life savings,” Prof David Lacey said.

‘How could it hurt?’

Janice*, a 77-year-old grandmother from Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, saw an ad on Facebook earlier this year featuring Forrest promoting a bitcoin investment scheme. She clicked through to find out more and was presented with a story on a fake news site that also referred to The Project host Waleed Aly.

After entering her details, she received a call from a man with an English accent who encouraged her to invest in the scheme, so she transferred $5,000 via her bank to Jubiter, a cryptocurrency exchange.

Janice eventually handed over $80,000 to the scammers, her entire life savings, before her daughter told her it was a scam. Despite contacting her bank, the police and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Scamwatch website, she was unable to get the money back.

Scam celebrity endorsements are a “common deceptive technique”, Lacey says.

“In Germany, Boris Becker is promoting cryptocurrency fraud investments. He, of course, doesn’t, but the crooks know his celebrity attracts and assists with the deception. For an initial US$250 investment, people think, ‘Why not? How could it hurt? It’s not a lot of money.’”

Lacey says the initial investment is a ploy to bait people.

“In fact the real value for the scammers is not the initial US$250, but the harvesting of contact details from someone they know is primed and ready to explore the cryptocurrency investment world.”

How does the scam work?

Guardian Australia began the process of signing up for the scam to determine how people were duped into paying.

Fake news website used for the scam ads. Photograph: Screenshot

The site I signed up to purported to be a bitcoin trading service called bitcoin-Up, but I was ultimately directed to another site called Gtlot, which purports to be a cryptocurrency trading platform. It operates from St Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean, which does not regulate foreign exchange trading platforms.

About five minutes after signing up for the service, I received a call from the Netherlands. The man on the line attempted to walk me through the process of signing up, claiming that from an initial investment of US$250 I could make between $500 and $3,000 a month.

He claimed governments were looking to phase out paper money because of Covid-19, so now was the right time to get on board.

When I told him I was a reporter, he denied any links to scam ads, and still attempted to get me to put in my credit card details and invest money.

At best, these services encourage people to invest in highly risky, often unregulated forex trading platforms where they are likely to lose most, if not all, of their money, with little recourse to get their money back.

At worst they are scams, designed to encourage people to hand over more and more money in an attempt to get their initial investment back.

An international investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported that contact details of people who signed up for such services were also passed on to brokers offering other risky or illegitimate investments.

How do the ads evade detection?

Google says it removed 5,000 bad ads per minute in 2019 – 2.7bn in total – but “scammers are constantly evolving their efforts, while we evolve our policies and enforcement to address this”.

The scammers buy millions of ads in Google’s ad market places, using the names of local celebrities in each country, without their knowledge or endorsement. Dick Smith, Chris Hemsworth, David Koch and Waleed Aly are among those whose profiles have been used in Australia.

The scammers have increasingly sought to get past Google’s detection by making repeated minor changes to the text of the ads in what Google calls a “cat and mouse” game.

Media outlets and other websites that take Google’s ads cannot easily control whether the scam ads appear on their website.

Guardian Australia managed to prevent the ads appearing on its site by blocking a specific marketplace where the ads were being sold. A typical marketplace has tens of thousands of ads – this one had millions.

The scammers purchase hundreds of domain names every month, using a variety of domain registration companies, to host the pages that users are directed to when they click on the ads. The URLs are a jumble of letters, typically only around 10 characters long.

The source code of one of these sites reveals that from Australia it looks like the fake news sites promoting the scam investment, but viewed from outside the target region, it appears to be a website discussing mandarins.

A screenshot of a fake scam website viewed from outside Australia. Photograph: Screenshot

Australian cybersecurity expert Gabor Szathmari found similar dummy websites about plants, swimming and gardening appeared when visited from outside Australia.

When a person is visiting from a targeted location, the site pulls up the fake news website from another domain, meaning it is very easy for the scammers to run the same fake story across multiple sites at once.

When one gets blocked, many more are waiting to be used. The websites do not stay active for long. Some sites Guardian Australia found in late November had ceased working less than two weeks later.

Who is behind the scam?

Websites are often registered to third party companies to hide their true owners.

However, Guardian Australia found five names of people who had registered hundreds of the sites, all with addresses in the centre of Moscow,.

None of those listed on the registration forms responded to a request for comment. Two of the email addresses linked to the account were Gmail accounts. A spokesman for Google said the information would be provided to the company’s security team for investigation.

Other information suggests the operation may have links to Ukraine. Szathmari points out that the sites’ registration form prevents people from registering a Ukrainian phone number. A previous OCCRP investigation found a call centre running similar celebrity-based investment scams operating from the Ukraine capital, Kiev.

What are Australian regulators doing?

Google and Facebook have admitted they are struggling to prevent the ads appearing through their services, and Australian regulators have suggested there is little action they can take.

An spokeswoman for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission told Guardian Australia it was difficult to trace scammers based overseas.

“In some cases, we’ve been able to trace these ads, the majority of which seem to be based overseas, despite creating the impression that they’re operating from Australia by using local addresses and phone numbers on their websites. Any data we have gathered we don’t make this public.”

In the UK, the National Cyber Security Centre has blocked or taken down more than 300,000 websites associated with the scams. Asic has the power to do the same in Australia, but has indicated that it would be impractical due to the large number of websites involved and the overseas hosting.

The ACCC has had some limited success in tackling the sites. Guardian Australia understands at least four have been removed after requests were sent to the web hosts or domain registration service providers, but the ACCC lacks the resources to make greater inroads.

An ACCC spokesman also said it would consider whether the digital platforms were taking enough action to stop scams as part of its current review of ad tech.

“The Ad Tech Inquiry’s scope includes considering the extent to which ad tech services may facilitate, or fail to adequately protect against, the digital distribution of scam ads,” the spokesman said.

Bitcoin Activity

According to a report by Unchained Capital, a bitcoin-focused financial services company, Bitcoin holders moved nearly 185,000 dormant BTC during the latest November price rally, which means nearly $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin moved out of long-term storage amid a 40% price jump. Unchained capital reported that bitcoin activity has increased in recent months due to a jump in price. The $620 million transfer marks another major transaction from a relatively quiet Bitcoin account, which shows that BTC holders are planning to take advantage of the price jump.

Bitcoin has struggled to breach the important $20,000 psychological price level despite institutional adoption and a flurry of positive news. The crypto trading community is expecting increased volatility in prices due to recent activities. December has always been a volatile year for digital assets. Furthermore, Bitcoin reached the last high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017 amid the ICO boom.

This marks the Square offshoot’s 20th grant in support of Bitcoin development since it launched in the summer of 2019.

Portuguese software designer Patrícia Estevão is Square Crypto’s most recent grant recipient. Per her grant proposal, the UX Designer will use the funding to research Bitcoin user experience, specifically why people use Bitcoin and what hurdles may obstruct their use.

“I’m thrilled that I’ll finally be able to work on in-depth Bitcoin user research and I’m even more excited that it will have the clear purpose of shaping future design decisions within the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Estevão told CoinDesk.

“I’m thankful to Square Crypto and its team for granting me this opportunity. “

Estevão has been working on Bitcoin-related design since 2016. One of her more recent and impactful projects is an in-depth paper she published for Lightning Network design in November 2019.

Once concluded, her research will find its way into the Bitcoin Design Guide, an open-source, community project that includes UX/UI design notes for developers, businesses or anyone building on Bitcoin.

Square Crypto and Bitcoin development

The grant is the latest in a deluge of funding that Square Crypto, the Bitcoin-focused arm of Jack Dorsey’s Square, has poured into Bitcoin development over the past year. In addition to funding Bitcoin Core developers including Jon Atack and Lloyd Fournier, Square Crypto has also funded open-source software such as BTCPay Server and Chris Belcher’s CoinSwap design.

More than $67 million of shares traded in the first three days, making it the highest volume debut of a publicly-traded crypto fund in U.S. history.

The prior record holder, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ticker: ETHE), saw just over $9M in trading volume during the first three days following its debut on OTCQX on June 25, 2019. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker: GBTC), the largest crypto fund, with more than $10 billion in assets under management today, joined OTCQX on May 5, 2015, and had under $1 million in trading volume in its first three days on the market.

“We are thrilled to see the market’s reception of BITW as the first publicly traded crypto index fund,” said Bitwise cofounder and CEO Hunter Horsley. “As more and more financial advisors and investment professionals look to establish an allocation to crypto in their portfolios, a professionally managed index fund is a familiar and important tool.”

BITW ended last week as the fourth most highly traded security on OTCQX Friday, behind GBTC, Roche Pharmaceuticals (ticker: RHHBY) and Air Canada (ticker: ACDVF).

“We are pleased that a market developed so quickly in BITW last week, with multiple market makers and a wide variety of participants involved,” said Bitwise COO Teddy Fusaro. “All investors should carefully consider the risks associated with the Fund, including the fact that we anticipate BITW shares will trade at either significant premiums to or significant discounts to their underlying value. We encourage individuals to talk to their financial advisor prior to making any investment decision.”

The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund had over $135 million in assets under management as of December 13, 2020. The fund tracks an index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, screened for certain risks and weighted by market capitalization. The index and the fund are rebalanced on a monthly basis. As of Nov. 30, 2020, the fund held approximately 75% Bitcoin and 13% Ethereum, with the remaining 12% allocated across XRP, Litecoin, Chainlink, Tezos, and other cryptocurrencies.

But what about everyday Americans? Will people ever use cryptocurrencies as a primary method of paying for goods and services, or as a store of value?

In this Nov. 30 Fool Live video, two of our financial sector experts weigh in. Hear what Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel, CFP, and Jason Moser, host of Industry Focus: Financials, have to say about what's standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

Jason Moser: But it also feels like there are challenges for crypto, at least in the near term. You mentioned it in regard to mainstream adoption. Now, maybe that clears up, maybe as time passes, maybe that adoption as a medium of exchange, maybe that becomes a little bit more commonplace. I don't see a big reason today why I need to go to the store and pay for something with bitcoin. I mean, it just doesn't seem like there's any real advantage, but I mean, given what we know today, given the small steps these companies are taking, it feels like maybe that mainstream adoption right now doesn't even matter.

Matt Frankel: Well, as far as mainstream adoption as a currency, there's two use cases. There's adoption as a currency and as historic value. As a currency, I see three main obstacles to really mainstream adoption of bitcoin. One, it's very volatile. You don't want to buy a type of currency that could be worse twice or half as much in a week. If you don't think bitcoin could do that, look at some of the charts from the past few years, bitcoin going up or down by a few thousand dollars in a week. So that's another thing, the volatility scares people away. Number two, there are too many cryptocurrencies and it's easy to make a new one. When I was checking just before we were on the show, there are over 4,100 active cryptocurrencies right now. Most of them aren't big, but there are a lot of big ones. There's over 10 that have a billion-dollar market cap or higher. There is a lot of cryptocurrencies out there, and it's pretty easy to, for institutions if they want to, to make their own. The idea of bitcoin at first was one central currency. But if there's 4,000 of them floating around, it defeats the purpose. Number three, as you mentioned, there are some really easy ways to pay with U.S. dollars right now.

Moser: Sure.

Frankel: With a lot of these fintech innovations, I tap my wallet on a card reader at some places now and I could make a payment. U.S. dollars aren't that tough to use anymore.

Moser: No.

Frankel: In my mind, for bitcoin to get mainstream acceptance, it needs to do something that you can't do with dollars. Which I get that there is a lot of use case for international money transfer and stuff like that, but between volatility and the fact that there's literally thousands of them, and innovations in dollar-based fintech, I really can't make the mainstream use case myself, but apparently a lot of people disagree because there's $359 billion worth of bitcoin out there right now and it's now over $19,000 a piece, so apparently if some people agree and they are buying.

Moser: Well, yeah, it could be argued certainly that there's a lot of speculation in that market. I'd be willing to bet that a lot of people that are speculating on the market don't really understand exactly how it works. I can't sit there and say that I fully understand how it all works. My basic understanding is though that there there's a fixed amount. There's a fixed amount of Bitcoin. If you have something that is limited in supply, that obviously will make a difference in something like dollars, for example, as we've seen, not limited in supply.

Frankel: That's the big argument for bitcoin being a store of value is that it's essentially inflation proof in that sense. U.S. dollars, the government can always print more of them, which they do pretty regularly, and with bitcoin, that's not the case. There is a finite amount. As a store of value, it could make sense. But if that's the big use case, then who cares if you can use PayPal's merchants if it's just the store of value? Bitcoin might decide which way it's going to go, and I guess I can't make a use case for owning bitcoin as a store of value over gold right now, and I can't make a case of using it as a payment over U.S. dollars.",2020-12-14 00:00:00,https://www.fintechmagazine.com/financial-services-finserv/bbva-launches-bitcoin-trading-and-custody,"Spain’s second biggest bank will launch its cryptocurrency trading and custody service in January 2021.

BBVA’s Swiss division will handle the rollout, which initially will be dedicated to Bitcoin before exploring other virtual currencies. The bank says it has spent more than five years researching blockchain and its various applications, believing now is the ‘right moment’ to launch into the burgeoning market in response to rocketing demand.

BBVA customers will be able to buy, sell, hold and trade Bitcoin with ‘all the guarantees of any other banking service’.

The service will launch in Switzerland ‘due to the fact that it is the most advanced European country in terms of regulation and adoption of digital assets,” the bank said in a press release. It also highlighted the ‘wide array’ of blockchain companies in Switzerland, making it a strong crucible for wider adoption in Europe.

“Digital assets have enormous potential to transform the way value and information are exchanged through blockchain technology,” said Alicia Pertusa, Head of Client Solutions Strategy at BBVA. “Financial institutions, in collaboration with supervisors, can play a relevant role in the integration of digital assets in current markets and infrastructures.”

Are banks ready for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin and other major altcoins have returned to the fore as potential solutions to the myriad issues thrown up by the COVID-19 pandemic, including international payments. Cryptocurrencies are attracting vast new stores of personal wealth and institutional capital. Bitcoin rose to a new record value earlier this month at $19,920.53, the first new trading peak since 2017.

In the UK, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey confirmed the bank is exploring launching its own virtual currency. “We are looking at the question of, should we create a Bank of England digital currency,” he said, adding that such a move would have “huge implicaitons” on payments and society.

Across the pond, digital currencies are also gaining favour in the mainstream. “Even the highest echelons of US financial system seem to be considering how crypto may fit into the post-Covid reality,” Dacxi MD Katharine Wooler wrote in a recent column for FinTech Magazine, as officials explore avenues to future proof the USD in an increasingly global, digital financial system.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/12/170265-uk-spain-fintech-nebeus-launches-cryptocurrency-rental-service-crypto-renting/,"UK/Spain-based fintech Nebeus announced on Monday the launch of its new product, Crypto Renting. Nebeus describes Crypto Renting as a unique product in the fintech and crypto industries that allows cryptocurrency owners to get passive earnings from their crypto without selling it.

“Crypto Renting, from Nebeus, works like any other rental service: any Nebeus’ user who owns Crypto can rent their Bitcoin and Ethereum to Nebeus, who will pay a monthly rent, or even a daily one, for its use. Nebeus users who decide to rent their Crypto in a Crypto Renting program will receive a monthly rent payout for their Crypto, similar to property owners who receive rent from their tenants. Nebeus users will also be able to select the option to withdraw their earnings once every 24 hours. All rent payouts made by Nebeus are in euro currency.”

While sharing more details about the product, Sergey Romonovskiy, CEO of Nebeus, stated:

“Crypto Renting is yet another step in our mission to bridge Crypto and cash. We launched this product to give people who own cryptocurrencies a service that allows them to profit from Crypto in a different way. With so many people investing large sums of money into Crypto, it makes sense for people to be able to use that investment to gain profit without having to sell their investments. Crypto Renting will allow our users to gain a stable passive income from their Crypto.”

As previously reported, Nebeus, which began trading in 2017, reported it has captured a 50% quarterly year-to-date increase in sales of its financial services, including its crypto-fiat payment card, P2P Bitcoin loans, and the crypto exchange.

“As such, Nebeus is now riding the surge in sales to raise funds in order to widen its portfolio of crypto-to-fiat services and provide holders of cryptocurrency with additional means of cashing out into fiat currency, be it through debit cards, loans, or even regular bank accounts.”

The company is currently raising funds through its second equity crowdfunding campaign on Seedrs. Originally seeking £400,000, Nebeus’ latest fundraising effort has secured nearly £850,000. The funding round is set to close next week.",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/paypal-stock-hits-new-high-as-e-commerce-bitcoin-trading-rally-continues/,"E-commerce firm PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is the IBD Stock of the Day on hitting an all-time high after a recent breakout from a cup base. PayPal stock has advanced since it joined rival Square (SQ) in allowing customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

PayPal stock hit an all-time high of 223.16 in intraday trading on Monday before pulling back a bit to close at 220.79, up 3.1%. With Monday's gain, PayPal stock moved back above a cup-base buy point of 215.93.

However, investors should consider a 220.67 entry point as more appropriate. PayPal stock began consolidating after hitting a new high on Dec. 1.

PayPal stock bulls expect online penetration of total retail spending to continue growing this holiday shopping season during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shares in PayPal fell when it reported third-quarter earnings in October and it opted not to provide preliminary 2021 guidance.

PayPal Stock Rallies On Cryptocurrency Trading Service

However, PayPal stock rallied on the launch of its cryptocurrency trading service in late November.

In addition, PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 28 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said.

At Deutsche Bank, analyst Bryan Keane expects upside.

""A recent PYPL survey revealed 54% of PYPL users have interest in its crypto offerings and we believe there has been strong interest in demand thus far,"" said Keane in a recent report.

He added: ""Even more powerful is the frequency of visits to the PYPL commerce portal from crypto users, which will lead to higher customer engagement and more monetizable transactions.""

PayPal stock belongs to the IBD Leaderboard as well as the Long-Term Leaders List. The Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.

Since its spinoff from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments services provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.

The PayPal checkout technology has over 361 million users. The e-commerce firm also has 28 million merchants on its payment network.

TPV Growth A Key Financial Metric

Aside from earnings and revenue growth, the key financial metric for PayPal stock is total payment volume. In the September quarter, TPV rose 38% to $247 billion amid the coronavirus lockdowns. Analysts had projected TPV of $232.2 billion.

For the December quarter, PayPal forecast TPV growth in the low- to mid-30% range. PayPal reports fourth-quarter earnings in late January.

PayPal now garners less than 10% of TPV from former parent eBay. Online marketplace eBay is shifting its payment processing to Netherlands-based Adyen.

EBay has said it expects ""a majority of its Marketplace customers"" to shift to Adyen by July 2021.

PayPal has offset the loss of eBay's TPV in part from Venmo, a money-transfer service for family and friends.

PayPal Stock: Venmo Digital Wallet Redesign

Venmo, with 65 million users as of Sept. 30, is expected to generate $900 million in revenue in 2021 and reach profitability in 2022, according to PayPal.

Venmo currently garners most of its revenue from its ""Instant Deposit"" feature. It collects a small fee when users transfer funds into a debit card or bank account. A redesigned digital wallet due out in mid-2021 is expected to add new revenue streams.

Venmo's rivalry with the Square Cash App has heated up.

In 2018, Square enabled Cash App users to buy and sell Bitcoins.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

A few days ago newly elected US senator, Cynthia Lummis, endorsed Bitcoin on live television. She spoke very highly of the cryptocurrency, even revealing she had a sizable investment herself. Jack Dorsey, the well-known founder of Twitter and CEO of Square, believes in Bitcoin enough to have invested 1% of his company's value into the cryptocurrency while changing his Twitter bio to a single word: Bitcoin.

The question I hear most often these days: “If senators and tech billionaires are talking about it, should I still get into cryptocurrency, or are all the big gains gone?”.

You are not too late. Bitcoin’s entire market capitalization still only stands at around $300 billion. That number might seem high but compared to gold, which has been the de facto anti-inflation store of value of the global economy, it really isn’t. Gold’s global market cap is around $8 trillion and considering JP Morgan recently affirmed that Bitcoin has “considerable upsides” compared to gold. As a result, we have not seen the end of Bitcoin’s meteoric rise.

If you want to get into crypto’s next big thing before it truly goes mainstream, I would recommend something that has not made a lot of noise in the general public but is considered by many in the cryptosphere as the biggest thing since Bitcoin itself: Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

Related: What Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Square's $50 Million Bitcoin Investment

What is decentralized finance?

Bitcoin (and Ethereum shortly thereafter) is the original decentralized finance because nobody controls its issuance. There is no one organization responsible for deciding who holds what. No one is in charge because everyone is in charge. There is a publicly available ledger held on a multitude of nodes and computers on a global network which makes it impossible for any central authority to move Bitcoins. Additionally, there is a limited number of Bitcoins to mine. No one will ever be able to add more of the celebrated cryptocurrency to this total, as the Federal reserve is doing right now with the US dollar.

However, most Bitcoins are bought and sold on exchanges, and these exchanges are often privately owned. For the general public it’s simply a lot easier to log onto a website, such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken, and let them hold your cryptocurrency. PayPal recently announced they would allow their users to buy and sell cryptocurrency on their app which will bring in their 314 million customers to this exciting market. These companies will hold the keys to their customers Bitcoins for them.

There is a very well-known saying in the cryptosphere: “Not your keys, not your Bitcoins”. This is cautionary advice from an industry which has been burned many times. If there is one thing that discouraged investors from this asset class, it is certainly the risk of fraud. And we’re not out of the woods yet: BitMEX, a leading Bitcoin exchange, is facing criminal charges in the US while hackers stole around $150 million on KuCoin, a leading Asian exchange.

Decentralized finance is the next logical step in this adventure. It aims to build financial instruments based on smart contracts which automate transactions without any interference from central authorities. These smart contracts can be both simple and complex. Different decentralized apps, which offer services such as lending and borrowing money, bet on events without using exploitative websites or participate in a no-loss lottery.

The potential for this is incredible. Imagine buying a house using a smart contract which states that if you send a certain amount of money every month, and after a certain amount of time, the title of the house becomes yours. No need to borrow from the bank, no need for notaries or lawyers, and if you default on your payments? The title returns to the seller.

Decentralized exchanges

Decentralized exchanges is at the heart of all this because, as we have said before, if you do not hold the keys to your cryptocurrency directly? Then you’re not actually owning them. The technical side of it isn’t the main reason why DeFi might be the future of finance, but rather a shift in the world economy. There are two very important factors currently coinciding: The drastic fall of interest rates amidst the global economic crisis and, according to the World Bank, there are still 1.7 billion adults who do not have a bank account. Indeed, they are much more likely to have access to the internet, often through a mobile phone, than to own an ATM card.

Today, the biggest exchange in DeFi is Uniswap. In essence, it is a combination of software based on the Ethereum blockchain. On Uniswap, people can exchange cryptocurrency using smart contracts. Users don’t even have to keep their funds on the exchange, they just allow a pair of participants to use their smart contracts from the safety of their privately-owned keys and wallets.

The problem that DeFi has caused is the extreme use of the Ethereum network, which in turn has led to higher fees for exchanges. The popularity of Ethereum to build these smart contracts has exerted the network’s resources and led to higher prices for transactions. Now, new exchanges are finding creative solutions that don’t rely on Ethereum.

Related: Investment Opportunity With New Cryptocurrency Miners

Polkaswap is an about-to-be-launched, open-source decentralized exchange that will place your cryptocurrency in the best fund possible to earn interest on your investment. The exchange will rely on its own network, (Polkadot), which is designed to avoid the high transaction fees that have become problematic for Ethereum-based exchanges.

For the developing world decentralized exchanges will be nothing less than a game changer, especially for those that have been left behind by the traditional system. But the rest of us will still find available interest rates extremely appealing in a global market where many countries are now considering negative interest rates on their government bonds.

Inevitably, and especially in times of crisis, crypto has attracted a lot of interest due to both its merits and the failings of a traditional centralized financial system. DeFi is still in its infancy and shows the potential to be an important part of the future global economy.

The partnership provides Cboe with exclusive rights over the CoinRoutes RealPrice Best-Bid-Offer (BBO), which offers real-time crypto price data aggregated across several trading venues. Cboe plans to use the data to launch indexes tied to the digital asset market at the beginning of 2021, according to Catherine Clay, its senior vice president and head of information solutions.

Cboe would be the latest firm to announce interest in launching crypto data products. S&P Global recently announced a deal with crypto data services provider Lukka on its own indexes, which are set to launch next year.

Indeed, the entrance of traditional financial services firms could help mature digital asset market data, which is known for its fragmentation and dislocations. Clay said CoinRoutes data is unique in the market given it is used to execute trades at what could be argued is the best possible price.

""It is a hard-to-replicate data set,"" she said. ""It is an executive data point versus a theoretical data point — exactly the type of transparent and action data that informs trading decisions in different asset classes.""

As for the roadmap, Clay said that the data would initially be used by clients to aid in portfolio development and other pre-trade processes. In the future, Cboe could see those indexes utilized for various types of trading or structured products.

""I do see this as a very large revenue opportunity for us, but equally as important it helps bring more participants into the digital asset ecosystem,"" she said. ""That raises the level of legitimacy and comfort in this space.""

To be sure, this wouldn't be Cboe's first attempt at taking a crack at crypto. Cboe stopped listing bitcoin futures in March 2019 after it failed to compete head-to-head with crosstown rival CME Group. Attempts to launch several bitcoin exchange-traded products were stymied by opposition within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cboe's partnership with CoinRoutes could possibly open the door to such a product in the future, according to CoinRoutes CEO Dave Weisberger.

He said the data address a number of concerns previously outlined by the agency, including a level of transparency that ""wouldn't be unparalleled and should be a game-changer for regulators.""

""First, RealPrice is much less susceptible to manipulation than Bitcoin indexes. That is due to the fact that weighting is not arbitrary, but rather based on the actual executable order book,"" Weisberger said. Previous ETF proposals were based on indexes that were not usable for execution purposes.

""Second, with access to all of our cross-market data, Cboe would be able to flag strange divergences in price across markets,"" he continued, referring to the SEC's concerns about market manipulation that could impact trading in a product available to retail clients.

Still, it wouldn't address several other issues regulators have expressed about a bitcoin ETF, including custody concerns and exchange breaches.",,https://www.coindesk.com/grayscale-now-has-13b-in-crypto-assets-under-management,"Disclosure

Italian motorcycle manufacturer Soriano Motori has become the first motorcycle manufacturer to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method worldwide. This is a major milestone in blockchain adoption in the automobile industry within the European scene.

Four Cryptocurrencies Supported

The Italian motorcycle brand revealed it would accept a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Customers will be able to make purchases with the supported currencies regardless of their country of origin.

The motorcycle giant revealed that its three new electric models can now be purchased using cryptocurrencies. The brands include V1-R, VI-S and V1-Gara at starting prices of € 25,500, € 30,500, and € 32,500, respectively.

Soriano Motori eCommerce store is integrated with Coinbase cryptocurrency trading platform and uses an advanced blockchain system to guarantee the security of transactions.

With this development, Soriano continues to lead the motorcycle sector with its commitment towards accepting cryptocurrencies. The automobile firm believes that Bitcoin represents the future of transactions and does not want to miss out on the current crypto hype train.

Speaking about the development, founder of Soriano Motori, M. Soriano believes that potential customers can benefit from the ease of blockchain payments.

“All our clients will be able to benefit from the great advantages that cryptocurrencies offer. Thanks to digital currencies such as Bitcoin, we can carry out international transactions without commissions or without attending to exchange rate fluctuations, among others,” he said.

Blockchain Technology and the Automobile Industry

The automobile industry is one that has been largely receptive to blockchain technology. This is due to the potentials that blockchain solutions offer to supply management and the prospect of improving existing automobile apps.

Earlier in September, Ontology revealed a partnership with Daimler Mobility to develop a blockchain based-mobility platform. The platform called MoveX would include user roaming, sharing, and bundling of data and information.

Automobile giant Renault has also been leveraging blockchain technology and recently tested its blockchain project Xceed. The blockchain platform was developed in conjunction with Hyperledger and IBM. The blockchain solution has the capacity to archive more than a million documents.

Nevertheless, there has been little push towards integrating cryptocurrencies by these major automobile firms.

Financial terms were not disclosed.

Founded in 2015, B2C2 is one of the best-known cryptocurrency trading companies. It helps brokerages, exchanges and fund managers make large trades in virtual coins.

SBI has been allowing its clients to trade through B2C2’s platform since July, when it acquired a minority stake in the crypto firm.

The companies hope the acquisition will create the counterparty of choice for mainstream financial firms looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, they said.

“Their (B2C2’s) vision, expertise and offering complement SBI’s, and we look forward to working in partnership as we expand our footprint across the global markets,” said Yoshitaka Kitao, president and CEO of SBI Holdings.

The deal, which marks the latest move by a large financial institution in crypto, could help make the nascent asset class more mainstream.

It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, backed by growing demand from investors who see the virtual currency as a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.

While cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade they have been attracting established financial companies over the last few years.

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced earlier this month that it would launch cryptocurrency indexes in 2021, while Fidelity Investments and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc have started safeguarding virtual coins for institutional investors.

Such services are helping make the asset class more accessible for institutions.

“A lot of people have been dismissive for a long time,” Max Boonen, B2C2’s founder, said in an interview. “Bitcoin’s price at an all-time high has put concerns to rest.”

eToroX is eToro’s professional crypto exchange. Conceived and produced for the corporate and institutional-grade crypto trading community, the eToroX exchange is a highly effective, trusted and secure crypto trading solution.

eToro is the rapidly growing global $2.5bn unicorn that offers digital asset management services for more than 15 million users, who can trade on stocks, commodities, forex, and cryptocurrency markets.

Fueled by the recent surge in interest from institutional and retail investors in Bitcoin, which reached new price records since its last 2017 all-time high, the rapidly maturing cryptocurrency markets are expected to easily surpass the $1 trillion dollar global capitalization and continue to develop following a rapid adoption trajectory.

This has prompted eToro to capitalize on the emerging market opportunity and expand its cryptocurrency portfolio after a 12-month hiatus.

Elrond is a public blockchain that has delivered the first truly scalable sharding architecture solution, which is able to deliver more than 15,000 transactions per second and can scale even further, having achieved 263,000 transactions per second in public tests.

Compared to the 7 transactions per second of Bitcoin and 14 transactions per second of Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies at this time, Elrond is akin to what broadband internet was to the early days of slow internet connections.

Recently, Elrond also announced the launch of its digital wallet and global payments app dubbed Maiar, scheduled for Jan. 31.

Through Maiar, Elrond is positioned for an accelerated growth period, aiming to gain widespread mainstream adoption because in addition to crypto, the app aims to gradually provide the same features as PayPal, Venmo, and Google Pay but without collecting any personal information and at much lower fixed fees.

Beniamin Mincu, CEO & Founder of Elrond Network said: “In its 10 years of existence Bitcoin has proven that cryptocurrencies are secure and can serve an important purpose in the internet economy. Elrond opens up a new frontier offering internet-scale blockchain performance, and an intuitive application called Maiar, through which we aim to bring the next billion people to the blockchain space.”

Elrond’s eGold cryptocurrency will debut in the eToro ecosystem on Wednesday the 23rd of December, when it will become available on the eToroX cryptocurrency exchange.

About Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

Bitcoin trades on different exchanges, which creates confusion as to whether this is the first or second time it has reached $20,000. But while crypto enthusiasts may differ on the all-time high, they agree that the digital token's record run shows bitcoin has legitimacy.

“The fundamentals are the same as in 2017, but the opportunities for making bitcoin more expressive are far greater than the last big bull run that got it to $20,000,” said Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis, a crypto venture builder that focuses on products that “bring utility” to bitcoin, such as Fold, a Visa credit card that lets holders earn rewards in bitcoin.

The last time bitcoin mania was at its peak was in December 2017 when the cryptocurrency hit $20,000. In the following months, bitcoin had wild swings, with the value dropping as low as $5,500. Janet Yellen, who was chair of the Federal Reserve at the time and who is now President-elect Joe Biden's pick for treasury secretary — warned then that the cryptocurrency was a “highly speculative asset” and not a “stable store of value.”

This time, experts say a better market understanding of bitcoin, more mainstream adoption and a desire to use cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge make this bull run different than the 2017 bubble.

“The bitcoin narrative about scarce digital gold is growing, especially with the uncertainty around the stimulus environment,” said Rob Paone, who runs the YouTube channel “Crypto Bobby” and is the founder of Proof of Talent, a blockchain recruiting firm.

“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming a must-have for some of the traditional players,” Paone said. “Square has been successful adding it [to its app] and other companies have taken note and added it to their platform, most notably PayPal and Robinhood. It’s table stakes — and a lot of companies are looking at this like they are missing out if they are not adding it to their portfolio of products.”

""Bitcoin is now table stakes: Companies are looking at this like they are missing out if they are not adding it to their portfolio.""

While mainstream financial platforms helped popularize some volume of retail trading, Luongo said the market is also seeing “significant, high-conviction plays from large funds and even CEOs of publicly traded companies,” which make this 2020 run different than the last.

“Names like Guggenheim Partners, Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, and the recent support from Michael Saylor at Microstrategies and Jack Dorsey at Square and Twitter are telling,” he said.

S&P Dow Jones also announced this month that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, paving the way for cryptocurrencies to become more mainstream investments.

Beyond the swing of high-profile supporters, there isn’t a way to tell who is buying bitcoin. However, the number of new bitcoin addresses, the unique identifiers where the assets are sent, recently hit a record of 25,000 per hour for the first time since January 2018, according to data intelligence firm Glassnode.

Both experts said one major factor driving the bull run is the uncertainty around the current economy and a lack of stimulus.

“In 2017, we saw a bitcoin bubble. In 2021, I expect we will see another. But, unlike the last, the alternative financial system has grown tremendously. We’re beginning to see real, parallel economic activity outside of trading, commerce and credit facilities,” Luongo said. “This growth represents real adoption, and it won’t disappear when the next bubble bursts.”",2020-12-16 13:54:58+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/16/bitcoin-blasts-above-20000-pulling-these-cryptocur/,"What happened

The price of bitcoin blasted past $20,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday, and it has continued climbing. As of 12:30 p.m. EST, bitcoin was around $20,600.

Bitcoin's 7% move was reflected in surges for other cryptocurrencies. For example, Ether (the native token for the Ethereum blockchain) is up 6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk. Likewise, Ripple is up 9% over the last 24 hours.

When bitcoin moves, it also pulls cryptocurrency-related stocks higher, as well. Consider the following jumps:

MicroStrategy NASDAQ:MSTR)

Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Canaan NASDAQ:CAN)

Xunlei Limited NASDAQ:XNET)

Riot Blockchain NASDAQ:RIOT)

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust OTC:GBTC)

How does the price of bitcoin affect these companies? And what do these big moves mean for investors?

So what

These companies all benefit from the rising price of bitcoin in different ways. Some companies hold bitcoin. Others mine bitcoin -- which is the process of unlocking a new supply of bitcoin tokens. And some sell hardware so other companies can mine bitcoin. Obviously, these businesses all have very different value propositions.

Companies that hold bitcoin are the best candidates to rise and fall with bitcoin's price. For example, MicroStrategy has cash on hand for working capital, but everything else is held in bitcoin reserves. As of Dec. 4, the company held 40,824 bitcoins. Its average price per bitcoin is around $11,600, so it's already seen an almost 80% return.

This quick appreciation is motivating MicroStrategy to buy more. In fact, it just issued $635 million in convertible notes for the express purpose of buying more bitcoin.

Another company that should move with bitcoin is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Even though it trades over the counter (OTC), it calls itself the first public exchange traded fund (ETF) for cryptocurrency that reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a bitcoin ETF, it holds bitcoin, logically meaning its price goes up and down with the cryptocurrency.

Moving to mining, Marathon Patent Group generates revenue directly from mining operations. Similarly, 99% of Riot Blockchain's revenue comes from mining.

Mining cryptocurrencies is expensive; the companies have to invest in facilities, computing power, and electricity for running computers and air conditioning to keep equipment from overheating. Bitcoin prices haven't kept up with mining costs in recent years, meaning both Marathon and Riot Blockchain have recorded massive operating losses in 2020 -- $4.9 million and $18.5 million, respectively.

With the rising value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, perhaps miners like Marathon Patent Group and Riot Blockchain can start turning some profits in 2021, which would be an encouraging development for shareholders.

Finally, we come to companies that could benefit indirectly from the rising price of bitcoin. Canaan manufactures equipment that can be used to mine bitcoin. As the price rises, it could inspire more mining activity, leading to increased sales for the company. However, it's important to note that this isn't a foregone conclusion. Miners are just as likely to purchase mining equipment from other companies.

For its part, Xunlei Limited operates a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) business. Blockchain is the promising technology that bitcoin lives on. Of all the moves today, this one is the biggest head-scratcher. Perhaps investors see the rising price of cryptocurrencies as validation of blockchain technology, giving investors hope for the future prospects of BaaS.

Now what

I'm not surprised to see bitcoin blasting higher. My thesis goes something like this: Bitcoin has a limited supply of tokens. Demand is growing from investors buying and holding, but also from corporate entities like MicroStrategy choosing to use and hold tokens. As bitcoin demand surges, limited supply could cause its value to increase steadily over time.

However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are very risky investments. They differ from stocks in a very important way. Stocks have intrinsic value; cryptocurrencies do not. If demand for any of these tokens drops to zero, then so will their values. By contrast, stocks represent a piece a a real-world business, meaning they have value.

Of all these bitcoin-related stocks, MicroStrategy is the most investable, in my opinion, because it has a business outside of bitcoin. The company has been in business for over 30 years and generates real revenue and cash flow.

The only difference between MicroStrategy and comparable technology companies is it's just holding bitcoin instead of excess cash. If bitcoin goes up, it'll prove to be a good strategy. Of course, if bitcoin plummets, this will destroy long-term shareholder value.",2020-12-16 00:00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/amex-dives-deeper-into-crypto-with-trading-platform-investment,"Why did this happen?

(Bloomberg) -- In an era of prosperity for investment banks, Credit Suisse Group AG is careening from one crisis to another and then another -- this time, with a $4.7 billion writedown tied to billionaire investor Bill Hwang’s trading blowout.The staggering hit -- the largest yet linked to market-shaking losses run up by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management -- prompted sweeping management changes at the Swiss bank Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on its checkered record of managing risks. It caps a catalog of costly errors at Credit Suisse -- most recently the collapse of Greensill Capital -- in what was supposed to be the start of steadier era under Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein.At a moment when investment banks are feasting on market activity and dealmaking, Credit Suisse is under mounting pressure to persuade shareholders and clients it can put its house in order and remain a vital, independent force in global banking. After the firm announced plans to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their recommendation for the stock, which already was breaking with peers in tumbling this year.“The ongoing negative newsflow could have an impact on the remainder” of Credit Suisse’s businesses, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan wrote in a note, lowering their rating to neutral from overweight. “Besides the impact from various management changes and regulatory oversight,” they wrote, the bank “might have to pursue a strategy of ‘capital preservation’” that could restrain growth.David Herro at Harris Associates, a top shareholder of Credit Suisse, said the bank’s losses should serve as a “wakeup call” to expedite cultural change as Chairman Urs Rohner prepares to hand over to Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio at the end of the month. Rohner has offered to forgo his compensation for 2020 of 1.5 million francs.Another long-standing backer of the bank, Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, stands to suffer a personal hit as well after vehicles linked to him invested about $200 million in funds Credit Suisse ran with Greensill, according to people familiar with the matter. As former head of the Qatar Investment Authority, Sheik Hamad had made Qatar one of the Swiss bank’s largest shareholders.Acknowledging the need for deep change, Credit Suisse on Tuesday replaced its investment bank head and chief risk officer, along with a handful of other executives. Gottstein, who took over in February last year after a spying scandal toppled his predecessor, told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung that the bank has no sacred cows with regard to strategy.“Serious lessons will be learned,” he pledged in a statement. The Archegos loss “is unacceptable.”While the Swiss bank wasn’t the only firm that helped Hwang’s family office lever up large positions in a relatively small slate of stocks, rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed to unwind their exposures quickly with minimal damage.Credit Suisse has now offloaded the bulk of its Archegos exposure, helped by a $2.3 billion sale this week. But the impact of that latest disposal and any remaining positions could affect second-quarter results, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The dual hits from Archegos and Greensill have put the bank on track for its second straight quarterly loss, at a time when investment banks around the world are still focused on the windfall unleashed by the market turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic. The five largest U.S. firms boosted trading revenue by more than a third last year to the highest in at least a decade.JPMorgan’s Wall Street unit generated its most fourth-quarter revenue and profit ever. Deutsche Bank is among firms that have said their investment banks are off to a strong start this year. And Jefferies Financial Group Inc. already reported an 81% jump in revenue from capital markets in the fiscal first quarter that ended Feb. 28.In an update on its underlying businesses Tuesday, Credit Suisse noted that issues such as Archegos were negating the “very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses” as well as higher profits in wealth and asset management units.The firm is still set to give an update on the effect of last month’s collapse of Greensill Capital, which helped manage $10 billion of investment funds the Swiss bank offered to asset management clients. Credit Suisse is leaning toward letting clients take the hit of expected losses in those funds, a person familiar with the discussions said.Among the executives to leave over the missteps are investment bank head Brian Chin and risk chief Lara Warner. Gottstein previously removed Eric Varvel from his role running asset management after Greensill’s downfall. In a memo to staff Monday, Credit Suisse also announced at least five other departures, including equities trading chief Paul Galietto.Christian Meissner, the former Bank of America Corp. executive who joined Credit Suisse in October, will take over from Chin next month. Joachim Oechslin will become risk chief in the interim, a role he held until 2019 when Warner took over. Thomas Grotzer was named interim head of compliance.The bank cut its dividend proposal for 2020 to 10 centimes a share, from about 29 centimes, and suspended its share buyback until its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of capital strength, returns to the targeted level. Credit Suisse said it expects a CET1 ratio of at least 12% in the first quarter. It had aimed for at least 12.5% in the first half of this year. Top executives’ bonuses for last year have been scrapped.Credit Suisse Payout Pause Won’t Halt Archegos Fallout: ReactThe Zurich-based bank was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, and had tried to reach some sort of standstill to figure out how to unwind positions without sparking panic, people familiar with the matter have said. The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses.“Almost two weeks in, it is still not clear how the bank managed to take a 4.4 billion-franc charge for one client in the prime brokerage business, which we estimate generates less than 1 billion francs per annum in revenues,” JPMorgan’s analysts wrote.Among big banks that dealt with Archegos, only Nomura Holdings Inc. has signaled the potential to also take a multibillion-dollar hit, saying it could lose as much as $2 billion.Credit Suisse’s latest trades came more than a week after several rivals dumped their shares. The bank hit the market with block trades tied to ViacomCBS Inc., Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and Farfetch Ltd., a person with knowledge of the matter said. The stocks traded substantially below where they were last month before Hwang’s family office imploded.In addition to the Archegos writedown, Credit Suisse may need to set aside 2 billion francs over the coming years for litigation tied to Greensill, according to the JPMorgan analysts.Startup lender Greensill Capital had borrowed from the bank and helped manage a group of debt funds that were marketed as among its safest products. Now the funds are frozen and being wound down after Lex Greensill’s firm collapsed amid doubts about its lending practices.Credit Suisse said it will provide an update on the funds in the next few days.(Adds shareholder comment in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/top-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-ether-to-take-the-reigns-btc-weakens-crypto-bull-run-202012161039,"Bitcoin is holding firmly to the support above $19,000, but its ascending wedge pattern formation is a bearish signal.

Ethereum eyes $600 after closing the day above the 50 SMA on the 4-hour chart.

Ripple forms a double-bottom pattern ahead of a possible rebound to price levels beyond $0.6.

The widespread crypto correction in the market seems to have humbled the bulls who outperformed themselves in November and the first week of December. The majority of crypto assets have remained sluggish since the losses incurred last week.

Ripple is among the worst hit, losing over 17% in seven days and 8% in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to hold between $19,000 and $19,500, while Ethereum is above $580, but upward movements are limited under $600.

Interestingly, some altcoins in the top 50 seem to have ignored the widespread bearish wave, recording incredible double-digit gains. For instance, UMA is up 32% to trade at $9.7, Kusama up 12% to exchange hands at $56.6 and Zilliqa has spiked 15.6% to trade at $0.037.

Bitcoin seems to be delaying the inevitable breakdown

The flagship cryptocurrency has remained sluggish between $19,000 and $19,500. Such choppy markets are difficult to trade for both the bears and the bulls. Therefore, everyone seems to be waiting for a confirmed breakout above $19,500 or a breakdown under $19,000.

The formation of an ascending wedge pattern hints at a potentially massive correction from the current price level. This bearish outlook forms when an asset's price ascends with pivot highs and lows while converging at an apex.

A breakdown tends to occur before the trendlines cross. An ascending wedge breakdown is usually confirmed by decreasing volume (highlighting a divergence between volume and price). Breakdowns are generally fast and drastic, and could see Bitcoin dive to refresh tentative support levels at $18,000 and $17,500, respectively.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

On the upside, Bitcoin is likely to pull to higher levels, perhaps beyond $20,000 if the price closes the day above $19,500. If push comes to shove, defending support at $19,000 is still a relatively bullish signal.

Ethereum upswing depends on a crucial support level

Ether appears to be defying the bearish outlook after holding above the 50 Simple Moving Average. A delay in recovery is anticipated at $590 but once broken, Ethereum could spike to $600 and perhaps extend the bullish leg towards $620.

The gradually building bullish grip seems to have been validated by the Relative Strength Index after bouncing off support at the midline. This indicator tracks the strength of a trend and whether an asset is overbought or oversold. For now, room for growth is available until the RSI hits the overbought region.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

A bearish outlook would come into the picture if Ether sliced under the 50 SMA. Moreover, closing the day below the next support at $580 may see sell orders surge. If enough volume is created, a breakdown back to $540 will most likely occur.

Ripple on the brink of accelerating upwards

XRP bulls are nursing wounds after suffering dearly from the extended downtrend. A monthly low seems to have been reached at $0.43, hinting at a possible local bottom. The region also happens to coincide with another bottom, formed during the correction in November.

If the double-bottom pattern support holds, Ripple may rebound extensively, perhaps past $0.5 and toward $0.6. Some resistance should be anticipated at the 200 SMA ($0.5), the 50 SMA ($0.525) and the 100 SMA ($0.575). The oversold RSI adds credibility to the bullish outlook, hinting at bullish reversal is around the corner.

XRP/USD 4-hour chart

On the downside, the bearish outlook may continue to dominate for the rest of this week if the double-bottom pattern support is invalidated. The declines that come into play could push XRP to $0.4 and $0.35 before a significant rebound occurs.",,https://fortune.com/2020/12/16/20000-bitcoin-caps-grayscales-incredible-year/,These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,2020-12-16 00:00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/16/should-you-use-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-to-invest-i/,"When it comes to investing in bitcoin, you have two basic options. You can buy and hold bitcoin directly, or you can use another type of vehicle that invests in bitcoin on investors' behalf. Since there are no bitcoin mutual funds or ETFs -- at least not yet -- that leaves the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) as the primary way investors can put their money to work in bitcoin without having to buy the digital currency themselves.

However, there are some things investors should know before deciding to buy shares. In this Nov. 30 Fool Live video clip, Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel, CFP, and Industry Focus host Jason Moser discuss the major drawbacks of using this alternative bitcoin investment instead of simply buying the cryptocurrency itself.

Jason Moser: Let's see. We've got a question from Srinivas, who asks, what are your thoughts on the crypto ETF GBTC? I don't know yet, but I want to.

Matt Frankel: I do and I would love to take that one.

Moser: OK. Well, go for it.

Frankel: That is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Moser: There you go.

Frankel: Right now, there are no bitcoin mutual funds or ETFs. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is intended to fill that gap until the SEC actually approves a bitcoin-based ETF. It's a way for people to get exposure to bitcoin without actually having to buy it. It works like a fund, where they pool investor's money and buy bitcoin. The problem is it trades at a massive premium to the value of the bitcoin it owns, like in the 20%-30% range usually. I haven't checked recently. But historically, it's traded for at least to 20%-30% premium over the value of the underlying bitcoin. So if you want to invest.

Moser: Why do you think that's the case? Why do you think they will do that?

Frankel: At first, I think it was because bitcoin was difficult to buy, and it's still not that as easy to buy as some other assets. It trades at a massive premium, and Grayscale takes a 2% fee per year for storing the bitcoin. That's a two percent management fee. It's a pretty high fee in the ETF and mutual fund world. The costs in the premium make it -- I'd stay away. There are few situations where I would recommend buying actual bitcoin, but that's one of them. If it's between that, I'm buying bitcoin.

Moser: Yeah. I wonder if it has funds due. I mean, funds make investing more accessible for a lot of folks. Maybe the demand for shares of that fund are higher than the value simply because, like you said, people feel like it's an easier way to actually get hold of the underlying asset without having to actually own the asset. Most people can't really necessarily got there and buy bitcoin without knowing a thing or two. All those e-platforms like Square and PayPal are only making a lot easier.

Frankel: Yeah. I mean, if you look at the ETFs that own gold, for example, they have management fees because it costs money to store, secure things like that.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: They generally trade at somewhat of a premium to the value of the gold that they own. Not 20%-30 %, but somewhat of a premium. It's just the costs are kind of, in my mind, outrageous for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Moser: What's the cost for storing? I mean, I understand the cost involved with hunting for bitcoin, the cost involved for mining for bitcoin. But what's the costs for storing it? Isn't that just memory?

Frankel: There's a lot of cybersecurity measures that need to be taken, a lot of equipment that needs to be bought. If you want to keep your bitcoin in cold storage, meaning offline storage, you need somewhere to actually do that. I mean, it's not giant cost, but you need computing equipment. If you're holding billions of dollars in bitcoin, you need some of the best cybersecurity operations in the world helping out with that.

Moser: Yeah, I guess so.

Frankel: Because you don't want that hacked and lost. If you remember in the early days of cryptocurrency, you would hear about a breach of them and exchange almost every other week, where like $100 million of cryptocurrency just vanished and stuff like that. You don't want that to happen. There's security costs. Like storing gold, you have to pay for the vault to keep it in and stuff like that. I mean, there are costs associated with it. It's not two percent, and that's why they make a profit. But there is some cost to actually storing and keeping gold. As more investors put their money and they have to buy bitcoin, which there's fees with that due.

Moser: Yeah. That's a good point.

Frankel: There are costs associated with it.",2020-12-16 00:00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/new-crypto-fund-is-trading-at-369-premium-over-assets-it-holds,"Why did this happen?

“Breaking the $20,000 psychological barrier was a strong bullish signal allowing bitcoin to set a new record high,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at crypto quant trading firm ExoAlpha. However, Le Rest cautioned about crypto’s classic gyrations possibly affecting the market. “Volatility is very high and small pullbacks have been witnessed along the way.”

Indeed, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been picking up and will be something to watch over the balance of December.

“Traders should be careful and on the lookout for stronger pullbacks, especially with year-end approaching and traders looking to close their 2020 profit-and-loss,” added LeRest.

Chris Thomas, head of digital assets Swissquote Bank concurred, saying the most recent move feels too strong for his taste. “I’m just waiting for a few big sellers to come back to the market and take profits,” Thomas said. “Let’s look ahead to the next few weeks. Institutional volumes will drop significantly through Christmas so the market will be driven by retail until early January.”

“This should cause us to keep the high volatility, but we’ve got to also be aware there may be a chance of testing $20,000 to the downside,” added Thomas.

Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader, noted “fear of missing out” or FOMO as a factor playing into the market’s fervor. “There is of course an element of FOMO in this but the fundamentals are stable as pyramids,” Kugelberg said. “I have said $30,000 before summer but by the looks of this, that might be a very low bid.”

Ethereum network locked value at all-time high

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was up Thursday trading around $640 and climbing 2.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The amount of crypto “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is at $16 billion as of press time, increasing over 2,200% from the $690 million locked at the start of 2020.

Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading for blockchain ecosystem provider NEM, told CoinDesk many investors continue to overlook the Ethereum network and its alternative assets, also known as altcoins.

“While bitcoin has largely dominated the narrative, I believe investors should look to altcoins that have tremendous amounts of development in both the core technology and usership, yet are still a fair way off their all-time highs,” said Pelecanos. “I am expecting to see the price of these altcoins, such as ETH and XEM, rally hard when the BTC price inevitably slows down.”

Other markets

Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Thursday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):

In addition, prices for COMP, the governance token for the Ethereum-based lending protocol Compound, jumped on the news that Compound Labs will build a new blockchain to provide money market services across multiple networks.

As CoinDesk reported, the new blockchain could be significant because those new supported assets won’t be limited to blockchains – it is designed to also support the forthcoming and rumored central bank digital currencies. Like Compound v1, the new blockchain will also be governed by the COMP token. Once it goes live, it will add more value to COMP holders. At the time of writing, prices for COMP were traded at $167.14, up 9.43% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari.

Bitcoin hit a fresh record high above $23,000 on Thursday, extending a wild rally for the cryptocurrency that has seen it more than triple in value this year. The world's most-valuable digital currency surged 12% to $23,421, according to crypto market data provider Coin Metrics, taking its year-to-date gains to more than 200%. Bitcoin only just smashed the $20,000 mark on Wednesday. Bitcoin later pared back its gains slightly, trading over 9% higher at about $22,787 by 7:30 a.m. ET. Crypto bulls have pointed to increased demand from institutional investors, pitching bitcoin as a hedge against inflation like gold amid unprecedented U.S. coronavirus stimulus. A recent JPMorgan note claimed such investor appetite would boost inflows into funds tracking bitcoin to the detriment of gold. On Tuesday, U.K. asset manager Ruffer revealed it had around 2.5% of its portfolio invested in bitcoin ""as a small but potent insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world's major currencies."" The company managed £20.3 billion ($27.6 billion) in assets by the end of November.

Bitcoin's 2020 performance has reminded many market watchers of its frenzied rally to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by a sharp pullback the following year. However, crypto fans claim this year's rally is unlike 2017 as it's being driven by institutional buying rather than retail speculation. ""This run is completely different to the one in 2017,"" said Eric Demuth, CEO and co-founder of cryptocurrency trading app Bitpanda. ""Back then, the price was driven by mainly retail investors."" ""Now, we additionally have billionaires praising bitcoin and investment funds securing significant positions worth hundreds of millions. The big players that were once very distant from bitcoin and were outspoken critics are now joining in with the run.""

Digital currency exchange Coinbase is going public as renewed investor interest in cryptocurrencies has pushed bitcoin to an all-time high.

California-based Coinbase, founded in 2012, has long been a go-to spot to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and the company has grown into the largest digital currency exchange in the U.S.

The company's filing comes on the heels of a surge in the price of bitcoin. On Thursday the largest cryptocurrency rallied more than 12% to top $23,000 for the first time on record, according to crypto market data provider Coin Metrics. The move came just one day after the cryptocurrency topped the $20,000 mark for the first time.

With Thursday's jump, bitcoin is now up more than 200% for the year. Bitcoin has garnered much attention from investors lately, and Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller are among those who have come out in favor of the cryptocurrency. Large financial companies like PayPal and Fidelity have also made moves in the space.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, submitted a draft registration statement, or S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to go public. Coinbase has been at the vanguard of those offering retail investors in the U.S. a venue to buy and sell bitcoin and other nascent digital assets.

After breaking through the key $20,000 level for the first time on Wednesday, leading digital currency bitcoin is soaring again. As of 10:50 a.m. EST on Thursday, bitcoin was trading for more than $23,200, a gain of about 11% over the past 24 hours and a rally of more than 25% over the past week.

As a result of the move, several cryptocurrency stocks are trading higher as well. In no particular order:

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust OTC:GBTC)

Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Canaan NASDAQ:CAN)

In addition to these, Square (NYSE:SQ), which not only facilitates bitcoin buying and selling through its Cash App, but owns a significant amount of bitcoin as an investment, was higher by nearly 4%. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which bought more than $400 million in bitcoin to hold already and is planning to raise capital to buy even more, is also higher on the day.

So what

There are several potential reasons why bitcoin has been moving sharply higher.

Fears of currency devaluation is a big one. Many bitcoin investors believe that the massive amounts of stimulus being injected into economies around the world (read: money being printed), will lead to high inflation. Since there is a finite supply of bitcoin in existence, it is thought of as a naturally inflation-resistant asset, similar to gold.

There has also been an uptick in institutional interest in bitcoin. I already mentioned that Square and MicroStrategy are now holding bitcoin on their balance sheets, and these are just two corporate examples. A U.K. asset manager with over $27 billion in assets under management recently revealed that about 2.5% of its assets were invested in bitcoin.

Additionally, there is renewed hope that bitcoin could finally begin to achieve mainstream adoption as a payment method. While PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) recently announced that its customers would be able to buy and sell bitcoin through the platform, the company also said its long-term plans include making bitcoin usable as a payment method with its 13 million merchants.

Now what

At the current price level, bitcoin's market capitalization is about $425 billion -- making all of the bitcoin in existence roughly as valuable as Walmart. If institutional demand continues and bitcoin ends up gaining mainstream traction, there could certainly be more upside ahead. But it's also important for investors to know it's not a smooth ride. Bitcoin can move to the downside just as quickly, so invest accordingly.",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/12/17/top-crypto-analyst-tracks-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-trajectories-after-big-breakout-says-two-small-cap-altcoins-set-to-soar/,"Analyst Michaël van de Poppe is assessing the crypto markets as Bitcoin continues its big break above $20,000.

The popular trader says BTC is just getting started and points to increasing support from institutional investors as a foundation of support for the top cryptocurrency.

“This all-time high is significant, but it’s more significant that the market is maturing.

More options for bigger players to allocate money towards crypto… this all-time high is the start of the cycle.”

If the second-largest crypto asset Ethereum can sustain its momentum, Van de Poppe says a rally to $1,000 is likely.

However, if BTC pulls back below the $20,000 mark, he expects a drop to the $440 region.

“Ethereum is going upwards partly due to Bitcoin and partly due to the fact that there is going to be CME futures launched in 2021, which is massively bullish in the long run.”

The analyst says XRP has hit its first target price after bouncing off support at the $0.45 level. He says the next level of resistance is now at around $0.65.

“Ripple has been seeing a massive retracement after that peak high at $0.75. Higher timeframes (daily) we structured the $0.45-0.48 zone as a support zone. Now it’s up 14% since this area. Pretty decent.”

Van de Poppe is also tracking a pair of altcoins that he believes have potential moving forward.

He’s been increasing his altcoin exposure in recent weeks and is looking toward a major breakout for the high throughput crypto asset Zilliqa (ZIL), which is currently at about $0.037 according to CoinMarketCap.

His first target is the $0.047 to $0.051 area, and his second is the $0.07 to $0.076 region.

The analyst is also bullish on the smart contract platform Elrond (EGLD).

He says traders may have missed the ideal entry point in the $17 to $18 range. At this point, Van de Poppe says a test of the asset’s all-time high at $25.38 is just a matter of time.

He’s expecting a move to the $28 to $30 area.

""My thoughts haven't changed,"" Cuban told Forbes of the cryptocurrency on Dec. 8 — eight days before bitcoin hit a record high of $20,600 on Wednesday — for a story published Thursday.

Bitcoin, Cuban said, is ""a store of value...that is more religion than solution to any problem.""

And bitcoin or any cryptocurrency will not replace fiat, or government-backed, currency, he said.

""No matter how much [bitcoin] fans want to pretend that it's a hedge against doomsday scenarios, it is not,"" Cuban said. ""Countries will take steps to protect their currencies and their ability to tax, so the more people believe this is anything more than a store of value, the more risk of government intervention they face.""

Those who argue in favor of bitcoin often say it is a hedge against inflation and the U.S. dollar, and that it will survive any economic or infrastructure collapse (except for downed internet), comparing it to gold.

Cuban agrees bitcoin is like gold in that it is a store of value, but because by its code the supply of bitcoin is limited, as demand fluctuates, the price will be volatile. ""But,"" he said, ""as long as people accept [bitcoin] as a digital version of gold, it's investable.""

Investable, of course, doesn't mean it's a sure bet. Though Cuban himself has previously invested in businesses built on cryptocurrency and even in bitcoin, he frequently warns against it, calling bitcoin a ""gamble."" And when it comes to gambling, you need to be prepared to lose that money.

In fact, Cuban previously told Wired he would ""rather have bananas than bitcoin,"" because at least as food, bananas have intrinsic value.

He reiterated the point to Forbes: ""[Bitcoin] is what it is, something that enough people have agreed upon is an investable asset,"" he said. But ""a banana has more utility, potassium, is a valuable nutrient to every person on the planet.""

For the investor to change his mind about bitcoin, ""it would have to be so easy to use, [like] it's a no-brainer,"" Cuban said on ""The Pomp Podcast"" in April.

""It would have to be completely friction-free and understandable by everybody first."" So easy, in fact, that ""grandma could do it.""

Top US currency regulator on what's next for crypto as Bitcoin boom continues

Digital currency exchange Coinbase is going public as renewed investor interest in cryptocurrencies has pushed bitcoin to an all-time high. The IPO comes amid a record-breaking run for Bitcoin, which broke through $23,000. Brian Brooks, acting comptroller of the currency and former chief legal officer at Coinbase, joined ""Squawk Box"" on Friday to discuss.",2020-12-18 00:00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/business/dealbook/coinbase-ipo-bitcoin.html,"Rebel money goes mainstream

Cryptocurrency is having a banner week in an already big year. In the past day, the value of Bitcoin set a new high and the digital currency exchange Coinbase, the most valuable American crypto company, announced that it had filed for an I.P.O. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

How is this going to work? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are borderless, decentralized assets championed in particular by libertarians, anarchists and others who reject centralized control and regulation. Coinbase is in the business of popularizing these rebel currencies via an app that makes it easy for anyone to trade crypto like they would stocks or bonds. An I.P.O. would thrust Coinbase — and by extension, cryptocurrency — further into the mainstream, with regulators, bankers and other trappings of official legitimacy. And in an already heady environment for I.P.O.s, the listing presents both practical and philosophical problems.

Coinbase is “spiritually” built for an offering involving digital tokens, its co-founder Fred Ehrsam recently told Fortune. Crypto enthusiasts would love that, but the S.E.C. may not. And for all of the bullishness about Bitcoin at the moment, tapping traditional sources of institutional funds is probably a more lucrative route.

But the traditional underwriting process could be fraught, too. Misreading retail demand in the market debuts of Airbnb and DoorDash made other I.P.O. hopefuls rethink their plans. Adding crypto true believers into this mix only increases the difficulty. That could make a direct listing more appropriate, from a pricing efficiency view, as previous reports have suggested. (Recent changes to listing rules would allow companies to raise money alongside a direct listing, which wasn’t possible before.)

What’s it worth? Last valued at $8 billion in a funding round in 2018, Coinbase is surely worth more now, thanks to the surge in crypto prices and the frenzy for tech stocks. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s C.E.O., regularly blogs his thoughts, and is rarely shy about it, but the disclosure rules around public offerings mean that we may not hear much from him about the I.P.O. specifically. He did, however, address the Bitcoin bump recently:

“While it’s great to see market rallies and see news organizations turn attention to this emerging asset class in a new way, we cannot emphasize enough how important it is to understand that investing in crypto is not without risk.”

Whatever stock investors think Coinbase is worth as it prepares to list, crypto investors are convinced that Bitcoin’s long-term prospects are bright. “It’s gold 2.0 for sure,” Daniel Polotsky of CoinFlip, a Bitcoin A.T.M. company, told DealBook. “It’s going to eat gold’s lunch.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine could get U.S. approval today. The F.D.A. is expected to grant emergency authorization to the treatment, making it the second coronavirus inoculation available in the U.S., after Pfizer’s. But states have received fewer doses of Pfizer’s vaccine than expected, which the company suggested was because the Trump administration hadn’t told it where to send them.",2020-12-18 00:00:00,https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-exchange-coinbase-files-for-ipo-with-sec/592446/,"Dive Brief:

Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO), the company said Thursday in a blog post. The draft registration statement will become effective once the regulator completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions, the company said.

The company did not speculate on the prospective value of a listing. But Bitcoin, the flagship currency in which Coinbase trades, has tripled in value in 2020 — starting the year at $7,194 before dipping as low as $4,106 at the start of the pandemic and charging to a high of $23,642 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin surpassed $20,000 for the first time Wednesday.

A public listing would force Coinbase to disclose its profits or revenue figures — something the somewhat secretive company has never done. Coinbase was valued at $8 billion after a $300 million funding round in 2018. A handful of smaller crypto-based companies trade publicly but none the size of Coinbase.

Dive Insight:

Coinbase's post Thursday did not speculate on timing, but the company stands to be one of the most eagerly anticipated IPOs of 2021. IPOs have raised more than $160 billion this year on U.S. exchanges, according to The Wall Street Journal. Sixty-three companies debuted listings in December, raising more than $23 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

DoorDash, on its first day of trading last week, closed at 86% above its initial price. Airbnb last week began its first-ever day of trading at $148 despite being valued at $68 at IPO.

Beyond this week's high-water mark in Bitcoin's value, the crypto space has seen a warming trend this year as businesses have shown more acceptance of the once-fringe investment.

PayPal said in October it would let U.S. account holders buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency in their PayPal digital wallets and use digital coins to pay for purchases starting early next year.

JPMorgan Chase this spring said it extended banking services to Coinbase and fellow crypto exchange Gemini. Other institutions such as Northern Trust, Standard Chartered and Fidelity are exploring crypto custody, American Banker reported Wednesday.

And a number of companies over the past few months — notably, MicroStrategy, Square and MassMutual — have plowed millions of dollars in spare cash in Bitcoin.

""It is a watershed moment for the asset class, both as a form of legitimization, and by providing a way for investors to bet on the crypto industry without betting on a specific asset,"" Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, told Bloomberg. Samani is an investor in Coinbase.

Coinbase, which reportedly counts about 35 million users, was founded in 2012 by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong and former Goldman Sachs trader Fred Ehrsam. New York's Department of Financial Services granted the company a BitLicense in 2017, and the platform is now licensed to operate in 44 states and Washington, D.C. It's also accessible in more than 100 countries outside the U.S.

The company has a history of keeping its finances close to the vest. It fought the IRS for two years after the agency in 2016 demanded to see details of 500,000 Coinbase user accounts. Coinbase in 2018 gave the agency access to 13,000 accounts.

Armstrong also made headlines in September for enacting a strict policy banning political activism at work. Coinbase offered buyouts to 60 employees who disagreed with the policy, according to Bloomberg.

Coinbase could lose more employees once it lists — particularly long-haulers for whom the IPO would offer liquidity for angel investments and the base to launch their own startups, Nic Carter, co-founder of crypto researcher Coin Metrics, told Bloomberg.

Armstrong, for his part, warned investors in a separate blog post this week about the Bitcoin value rally, saying Coinbase takes a ""long-term view of the market.""

""While we're always excited to see increased interest in crypto, it's also important to point out that this is not only a time of high volumes, but also price volatility,"" he wrote.

Coinbase has raised $547 million in the private market, according to Crunchbase. It is also a founding member of Diem, the digital currency project once known as Libra.",2020-12-18 07:47:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/goldman-says-bitcoin-is-tracking-copper-a-key-proxy-for-global-growth.html,"An illustration of bitcoin on Euro banknotes.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs have identified a surprisingly similar trend between the world's most valuable virtual currency and a base metal with a reputation as a barometer for the global economy. Bitcoin and copper prices have both been on a tear for most of this year, hitting record-highs amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""Both institutional investors and wealthy individuals avoid cryptocurrencies due to its inherent transparency issues, while speculative retail investment causes Bitcoin to act as an excessively risky asset,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note published Thursday.

""In fact, since the depths of the first lockdown Bitcoin's rise has closely tracked that of copper, a key proxy for global growth,"" they added. Bitcoin prices have skyrocketed. The volatile cryptocurrency, in a move that reminded many market participants of a similar rally in 2017, climbed above $20,000 for the first time in its history on Wednesday. It has since breached $23,000, according to crypto market data provider Coin Metrics, before paring gains on Friday to trade at around $22,899. In mid-March, during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, bitcoin traded below $5,000. The rising popularity of bitcoin has seen it become an asset that is widely traded, much like fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, copper prices breached $8,000 per metric ton on Friday, its highest level since February 2013. Three-month copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have since pared gains, trading at $7,991 during lunchtime deals. The commodity is up more than 28% year-to-date, on pace for its fourth positive year in five. Copper's 2020 bull run coincides with a rally among other stocks and risk assets in recent weeks, with market sentiment improving on positive news about Covid-19 vaccines. Copper — sometimes dubbed Dr. Copper — has a reputation among market watchers as a barometer for the global economy. The base metal is viewed in this way because of its broad range of end-uses — both in construction and in consumer products such as cars and consumer appliances. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs said it was ""highly probable"" that by the first half of 2022 copper prices would test the existing record highs of $10,170 set in 2011.

A herd of new, big investors are scooping up bitcoin this year as the price more than doubles. Investors who bought at least 1,000 bitcoins — worth roughly $23 million at Friday's price — and have had an account open for less than a year, drove significant demand since September, according to data firm Chainalysis. The new cohort together bought half a million bitcoins, or $11.5 billion worth, in the past three months. In the time these new investors accelerated their buying spree, bitcoin's price more than doubled from $10,000 level. The new demand has helped fuel the cryptocurrency's rally to an all-time high, according to Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis.

""The role of institutional investors is becoming ever clearer in the data,"" Gradwell said in a note to clients Friday. ""Demand is being driven by North American investors on fiat exchanges, with greater demand from institutional buyers."" The surge in demand from wealthy Wall Street investors marks a sharp turn-around from bitcoin's first run-up three years ago. The 2017 rally was driven by retail investors, many of whom who bet on bitcoin and other smaller cryptocurrencies out of speculation. Bitcoin became a household name when it first neared $20,000 that year. It crashed soon after, losing 80% of its value in the following months.

Bitcoin crossed $23,000 for the first time ever this week, bringing its year to date gains to more than 200%. The cryptocurrency has recovered roughly a quarter of its value since Friday, and is on pace for its best week since May 2019. The price resurgence in 2020 in part has been fueled by well-known Wall Street billionaires publicly backing bitcoin. Analysts say that gave confidence to otherwise skeptical, mainstream investors. Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones have both invested in the cryptocurrency and highlighted its potential as a hedge against inflation. Meanwhile, Square, MicroStrategy and Mass Mutual have used their own balance sheets to buy cryptocurrency. PayPal also added the ability for clients to buy bitcoin, which has opened up the market to millions of new buyers. ""We are seeing institutional capital flowing in at the fastest pace in the history of our business, and it is being deployed by some of the world's largest institutions and some of the most famous investors,"" Michael Sonnenshein, managing director at Grayscale Investments, told CNBC in a phone interview Friday. Flows into Grayscale's publicly traded Bitcoin Trust have increased roughly 6x from a year ago, he said.

Just as during Bitcoin's previous bull run, while the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) races past new records, commentators and proponents are, again, weighing in with sky-high valuations for the cryptocurrency.

Scott Minerd, chief investment officer (CIO) at Guggenheim Partners, recently told Bloomberg that the firm's valuation models suggest that Bitcoin could go as high as $400,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $22,954. Thursday morning, it whizzed past the $23,000 mark and peaked at $23,653, setting a new record in the process.

Guggenheim Partners does not own Bitcoin. But it has reserved the right to set aside as much as 10% from its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund to invest in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a Bitcoin holding company that trades in OTC markets. An increase in Bitcoin price will propel GBTC's share price upwards and generate profits for Guggenheim. The investment firm has been monitoring Bitcoin prices since it was valued at $10,000, said Minerd. ""Ultimately, we are going to buy it,"" he promised.

Key Takeaways Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Partners says a Bitcoin could be worth $400,000, based on the firm's valuation model that takes into account the cryptocurrency's scarcity and inflation of the dollar.

CoinFund's Seth Ginns has predicted a $1 million valuation for Bitcoin based on Its four-year halving cycle.

For now, though, Minerd is preaching the Bitcoin gospel and justifying a high valuation for the cryptocurrency. ""It's based on the scarcity and relative valuation such as things like gold as a percentage of GDP. So … Bitcoin actually has a lot of the attributes of gold and at the same time has an unusual value in terms of transactions,"" he said.

According to Minerd, the Fed's policy of ""rampant money printing"" during the current pandemic-induced economic downturn was another reason for the valuation. The Federal Reserve has pumped as much as $9 trillion into the U.S. economy since the pandemic's start. The noisy whirr of the Fed's money-printing machine is a contrast to Bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million. The resulting scarcity is supposed to make the cryptocurrency a store of value.

To the $1 Million Moon?

At Bitcoin's current price, Minerd's price estimate might seem outlandish. But CoinFund's Seth Ginns left that estimate in the dust by forecasting a $1 million price target for the cryptocurrency. He said the ""pattern recognition"" of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, presumably the duration between its halving periods, meant that a price range of between $150,000 and $400,000 was a ""base case.""

Ginns also made an improbable comparison between the share price movement for electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Bitcoin, saying that the cryptocurrency’s rapid institutionalization could propel it to toward a range of $500,000 to $1 million in the next two years. Thereafter, its price would consolidate, he said.",2020-12-18 16:30:15.234000+00:00,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin,"From financial apps to publicly traded funds to crypto-exchanges, there are now a multitude of options for investing in bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains risky and volatile, so individuals should invest small amounts, keep their accounts secure, and think long term.

Bitcoin's dramatic price rise since its 2009 debut is attracting both institutional and individual investors.

Visit Business Insider's Investing Reference library for more stories.

Bitcoin is possibly the most fashionable investment of the past decade. It has appreciated in value by anything from 717,900% to just shy of one billion percent (depending on your starting figure) over the last 10 years or so. Either way, it's one of the best-performing financial assets in recent history.

But while bitcoin is certainly the talk of the town, much of it remains shrouded in mystery. It's not clear to newcomers how best to invest in the cryptocurrency, with banks and most mainstream brokerage platforms refusing to handle it. Plus, its price swings can be frighteningly volatile by the standards of traditional stock and bond markets.

Let's demystify how to invest in bitcoin: the various places to buy it, the risks and rewards, and strategies for safely ensuring a higher return.

Why invest in bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of private, electronic money whose transactions are validated using cryptography, the science of encrypting and decrypting information. Since its launch in January 2009, it has come to be traded amid the belief that its software-enforced cap to 21 million bitcoins will ensure that it only appreciates in value over the long term.

""The best argument for Bitcoin's future success is the same argument long used for gold, diamonds and collectibles: It has been designed to have a limited supply and cannot be counterfeited,"" says Bob Fitzsimmons, the executive VP of Fixed Income, Commodities, and Stock Lending at Wedbush Securities.

The appeal of bitcoin's 21-million finite supply became more pronounced in the context of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which has brought record-low interest rates and ""unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus,"" says Fitzsimmons.

But even before the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin has enjoyed significant longer-term price increases. Having been worth around $1 at the beginning of 2010, it reached a new all-time high of $23,770.85 on Dec. 17, 2020.

It hasn't been a smooth ascent, though. Over the years, the cryptocurrency's price has bounced all over the place, sometimes plunging by hundreds of dollars in hours. It hit an all-time high of $19,783 in December 2017, too — before falling over the next couple of years by thousands. In fact, in November 2020 it crashed by $3,000, before climbing again.

Given such price swings, bitcoin can be loosely classified in the same investment league as growth and tech stocks, which have provided investors with higher-than-average returns, in exchange for taking on higher-than-average risk.

Buying and investing in bitcoin

Assuming that they're willing to accept the risk, investors interested in buying and investing in bitcoin have a number of options at their disposal. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Bitcoin trusts and funds

For those who aren't keen on the idea of actually handling or owning bitcoin themselves, one simple option is to buy shares in a publicly traded bitcoin trust. Similar to ETFs or mutual funds, these offer a portfolio that holds or trades the currency.

""The easiest way to buy bitcoin is through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) because it tracks the cryptocurrency and trades via the traditional financial market,"" says Ari Wald, the MD of the Institutional Portfolio Strategy team at Oppenheimer & Co.

Besides the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (which is by far the largest), other bitcoin trusts or funds include:

The main catch: Fees for funds and trusts can be fairly high. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust charging an annual management fee of 2%, for example. Like others, it ""also trades at a substantial premium,"" relative to the value of the bitcoins it holds, Wald notes.

Financial and investment apps

Recently, there has been a small number of financial and investment apps jumping into the cryptocurrency fray.



For example, in November 2020, PayPal began offering its US customers the capability to buy, sell, and make purchases with bitcoin, along with three other cryptocurrencies (ethereum, bitcoin cash, and litecoin).

""The biggest obstacle [for bitcoin buying and selling] has always been having to open an account with a bitcoin exchange and providing documents to verify your identity. Because hundreds of millions of people already have PayPal accounts, they can skip all of that hassle,"" says Glen Goodman, an investment expert and author of The Crypto Trader.

However, there are downsides to buying bitcoin with PayPal: ""You can't move your bitcoin to your own personal wallet or send it to anybody else. You can't transfer it to a crypto-exchange to use it for trading other cryptocurrencies, Goodman notes. ""There are also relatively large fees"" for transactions, ranging from 1.5% to 2.3%, depending on the amount you buy or sell.

PayPal isn't the only mainstream app cashing in on the crypto craze. The popular investment app Robinhood is also dealing in the currency now, and it doesn't charge any commission.

Square's Cash App is another platform that includes bitcoin trading, while Swan Bitcoin is an app that lets users automatically invest in the cryptocurrency at regular intervals. Square does usually charge service and volatility fees for bitcoin transactions (although it doesn't explicitly state what these are on its website), while Swan Bitcoin charges from 0.99% to 2.29% as a percentage of the weekly amount saved.

Cryptocurrency exchanges

One of the main ways investors purchase bitcoin is through cryptocurrency exchanges. Since this option involves directly buying bitcoin yourself on a dedicated cryptocurrency exchange, it's recommended for more experienced investors. These have certain advantages over the apps and funds, such as:

Lower fees in the range of 0.10% to 0.26%

in the range of 0.10% to 0.26% The ability to withdraw bitcoins and download them to another account. This is considered essential by many experienced bitcoin traders, given that various high-profile cryptocurrency exchanges have suffered hacks over the years. (Some apps do allow it, but popular ones like Robinhood and PayPal are not among them.)

As mentioned, this is a more sophisticated game — you're getting into the professional traders' territory. Still, ""if you're a more advanced user, then you can probably handle buying on an exchange yourself,"" says Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain tech firm Blockstream. ""Bitstamp or Kraken are reliable platforms"" that he recommends for individual investors.

Other reputable exchanges operating in the US include Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini.

To start trading, you'll have to open an account with the exchange. These exchanges follow stringent know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines, so you will need to prove your identity before being able to trade using them. Most exchanges have minimum deposit requirements for fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, but these are usually very low.

What to know before investing in bitcoin

Despite being over a decade old, bitcoin remains a relatively immature asset. There's less trading volume on its markets, which means it's less liquid, and the price changes can be volatile. It's therefore hard to predict how it will behave from one month to the next.

Here are some tips for reducing your exposure to risk while also increasing your exposure to potential gain.

Keep it safe and secure: Crypto-exchanges still continue to suffer the occasional hack even today. Since bitcoins do not exist in physical form, seasoned bitcoin investors store them in digital wallets. A hardware wallet is a handheld, offline device that securely stores the private key necessary to transfer your bitcoin holdings from one place to another. Ledger and Trezor are two reputable brands.

""If the amount you store is going to be a lot, you may also want to add a seed backup,"" advises Mow. A ""seed backup"" is a backup of the phrase (i.e. a set of words) that lets you access your bitcoin wallet. Many investors holding large quantities of bitcoin engrave their seed phrases onto metal plates and then store these plates somewhere safe (such as a bank deposit vault).

Likewise, you should plan on doing all of your investing from a secure internet connection. In general, trading or buying bitcoin on a public WiFi network makes you more susceptible to attacks from hackers.

Start small, rather than big: Given its short history and still highly unpredictable behavior, it's usually wise to keep your initial investment in Bitcoin relatively limited. Even experienced investors (e.g. hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones) have allocated just a single-digit percentage of their capital to bitcoin while keeping the rest in less volatile assets. And, despite the hype and forecasts, maintain your investment discipline, buying only what you can afford to potentially lose and not getting swept up by promises of gigantic upswings.

Bear taxes in mind: Even though it's a currency, the IRS considers bitcoin to be property rather than money, so it's subject to the same tax treatment as other investment assets. Bitcoin taxes can be triggered by trading, exchanging, or simply spending the cryptocurrency (if it's increased in value since you bought it). So documenting every transaction is essential. The good news is that bitcoin profits are taxed at the special capital gains tax rate, which is often less than ordinary income rates.

Have a buy-and-hold mentality: Unless you're prepared to watch the market daily and move at a moment's notice, investing in bitcoin should really be undertaken for the long term. ""Bitcoin's heightened day-to-day volatility makes this especially true,"" says Ari Wald.

In other words, it's not really advisable to buy bitcoin expecting to sell it a day, week, or month later, as investors found when the cryptocurrency tanked by 50% in two days in March. However, the fact that bitcoin recovered following this crash to hit a new all-time high in November and then December shows the virtue of patience.

The financial takeaway

The investment outlook for bitcoin is bright. It had an exciting 2020, with a growing number of corporate investors beginning to snap up the cryptocurrency (a big part of the reason why it has risen in price by 170% since 2019).

And with more institutional investors buying bitcoin every month, and the cryptocurrency's relative supply shrinking, most analysts seem to think it still has space to rise higher.

Not only has the future never looked better for bitcoin, but it has never been easier to buy and invest in the cryptocurrency. From payment apps to bitcoin funds to crypto-exchanges, there are now a multitude of options for anyone wanting to gain exposure to the original all-digital asset.

Back then, the stock was trading at around $0.35 a share. At the time of this writing, the stock is trading at about $1.30 a share. That is a pretty significant return in about half a year.

When I wrote about this company in May, I mentioned that it was risky. I still feel it is risky — perhaps more so now than it was earlier in the year. Sharp price rises tend to make everything less appealing. With HIVE flying upwards, is it a good idea to buy shares today?

I’m still holding at these levels

HIVE is very much reliant on Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance. At the moment, Bitcoin is hovering around its all-time high. Should the cryptocurrency rocket higher, you could be reasonably assured that the mining company will follow it upwards. If you believe that cryptocurrencies are going to continue moving upwards, this is a leveraged way to participate in further price movement.

Cryptocurrencies could potentially move significantly in the future. Institutional investors are beginning to move into the new sector. This interest could drive prices higher as more investors chase an ever-shrinking supply of Bitcoin. The market is still tiny. Even today, it is less than US$500 billion. This means any significant increase in interest could drive up coin values considerably. HIVE is a way to participate without needing to buy cryptocurrencies.

Operations

The company currently has a fair amount of cash and crypto on hand. As of September 2020, the company had US$5.1 million in cash and US$9.7 million in receivables and prepaids. It also has US$3.5 in digital currencies. I would assume that the digital currency part of its balance sheet would be considerably higher now given the fact that Bitcoin has practically doubled.

Its operations are entirely funded through the sale of mined coins. This strategy makes HIVE a solid potential money maker. The majority of its revenues come from the two top coins. Both of these coins are having excellent runs this year, adding to the company’s revenues.

Aside from its Canadian operations, HIVE also has mining units in other, cooler parts of the world. These include 100%-owned operations in Iceland and Sweden. The operations in all three jurisdictions are also powered by renewable energy sources such as hydroelectricity and geothermal power. The environmentally responsible operations negate one of the major criticisms of cryptocurrencies. Extensive power consumption is not as big an issue.

The bottom line

I am very bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a publicly listed company, HIVE has the potential to be a major player in the sector. Its geographically diversified locations give the company access to clean, low-cost energy.

Owning this company is one way to gain access to this sector. Crypto investments could help diversify your portfolio against excessive money-printing globally. I believe that investing in cryptocurrency efforts, in addition to gold and silver, might be the best way to profit from a significant fall in fiat currencies going forward.",2020-12-19 00:00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/crypto-fomo-makes-even-a-350-premium-on-bitcoin-look-appealing,"Why did this happen?

The digital asset exchange notes that DeFi tokens are still lagging behind BTC as the pseudonymous cryptocurrency reached all-time highs at around $23,800. While Bitcoin is up 25% in the past week, DeFi assets like AAVE and Yearn.Finance (YFI) are “only” up by around 10%, OKCoin confirmed in its latest report.

During the last week, leading decentralized protocols and DeFi technology platforms announced updates as Ethereum gained a major institutional supporter. Analysts are now expecting these developments to further drive or promote “macro” growth in the DeFi space, even if there’s consolidation in leading DeFi protocols such as Yearn.Finance’s YFI, Compound’s COMP, and Uniswap’s UNI in the near-term, the report noted.

As stated in the report:

“Analysts think this underperformance is a result of the magnitude of BTC’s rally and potential regulations that could affect DeFi. … the fundamentals of the space moved forward this week with notable developments regarding a leading Ethereum scaling solution, Optimism, and new products from top apps.”

The report also mentioned:

“OKCoin launched Earn, a tool that provides easy access to DeFi protocols, with up to 20% APY on stablecoin holdings (offer is subject to certain terms and conditions). CME Group will be launching ethereum futures in February 2021. Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal commented that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization in the upcoming bull cycle.”

According to industry experts, when BTC “rallies quickly, it can suck the air out of altcoins” (or all coins besides Bitcoin). The report pointed out that this trend was observed during early October and November 2020, where there were some alternative coins that lost value against the USD as Bitcoin surged to $12,000, and then past $14,000 (and beyond). This is also “a phenomenon that has been seen in previous bull markets,” the report from OKCoin confirmed.

Altcoins are now “expected to outperform if Bitcoin enters a period of consolidation,” the report noted. The OKCoin team explained that “the theory goes that once Bitcoin begins to consolidate, investors look to related investments that can outperform.” There are also “some fears that regulation from the US could suppress DeFi,” the report added.

The report pointed out:

“There have been rumors circling regarding potential legislation from the US Treasury that will require virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to report all withdrawals to [self-custodied crypto] wallets. … there’ve [also] been moves made to crack down on the presence of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market due to fears that these assets are acting as fuel for the shadow economy.”

The report continued:

“There are concerns that these moves may result in further pressure on decentralized finance applications, which require users to have custody of their own funds (often stablecoins) to operate correctly. Prominent fund managers and traders in the space have argued that since DeFi tokens are actually entitlements to cash flows to some extent and carry a governance premium, it can be argued that they should move differently than tokens that don’t provide a cash flow like BTC.”

While sharing other crypto market updates, the report noted that Polkadot, the second-fastest-growing smart contract blockchain platform after Ethereum, will soon “garner the support of SushiSwap” (a decentralized or non-custodial crypto token exchange).

SushiSwap’s co-founder, “0xMaki,” recently revealed that the exchange would soon “open” on Polkadot.

He noted:

“If you LP’ed past end September you still have 2/3 of your rewards that will be available in 6mo. and you will receive moonSushi when we open on Polkadot.”

According to OKCoin’s report, this seems to be “the first ‘Crypto Twitter’ has heard of SushiSwap’s intention to go cross-chain.” The report added that “there’s a good reason why SushiSwap is pursuing Polkadot, though.” It noted that Electric Capital, a developer-focused venture fund, has released a report “highlighting that Polkadot has a vibrant developer base only second to Ethereum.” The report also mentioned that the network “purportedly has more transactions now than Ethereum did at the same point in its life.”",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/trump-rushes-new-crypto-bill/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways U.S. FinCEN released details of the rumored law for compulsory KYC/AML for self-hosted crypto wallets.

According to the proposal, crypto businesses will have to record and KYC all transactions above $3,000, and submit a currency transaction report (CTR) for transactions above $10,000.

Experts find the bill impractical and suggest “midnight rulemaking” from the outgoing Trump administration.

Share this article

U.S. regulators finally issued a formal notice for KYC/AML registration of self-hosted crypto wallets, the rumors of which have been doing the rounds since last month.

While the crypto bill is no different than the existing banking regulations, the speed of its implementation is raising concerns around discriminative treatment.

Surveillance Bill on Crypto Wallets

On Dec. 18, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new legislation, extending KYC/AML requirements from cryptocurrency businesses to self custody storage.

These include independent nodes like the BTCPay server and crypto wallets like MetaMask, Electrum, and others.

The bill titled, “The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposes Rule Aimed at Closing Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Gaps for Certain Convertible Virtual Currency and Digital Asset Transactions,” focuses on the apparent “gaps” in the reporting of crypto transactions.

The state agency will be taking public comments on the proposal for the next fifteen days.

The U.S. Treasury Department which heads FinCEN, sees “anonymous” crypto wallets as “loopholes that malign actors may exploit.”

The current Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires banks and other money service businesses, including cryptocurrencies—to record individuals’ names and physical addresses for any transaction above $3,000.

Further, it requires the exchanges or banks to file a currency transaction report (CTR) for all transactions above $10,000. Steven Mnuchin, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, noted:

“The rule, which applies to financial institutions and is consistent with existing requirements, is intended to protect national security, assist law enforcement, and increase transparency while minimizing the impact on responsible innovation.”

Indeed, the law is the same for banking institutions.

However, the outgoing Trump administration is rushing proceedings without clear due diligence, showcasing considerable intolerance towards the industry.

“Midnight Rulemaking”

Regulators claim a neutral stance by highlighting equal treatment to the banking industry. However, experts say that they couldn’t be more ignorant.

First, the 15-day deadline.

Any formal notice of this nature, called an NPRM, requires a 30- to- 60-day incubation period for taking public comments. However, in this case, the regulators are fast-tracking the ruling. A lot of it has to do with the fact that Biden’s administration will take over after the above period.

This borders on passing an interim formal rule altogether. The general counsel for Compound Finance, Jake Cherbinsky, said that regulators are supposed to grant at least 60 days’ notice for “significant” laws.

15/ Regular order calls for an agency to accept public comment for at least 60 days for ""significant"" rules. It can be longer. FinCEN is giving us 15. At the end of December. With one month left before a new president is sworn in. There's a name for this: ""midnight rulemaking."" — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) December 19, 2020

Congress and crypto industry leaders have already raised opposition to the bill, but regulators are moving ahead with complete disregard.

Second, its significance on privacy and freedom.

It threatens to infiltrate the privacy and security features of cryptocurrencies, making them no different than banks. Peter Van Valkenburgh, from CoinCenter, wrote in a blog post:

“Make no mistake, [Currency Transaction Reports] are a form of warrantless search and seizure of private financial records.”

Moreover, the rule is impractical and just as easy to bypass.

If an individual moves crypto from one wallet to another, how are these decentralized services or wallets supposed to submit records to the regulators?

The market was mostly unaffected by the news as BTC continued to trade above $23,000 following the state agency’s press release. Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investment, said:

“When the price [of Bitcoin] reacts opposite to the expectation prior to the news, the trend in the ensuing direction is usually violently enhanced. Bullish [Bitcoin].”

However, the law may still hurt the industry.

It is going to make operations difficult for crypto exchanges in terms of administration and recordkeeping. It may also introduce blanket bans and restrictions on many DeFi applications or independent nodes to comply with uninformed regulations.

Many critical features of the crypto space will need to make necessary changes, and not all of them will push the industry forward.

Share this article",2020-12-19 14:28:51+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/19/why-i-invested-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,"At the outset, everyone should understand that cryptocurrencies fundamentally differ from stocks. Stocks have intrinsic value -- they represent a real piece of a physical business. In the short term, stocks can swing up and down for no apparent reason, but long-term, as a company's intrinsic value increases or decreases, the stock tends to move in the same direction. By contrast, cryptocurrencies have zero intrinsic value -- they're just computer code. That makes future token prices hard to predict.

However, I believe there's a fundamental economic principle we can use to our advantage. It's the principle I used when deciding to buy bitcoin and Ether (the tokens for the Ethereum network) in 2018. And it's the same principle anyone can use to today to guide their thinking about any cryptocurrency investment.

Supply and demand

In economics, few principles are as basic as the law of supply and demand. Price is determined by how much of something is available (supply) and how much people want or need it (demand). When it comes to cryptocurrencies, supply differs in each case. Bitcoin's supply is well-known, and bitcoin aficionados argue this proves its future value.

However, supply is only half of the equation. Remember Beanie Babies? Ty, the company that made them, periodically ""retired"" certain Beanie Babies, limiting their supply forever. This limited supply motivated some collectors to buy the toys hand over fist, causing their value to soar in the '90s. Some even fetched thousands of dollars. However, Beanie Babies prices quickly plummeted after their brief heyday -- most still sell for a fraction of what they sold for in the '90s. But supply hasn't changed; they still don't make the discontinued ones. Demand changed. People don't want them as much anymore, so they're worth less.

Many cryptocurrencies have known supplies. That's extremely useful. But an educated opinion of future token value requires a prediction for future demand. Thinking through both supply and demand led me to buy an equal amount of bitcoin and Ether over the thousands of other options. In my opinion, they're the two most likely cryptocurrency candidates to be in demand going forward and the ones I would buy today (but more on that in a bit).

Why I bought Ether

I bought Ether because the Ethereum blockchain has real-world utility. While tokens can be used for digital payments, more practical things like smart contracts and applications can be built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Think of it like a tank of gas. Sure, the tank of gas has value. But it also has a practical use. Continuing this analogy, some cryptocurrencies are just tanks of gas in engine-less worlds. But Ethereum's blockchain is a gas-powered engine.

Ethereum isn't the only blockchain network like this, but it's arguably the best known. That's important because blockchain networks benefit from a network effect. In other words, the more people use one system, the more likely it is more people will use the system. To me, if people were going to build upon existing blockchain technology, Ethereum is surely among the top candidates.

Many businesses already see the value of using blockchain technology. And some, like DocuSign, are already building upon the Ethereum blockchain. To execute a transaction on the blockchain, you're charged a fee in Ether. As more real-world applications are powered by the Ethereum blockchain, there will likely be an increasing demand for Ether to make it run. This could keep sending its value higher -- its value is already up about 350% in 2020.

Why I bought bitcoin

Bitcoin has less utility than Ethereum, but that hasn't stopped it from maintaining its title as the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Some believe it could become a one-world currency, creating extremely high demand. But to me, that sounds far-fetched. People don't seem to be using bitcoin for transactions but rather as a growth investment or as a digital store of value.

In my opinion, bitcoin's demand as a store of value is far less than what it would be as a currency or some other everyday utility. That said, bitcoin's upside could still be great given its supply is far more limited than that of Ether. Consider there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin tokens. By contrast, Ether and many others have no ultimate ceiling. Ether has annual mining limits, which keeps new supply somewhat in check. But bitcoin's mining process is even more limited.

Every time there's a transaction on the bitcoin network, decentralized computers process it and the fastest computer is rewarded with new bitcoin tokens. However, every few years the bitcoin reward is cut in half, most recently in May. This means miners are rewarded with 6.25 bitcoin tokens right now, as opposed to 12.5 earlier in the year.

Because there's less bitcoin coming into circulation now, the price of bitcoin could go up if demand remains constant. A surprising development this year is new demand is suddenly pouring in from corporate entities. For example, Square just bought over 4,700 bitcoin tokens. And growing corporate demand, coupled with the new supply being cut in half, has helped drive the price of bitcoin higher in 2020 -- up over 160% year to date.

What to do

After considering the issue of supply and demand, here's my cryptocurrency investing thesis: Both bitcoin and Ether have high chances of being used in the future. And their supplies are limited enough to send the value of these tokens higher as demand surges. I believe that applies as much today as it did when I bought bitcoin and Ether in 2018.

When I bought, I committed to holding for at least five years. I made that commitment because, with two very speculative investments, I recognize this will likely be a volatile ride and I want to ensure I've given enough time for my thesis to play out. However, because this is speculative, I recognize the value of cryptocurrencies could plummet to zero. Accordingly, I only invested a small amount. And even though it appears my thesis is playing out, I won't consider adding more even as prices rise. Since cryptocurrencies don't have intrinsic value, the risk is simply too asymmetric for me.

If you like the promise of cryptocurrency but don't want the outsized risk, there are other ways to invest in the trend. Specifically, there are stocks benefiting from blockchain technology. This allows you to purchase shares in real businesses generating real revenue from cryptocurrencies, rather than speculating on things outside of your control.",2020-12-19 00:00:00,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-market-cap-could-hit-1-trillion-2021-crypto-expert-2020-12,"REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Bitcoin's market cap could hit a trillion dollars as early as 2021, according to Blockchain.com's head of research.

""My expectation is that bitcoin will become a trillion dollar asset as early as next year,"" Garrick Hileman, who is also a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, told Business Insider.

Although the 2020 bitcoin rally was largely driven by institutional investors, he expects to see continued buy-in more from retail and Wall Street investors going forward.

The researcher expects the US to digitize the dollar, but not too soon as he said ""the Fed is happy with the way the world is.""

Bitcoin's market cap could reach $1 trillion sometime in 2021 as investors take its reserve currency status more seriously, according to Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com.

Major institutional players like Stanley Druckenmiller, BlackRock, Bill Miller, and Jack Dorsey have acknowledged that bitcoin is not only going away, but is becoming a reserve asset and validating the digital gold thesis, Hileman said.

Bitcoin has a current market cap of about $350 billion, while that of gold's stands at roughly $10 trillion. This week the cryptocurrency gained 12% over two days alone, and was trading at $22,994 on Saturday.

""My expectation is that bitcoin will become a trillion dollar asset as early as next year,"" the crypto researcher told Business Insider.

Blockchain.com observed a 39% growth in wallet creation year-to-date on its crypto exchange. That is about 17 million wallets created since December 2019.

The exchange saw a broadening of adoption and ownership of crypto assets this year as more people continued to want in on acquiring the token. As many as 100 million people own crypto assets today, according to Hileman.

He noticed a lot of the recent price action was driven by institutional investors, based on transactions that occur on the chain, and is unlike the retail investor frenzy of 2017. On-chain demand and other metrics suggest that the 2020 rally was driven more by institutional hedge funds, family offices, and money managers.

Hileman expects to see continued buy-in from retail and Wall Street investors going forward, rather than corporates. That's because it is harder for bigger players to participate than professional investors who already have accounts and easy access to major exchanges, he explained.

For bitcoin's market cap to reach $1 trillion, it would have to hit a price of $54,000 per coin next year - a 130% rally from where it's at.

As for the US dollar, the researcher expects the world's most popular reserve currency to be digitized sometime in the next five years. ""At this point, the Fed is still taking its time because the Fed is happy with the way the world is,"" he said.

The status quo is working well for the dollar because it is dominant through the SWIFT mechanism and the corresponding banking system, he said. The US government can also raise debt at attractive interest rates, supporting the dollar's status. But a competitive challenge lies in the crypto space and in the rise of stablecoins.

American Express says its venture arm, Amex Ventures has invested in Falconx the cryptocurrency trading platform that focuses on serving institutional trading clients. Amex’s investment, which was announced during a record-breaking week for bitcoin, underscores the credit card issuer’s desire to cash in on the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.

Amex Venture’s Long Term Interest in Cryptos

According to a report, Amex Ventures’ acquisition of a stake in Falconx is the culmination of an investigation into cryptocurrencies that took an unknown number of years. In comments made following the announcement, Harshul Sanghi, the global head of Amex briefly explains the rationale behind the financial services giant’s interest in crypto startups. He says:

Amex Ventures invests in startups as a way to better understand emerging areas of the payments ecosystem.

Meanwhile, before the investment by Amex for an undisclosed amount, the crypto start-up had reportedly raised $17 million in May “from the likes of Accel, Coinbase Ventures and a fund affiliated with Fidelity Investments’ parent company.” Since then, Falconx is reporting that its revenues have grown substantially and the platform now handles “around $3 billion in transaction volume monthly and has 250 institutional clients.”

Meanwhile, the same report quotes Raghu Yarlagadda, Falconx’s chief executive and co-founder who claims that the start-up is seeing an “increasing number of traditional service providers and hedge funds have become interested in cryptocurrencies.” The reported interest by the latter is believed to be the key driver of the current crypto market bull run.

Institutional Growth

As reported by News.bitcoin.com, BTC touched a new all-time high of $23,777 on December 17 less than 24 hours after breaching the $20,000 mark. With many bitcoiners now expecting the BTC price to continue surging having passed its previous resistance level, more institutional investors are expected to join in the crypto buying and holding frenzy.

In the meantime, as this is happening, Yarlagadda remarks that Falconx will be “at the front and center of seeing this institutional growth.”

Cryptocurrency is all about better currency; that is good money. Everyone in cryptocurrency is there to make money….not everyone makes it though!

Like sharks in deep oceans are scammers who’ve flooded the crypto space. They are among the top earners in the field. Meanwhile, criminals just made USD 4.4 billion in 2019 alone. All this, just sitting in their houses and playing tricks with the internet…thanks to cryptocurrency!

That said, scammers will only become better…it’s a mind game!

Such kinds of high-level scams, though shakes, have never crippled the industry. Cryptocurrency only gets better against all odds, and experts’ projections only reveal a brighter world ahead. A clear indication that the industry is firm and worth investing in.

As you can see, handsome money exists in the crypto space. It only takes learning several tricks and directs the stream to your pocket. This article shows how you can make genuine money with cryptocurrency.

So, how can you make genuine money with cryptocurrency?

1. BUY & HODL

Buy and HODL (Hold on for Dear Life), is a phrase used in the cryptocurrency community for purchasing the cryptocurrency and holding it with a hope that the coin will one day sell at a higher price.

HODL is one of the easiest and fast ways to make money with cryptocurrency. Here you just learn how to buy and wait with patience before selling. Simply put, this is how you make money through this method.

In 2017, bitcoin price grew from $974 to $20000 in less than a year. In other words, anyone who bought bitcoin in January 2017 and sold it in December the same year grew his money by a whopping 2000%…in just

one year!

One week in July 2010 saw bitcoin grow from $0.008 to $0.08 in five days. This was a 1000% growth in a record 5 days.

This method is also highly applicable in other cryptocurrencies including Etherium, Binance, Nexo, monera, and all others that have a fundamental use-case.

2. Cryptocurrency dividends

This is another easy and great way to make money in the crypto world. In buy and hodl, you only make money when you sell your coin at a higher price than you bought it. Some cryptocurrencies, however, have a good way of rewarding traders…crypto dividends!

With coins like Neo, Neblio, KuCoin, CEFF, etc, traders make money by simply holding the coin in your account. This way you don’t need to purchase or own cryptocurrency…you get paid for simply holding and keeping the currency in circulation!

Neblio, for example, which is seen as a competitor of Etherium and NEO gives an annual return of 10% on the total holdings. Dividends are earned on holding the Nebl token on neblio qt and/or a raspberry pi.

3. Cryptocurrency staking

Staking is a process of holding coins in a live cryptocurrency wallet. It combines the earning potential of buy and hodl and those of cryptocurrency dividends.

In staking you buy a currency and hold it while waiting to sell it in the future at a better price. The cryptocurrency then pays you dividends for the period you hold the currency in a form well known as “double profit.”

Cryptos that use this system pays you for securing their crypto network. These cryptocurrencies include: PIVX, Navcoin, and decreed. This is the smartest way to make money in cryptocurrency with fewer efforts.

4. Cryptocurrency Masternode

Cryptocurrency is built on blockchain technology. In other words, cryptocurrency is a digital ledger where transactions are recorded in real-time and chronologically then put public for verification.

These operations need a masternode. A masternode is a computer that makes the ledger available, and up to date in real-time. A masternode acts like a server that can be hosted on any computer…including yours!

Hosting a masternode, however, has some requirements. For many cryptocurrencies, you are required to have a certain number of coins in your account. This number ranges from 1000 to 2500 depending on the cryptocurrency you invest in.

In this case, you get paid to maintain a real-time record of the transactions on the cryptocurrency network. This process requires some technical skills, hence good for advanced users.

Masternode is considered the consensus method for proof of stake currencies. For example, DASH requires 1000 coins to create a node with approximately 7% annual ROI.

5. Cryptocurrency Mining

You probably have come across all these pop-ups suggesting to show you how to mine bitcoins. Mining is one of the surest ways to make money in cryptocurrency especially when talking of altcoins.

Mining involves adding transaction records to a chain of public ledger transactions. The process requires high computing power if it has to be profitable. For this reason, mining requires that you invest largely in equipment; buying, setting up and maintenance.

Complex work in this process is done by the computer. You just set it and let it solve the complex mathematical problems. The miner is rewarded for every problem solved successfully. As pointed earlier, however, this requires a powerful processor that will outdo other computers in the pool to solve as many problems as possible.

For example, this is how you can make money mining bitcoin.

bitcoin mining is measured in units called ‘blocks’. For every block completed, the miner currently receives 12.5 bitcoin as a reward.



6. Day trading

This is one of the most common ways to make money in the crypto-sphere. It involves tracking the prices of currencies while constantly buying and selling them. This one is surely not for beginners or those trying the depths. It takes advanced analytical and technical skills to earn good money.

While 80% of cryptocurrency investors believe that day trading is the only way to make money in cryptocurrency, statistics show another side of it.

For example, according to cointelegraph, 80% of day traders quit within the first two years. Additionally, active traders under perform by 6.5% annually, adds cointelegraph.

That notwithstanding, the report found that traders with up to a 10 years negative track record continue to trade. Perhaps why another report reveals that 90% of day traders are losing money silently.

These statistics are scary if not horrific. In other news, however, some guys are making money through this method and others believe that it’s the only way to make money with cryptocurrencies. True to it, with proper tools and skills, this is, without doubt, the most rewarding way of making money with cryptocurrency.

Final thoughts

The cryptocurrency industry is evolving rapidly. A few years have passed since it became a thing. Through the years, crypto turned many to millionaires and drained others of their millions. Yes, you can make smart money with cryptocurrency. How much... It depends!

It all depends on your management skills and how high you are willing to take your crypto trading skills.

New infected Rubygems packages have been spotted in its open-source software repository and which contained malicious code mainly used to steal cryptocurrencies from users via supply chain attack.

Two Cryptocurrency-Stealers Rubygems Detected by Researchers at Sonatype

According to Ax Sharma, a security researcher at Sonatype, the two gems detected — pretty_color and ruby-bitcoin — had malware that deployed the attack on Windows machines and replaced any bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), or monero (XMR) wallet addresses found on the victim’s clipboard by the attackers’ ones.

Rubygems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that allows developers to integrate code developed by other people. Anyone can upload a “gem” to the repository, open in some way the doors for threat actors to upload their malicious packages.

The researcher explained further about how the attack operates:

This means if a user who had mistakenly installed either of these gems was to copy-paste a bitcoin recipient wallet address somewhere on their system, the address would be replaced with that of the attacker, who’d now receive the bitcoins.

During an analysis conducted by the Sonatype Security Research team, it was detected that unless the victim double-checks the wallet address after they paste it, the clipboard hijacker deployed during the supply chain attack will quietly change the address by creating separate malicious scripts contained in VBS files.

Supply Chain Attacks: A Growing Concern

Sharma also warned on the growing trend that supply chain attacks have so far in 2020, considering it a “bigger concern.”

According to Sonatype’s 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain report, there was a 430% increase in upstream software supply chain attacks over the past year, making it “virtually impossible” to chase and keep track of such components manually.

Sonatype’s Sharma adds:

Of all activities a ransomware group may conduct on a compromised system, replacing bitcoin wallet address on the clipboard feels more akin to a trivial mischief by an amateur threat actor than to a sophisticated ransomware operation. However, this coincidence does raise a bigger concern, considering how rampant software supply chain attacks have been in 2020.

Will we see a leading role in crypto-related supply chain attacks in 2021? Let us know in the comments section below.

Michael Saylor, chief executive officer of MicroStrategy Inc, in a tweet to Musk, suggested that the billionaire Tesla founder and head, make the move.

“If you want to do your shareholders a $100 billion favor, convert the $TSLA balance sheet from USD to #BTC,” Saylor wrote in his tweet. “Other firms on the S&P 500 would follow your lead & in time it would grow to become a $1 trillion favor.”

“Are such large transactions even possible?” Musk replied to Saylor.

“Yes. I have purchased over $1.3 billion in #BTC in past months & would be happy to share my playbook with you offline....,” Saylor tweeted.

Tesla and Musk could not be reached for comment.

“Every CEO faces the challenge of how to preserve & enhance shareholder value in the face of this year’s unprecedented monetary expansion,” Saylor said in a message to Reuters.

“Bitcoin is the best solution to the store of value problem faced by every individual, investor, & corporation on earth,” Saylor said.

Shares of Tesla rose to a record high on Friday in a frantic day of trading as investors geared up for the electric carmaker’s much anticipated entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday.

Bitcoin rose to a high of $24,299.75 on Sunday, after passing the $20,000 milestone for the first time last week, amid surging interest from larger investors.

As mentioned in an update shared with Crowdfund Insider, conducted annually, the Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) is a nationwide survey offering a benchmark for “the awareness, trust and confidence” that Australians have in virtual currencies. Bitcoin or BTC remains “the best known” cryptocurrency, with 88.8% of the nation’s residents confirming that they’re (at least) “aware of it.”

As noted in the update:

“According to the IRCI, 78.2% of the survey respondents who did own crypto in 2020 said they were breaking even or better, with only 21.8% reporting a loss. The 45 – 54 age bracket were the most likely to have made money, with more than half in the black. This was a strong improvement on last year, where only 35% of their age group increased their wealth through crypto.”

Adrian Przelozny, CEO of Independent Reserve, the Australian digital asset exchange that initiated the inaugural IRCI in 2019, said that they’re seeing significantly more traditional and institutional investors “look to Bitcoin as a growth strategy.” Przelozny added that “it marries with the attitudinal shift they’ve seen across the Australian population as now almost two in five people view bitcoin as a store of value or an investment vehicle.”

As crypto moves into the mainstream, Australian residents will be “more inclined to trust it,” according to the update. In 2020, only 17.3% of survey respondents said they’ve considered Bitcoin to be a “scam,” which is down considerably from 21.3% last year. These numbers seem to reflect a “broader acceptance of the technology by the general public.” It’s also indicative of “shifting perceptions,” with 19.1% Australians noting that they now “view Bitcoin as a store of value, up from 16.7% in 2019.”

As confirmed in the update:

“Of those who had intended to buy crypto in 2020 but didn’t, more than a third said their purchasing decisions were directly impacted due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis.”

Przelozny claims that if it weren’t for the “sobering” effects of the Coronavirus crisis, and the downturn affecting trader and investor appetite to get into the market, then “it’s easy to imagine how the price of Bitcoin could have soared even higher this year.” He also mentioned that the IRCI 2020 reveals that considerably more Australian residents are “gaining confidence in crypto.”

As noted in the update:

“Beyond the dominant crypto, twice as many men than women knew of other coins such as Ethereum (ETH), [XRP], Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS and Litecoin (LTC).”

Millennials or younger investors were almost twice as likely than the general population to be “informed about newer cryptos,” like Chainlink (LINK), a digital token that has become increasingly popular because of this year’s trend toward decentralized finance (DeFi).

The first was the policy response to the global pandemic, specifically from the US government, Novogratz said. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, loaned over $1.5 trillion to banks and financial institutions, and increased its purchases of US treasury securities in an effort to stabilize the economy when the pandemic struck.

Novogratz added that ""there could not be a better macro story,"" for owning bitcoin right now.

The second trend that propelled cryptocurrencies? The expansion of digital life that may lead to more investors to feel comfortable using a digital wallet.

Earlier this month, former crypto skeptic and Bernstein Research's co-head of portfolio strategy Inigo Fraser-Jenkins told clients that the pandemic has changed the policy environment, debt levels, and diversification options for investors and made bitcoin an attractive asset.

Most of us (myself included) are failing. And that in itself is an intriguing narrative, that sheds light on bitcoin’s rally.

Bear with me while I try to explain.

On the one hand, we have a rapid rise in the bitcoin price, and coalescing institutional support from traditional investors and companies that see potential in crypto assets and markets.

Related: First Mover: As Markets Turn Ugly, Bitcoiners Thank Secular Trend

On the other hand, we have conflicting economic and social trends. We have blind faith in the power of vaccines combined with rejection of the science of virus transmission; monetary policy designed to encourage lending combined with banks that are unwilling to do so; growing interest in the value of emerging markets combined with escalating risk of default; widening inequality combined with greater power of protest; I could go on.

These conflicting forces and the uncertainty swirling around them should encourage us to look closely at prevailing narratives. Yet, those of us watching the growing institutional interest in bitcoin markets have accepted without question the assumption that bitcoin’s inflation hedge qualities are behind it.

Let’s pick that apart.

The deflation debate

First, let’s look at another pair of conflicting economic trends.

Related: Blockchain Bites: The Fight for Private, Digital Cash

Most economists seem to believe that a resurgence of inflation is unlikely. Depressed consumption and excess supply, the continuing impact of technology and demographic shifts, the low velocity of money and the weak labor market are just some of the factors they point to. These have already led to deflation in some key economic areas.

The bond market, on the other hand, tells us that inflation concerns are real. The five-year breakeven rate, a proxy for inflation expectations calculated by taking the difference between five-year U.S. Treasurys and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, is close to its five-year high.

Story continues

What’s more, the yield curve continues to steepen, signaling expectations of higher interest rates in the future as central banks tackle a looming inflation problem. Taking into account the damage rising interest rates would do to debt-laden economies, this is the bond market telling us that they see trouble ahead.

An inflation hedge

But does that really matter for bitcoin?

Bitcoin is seen as an inflation hedge mainly because of its limited supply, which is not influenced by its price, and because of its relative attractiveness when real yields head to zero or lower.

Yet, when you buy bitcoin, you’re not just doing so to hedge inflation. You’re buying bitcoin to hedge all the other negative consequences that usually accompany it.

True, inflation is not always bad. “Good” inflation, a result of economic growth and low unemployment that helps to close the gap between supply and demand, encourages investment and even more economic growth.

Runaway inflation, however, exacerbates poverty, heightens uncertainty, demolishes trust in institutions and can lead to the breakdown of social order. This is not isolated to post-WWI Germany – we see it today in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Lebanon and Argentina, to name just a few.

Bitcoin is also a hedge for unstable governments that close bank accounts, police states that want to seize private wealth, broken payments rails due to corrupted systems or outside cyber attack threats, paranoid leaders that want to disenfranchise opponents, export-protecting devaluations that trigger more inflation.

These are less likely in developed economies. But let’s not forget that tipping points lurk around unexpected corners, and that Venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world and one of the more stable democracies in Latin America.

Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, but also against political instability and social disruption, which – if inflation comes roaring back – is not a ridiculous thing to prepare for.

A dollar debasement hedge

Bitcoin is also a hedge against a more gentle but just as pernicious debasement of currency through a loss of trust.

Traditionally, inflation moves in tandem with the strength of the local economy. But it can be triggered by currency weakness, which raises the prices of imported goods.

This is usually corrected when the central bank raises interest rates to combat rising inflation, which increases the attractiveness of the currency compared to others.

But in the current environment, an increase in interest rates may have the opposite effect, given the potentially catastrophic impact on debt-ridden economies. The U.S. bond market is telling us that it thinks interest rates will rise. The dollar continues to head lower, however, and could continue to do so even if those rate increases materialize, as faith in the capacity of the U.S. to employ traditional tools to good effect could be shaken.

And, most bitcoin trading is denominated in dollars. Therefore, if the dollar heads lower without a corresponding fall in the value of bitcoin (and since it’s unrelated to the economy, there’s no fundamental reason why it would), the BTC/USD ratio heads up.

Bitcoin is a hedge for not just the macroeconomic ills that we have been trained to watch out for. It can also provide ballast against the unforeseen problems waiting to be triggered.

The ‘crazy’ thesis

This highlights another hidden strength of bitcoin as an investment asset.

It is unlike any asset that we have seen before: programmatic supply, decentralized governance, fragmented market infrastructure that runs on technology developed by an unknown entity yet maintained by miners, developers and validators distributed across many geographies.

It doesn’t fit into standard economic thinking – and for that reason, it is perfect for our times.

In a world where you’ve gone from orthodox monetary policy to Keynesian economics to MMT in a few months, there is no longer any trust in the traditional recipes.

To paraphrase G. K. Chesterton, when you stop believing in traditional recipes, your mind is more open to new ones.

Bitcoin in portfolios represents more than a new recipe. It represents the need for a new recipe. It represents a safety play against a world in which old ideas are up in the air, and new ones have yet to take root.

It represents more than a hedge against inflation: it also represents an acceptance that politics and economics can get weird, and that untested ideas that are untethered to macroeconomic features and past assumptions are worth considering.

It represents a hedge against “crazy,” which is hopefully not what awaits us – but the risk of not preparing for that possibility is verging on irresponsible, and not even thinking about it is likely to end up being prohibitively expensive.

Anyone know what’s going on yet?

The outperformance of bitcoin in 2020 has to set up the asset for even more professional investor attention next year, even though we all know that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Or is it? The momentum trade seems to be the predominant strategy this year, and given the amount of money sloshing around markets looking for a good return, there is no indication that will end soon.

Then again, all bull markets have to end some time, although the underlying fundamentals and investment theses of bitcoin do not get worse with vaccine disappointments and worse-than-expected economic figures – unlike with stock and bond markets.

Chain links

Investors talking:

· Scott Minerd, CIO of fund manager Guggenheim Partners, which manages more than $230 billion worth of assets, told Bloomberg TV hosts this week that his firm’s fundamental analysis shows that bitcoin should be worth $400,000. This conclusion is based on the asset’s scarcity, and its relative value to gold as a percentage of gross domestic product. He also revealed that Guggenheim had started allocating to bitcoin when it was trading at around $10,000.

· U.K.-based fund manager Ruffer Investment Company has invested approximately $740 million in bitcoin, equivalent to around 2.7% of the firm’s assets under management. According to the company, the investment was “primarily a protective move for portfolios” to “act as a hedge” against “some of the risks that we see in a fragile monetary system and distorted financial markets.” Ruffer is known in investment circles as a conservative manager focused on capital preservation. It had the top-performing active fund in Europe for January-June 2020: the LF Ruffer Gold Fund produced a six-month performance of over 55%. And now it’s investing in bitcoin. Ruffer has spoken often in the past about its inflation concerns. This investment makes me want to check in on other active managers worried about inflation – their ranks are growing.

· One River Asset Management, a $1 billion hedge fund (as of April 2020) specializing in volatility plays, has invested $600 million in bitcoin and ether or institutional clients (including Ruffer, which owns a stake in the company) via its subsidiary One River Digital Asset Management. CEO Eric Peters told Bloomberg that One River Digital’s crypto holdings will cross $1 billion in early 2021. Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard is taking an ownership stake in One River Digital and helping to provide the company with back-end trading services.

· Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at investment firm Jefferies, has trimmed the recommended exposure in his model global portfolio from 50% gold in favor of bitcoin. This is even more notable given that this particular portfolio is designed with U.S. pension funds in mind. What’s more, he has said that he plans to increase exposure to bitcoin should there be a correction.

· Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told Bloomberg that bitcoin was a “retail inflation hedge,” and a risk-on growth proxy.

· Not an endorsement, but an interesting and potentially useful thread prompted by tech investor Andrew Wilkinson, co-founder of Tiny Capital.

In market developments:

U.S.-based crypto asset exchange Coinbase has filed preliminary documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public. The Form S-1 is expected to become effective after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions. TAKEAWAY: Here we go … This will create by far the largest listed company in the crypto industry, and has been rumored for some time. As well as attracting even more attention to crypto markets, it is likely to kick off a slate of crypto-related listings, especially given the recent price movements and the swelling of institutional interest. What I’m most excited about, apart from seeing how the market values a systemic crypto market infrastructure business, is getting a look at their balance sheet and P&L.

Cboe Global Markets will launch a suite of crypto market tools in 2021 in a licensing partnership with execution provider CoinRoutes, including cryptocurrency indexes, historical data and real-time ticks. TAKEAWAY: Cboe operates the largest options exchange in the U.S. Coming from a traditional market infrastructure player, this deal signals support for the nascent asset group, and points to the introduction of new crypto services and products over the coming years. S&P also recently revealed crypto index plans, and other market data providers are likely to join the race to capture crypto data market share.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will launch a futures contract on ether (ETH) in February 2021. TAKEAWAY: This goes a long way towards validating ETH as a potentially institutional-grade investment. The lack of liquid ETH derivatives for institutional investors has dampened hedging opportunities, and the removal of these barriers could encourage more professional investors to at least consider its merits.

Advisory company Evercore has named PayPal as its top payments stock, in part because it believes that the firm’s cryptocurrency services could be good for customer engagement and transaction margin. TAKEAWAY: This not only encourages investors to consider companies that are launching crypto asset services; it also encourages more companies to offer crypto asset services, because who doesn’t want investors looking at them?

Sovryn, a self-billed “decentralized platform for trading and lending Bitcoin,” has launched on the Bitcoin sidechain RSK, with $2.1 million in funding. TAKEAWAY: There’s a lot of debate about whether Bitcoin could ever be used for smart contracts. This is a reminder that the jury is still out, and technological progress is pretty good at showing that what many think is impossible is not that impossible after all. If the range of applications that can be built on Bitcoin broadens, that could boost its potential value.

SBI Financial Services, the subsidiary of Japanese tech conglomerate SBI Holdings, has acquired U.K.-based cryptocurrency OTC desk B2C2. TAKEAWAY: This is another example of legacy finance leveraging crypto asset services to broaden its client base, and to sell more to existing clients.

Banca Generali, an Italian private bank that focuses on wealth management for high net worth individuals, is leading a $14 million investment round in crypto wallet provider Conio, with an agreement to offer Conio’s services to the bank’s clients. TAKEAWAY: Yet another legacy bank gears up to offer crypto asset services to its clients. We will see a lot more of this in 2021.

You have banks building or buying crypto asset services, and you also have crypto firms trying to become banks. Crypto payments firm BitPay has filed to become a national bank in the U.S., headquartered in Georgia. TAKEAWAY: By becoming a national bank, BitPay will be able to operate in all U.S. states, while its non-bank competitors will need to get money transmitter licenses in each state they wish to operate in. This confers an operational advantage, and also a strategic advantage in that clients could prefer the additional scrutiny borne by national trust banks, compared to firms that don’t have a national bank license.

Speaking of crypto firms hoping to become banks, crypto asset platform Paxos (which last week filed to become a federally regulated bank) has raised $142 million in a Series C round. TAKEAWAY: Paxos is emerging as a key player in the developing crypto market infrastructure: as well as a crypto exchange itBit, it is building a full-stack infrastructure service that includes custody, tokenized securities, stablecoins and more. It powers PayPal’s new bitcoin offering, and also counts Credit Suisse, Société Générale and Revolut among its clients. (Paxos’ founder, Charles Cascarilla, was named one of CoinDesk’s Most Influential for 2020.) With this amount of funding, it will be interesting to see which of their many services they choose to build out more, or whether they will be adding new market tools to the mix.

Global stocks are now worth around $100 trillion. American companies have raised a record $175 billion in public listings. Some $3 trillion of corporate bonds are trading with negative yields.

All the while the virus spreads, the economic cycle stays on life-support and businesses get thrashed by fresh lockdowns.

Spurred by endless monetary stimulus and bets on a post-pandemic world, day traders and institutional pros alike are enjoying the easiest financial conditions in history.

“Sentiment indicators are moving to euphoria,"" said Cedric Ozazman, chief investment officer at Reyl & Cie in Geneva. “People are now jumping to invest amid fears they will miss the Santa Claus rally.""

Here are the signs of market froth in this year of death, disease and economic calamity.

IPO Boom

Nothing evokes a stock peak like a rush to the public markets. Debuts from Snowflake Inc. to Airbnb Inc. took this year’s initial public offerings volume to a record $175 billion in the U.S., data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Special-purpose acquisition vehicles that raise money for a “blank check"" company to buy whatever it wants have raised over $60 billion in 2020. That’s more than the previous decade combined.

Investors still can’t get enough. The first-day return for IPOs averaged 40% this year, the highest ever other than 1999 and 2000, according to one estimate.

All that has drawn unprecedented interest in the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund tracking new listings, up more than 100% this year this year. Even SPACs that haven’t announced an acquisition target are up almost 20% in 2020, Bespoke Investment Group noted.

“If that isn’t a sign of exuberance, we don’t know what is!"" Bespoke analysts wrote in a note.

Stock Rally

Robinhood traders have become the talk of Wall Street this year by speculating on everything from tech options to airline shares. With these retail investors chasing the equity rally along with institutional pros, the S&P 500 is trading with a sales multiple some 16% above the 2000 peak.

Everything is going up. A Goldman Sachs basket of the most-shorted stocks in the Russell 3000 has surged about 40% this quarter, triple the broader index. High-beta shares are near their highest versus low-volatility ones since 2011.

Every time the Russell 2000 has surged more than 95% off its trough, it has gone on to lose money over the next three months, according to SentimenTrader. It is now up roughly 100% from its March low.

Options Frenzy

Bullish retail investors have plunged into the complex world of derivatives like never before this year. Over the last 20 days, a record average of roughly 22 million call contracts have traded each day across U.S. exchanges.

Cboe’s equity put-call ratio has dropped near a decade low -- a sign traders have rarely ever been so hellbent on chasing upside in single stocks.

Merger Mania

Animal spirits in corporate boardrooms are another infamous sign of a market top. This quarter is shaping up to be the strongest for deal-making activity since 2016 after a record third quarter. S&P Global Inc. buying IHS Markit Ltd. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. taking over Xilinx Inc. are among the blockbusters.

With corporate cash balances rising in recent years and deal volume as a percentage of market value still below a long-time average, it is possible the recent activity is just the start.

Europe Joins In

Even Europe’s IPO market, which is much smaller in size than the one in the U.S. and less accustomed to big first-day pops, is going bananas.

Among the 44 firms that have listed on European exchanges since Nov. 9 -- the day news of a coronavirus vaccine set off a bull run in equities -- the average gain has been 16%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 70% of them are trading above their IPO price.

“Given heightened equity valuations, IPOs are again a viable exit route for sponsors,"" said Darrell Uden, global co-head of ECM at RBC Capital Markets.

Credit Rebound

In a world of almost $18 trillion negative-yielding debt, investors have been forced to gorge on risky corporate bonds at record valuations.

In the U.S., yields on junk bonds have tumbled far below levels at which high-grade borrowers could issue earlier this year.

Even Carnival Corp., the fallen-angel cruise ship operator, has progressively cut funding premiums this year. The stockpile of negative-yielding corporate debt now stands at over $3 trillion.

Emerging Markets

Naturally it’s boom times for emerging-market nations selling more than $730 billion in dollar and euro bonds in 2020, more than in any previous year.

Even with political turmoil, Peru sold the lowest-yielding century bonds ever from a developing-economy government. Ivory Coast priced euro-denominated debt with a lower yield than last year, despite its participation in a G-20 debt relief initiative and an ongoing International Monetary Fund program.

Bitcoin’s Back

To diehards, Bitcoin’s more than 200% surge this year on a wave of new money shows crypto’s time has come. To many on Wall Street, it’s just the latest sign of irrational exuberance.

“We view it and other cryptocurrencies as ‘digital tulips.’ We have no way to value them,"" Yardeni Research analysts including Ed Yardeni wrote in a note. “We do watch Bitcoin’s price action as a gauge of speculative excesses.""

Its volatility is a hard pill to swallow for most but the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. have noted plenty of interest, from family offices to trend-following quants.

The virtual currency is surfing a wave of speculation for long-duration assets, from solar energy to Tesla Inc. shares, as investors seek a stake in a technology of tomorrow -- valuations be damned.

On Wednesday, Dec. 16, we witnessed the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, bitcoin, blow past its previous high and eclipse $20,000 per token. In fact, bitcoin went on to also blow by $21,000 and $22,000 within a matter of hours.

For as volatile as the stock market has been in 2020, you wouldn't know it by looking at bitcoin, which is up by 201% on a year-to-date basis through the late evening of Dec. 16. This jaw-dropping rally is rebuilding the euphoria that overtook the crypto community back in 2017, and probably has folks believing cryptocurrency is a good investment.

But I am not part of that community, nor can I say I ever will be. The higher bitcoin goes, the more convinced I am that it's one of the most dangerous investments. Each of the major buy theses surrounding bitcoin can be easily debunked -- as follows.

""Bitcoin is scarce, and therefore holds incredible value""

One predominant catalyst for bitcoin is the perception of scarcity. It currently has 18.57 million tokens in circulation and a cap of 21 million. Over time, the remaining 2.43 million tokens will be mined via transaction proofing and block rewards. With only so many tokens to go around (fractions of a token can be bought and sold), the buy thesis suggests that this scarcity makes bitcoin an excellent investment.

The problem is that bitcoin lacks genuine scarcity. Its perceived cap of 21 million tokens exists because of computer code. Last I checked, code can always be erased and rewritten. While it's unlikely that a community consensus would be reached to increase the circulating supply of bitcoin, the possibility of this happening isn't zero.

By comparison, a precious metal like gold has a hard supply limit. We can't use alchemy to make more gold. The only gold that's available is what's been mined or is still underground. When the only parameter of scarcity is written computer code, that's not true scarcity.

""Bitcoin is becoming more popular with retailers by the day""

Another buy thesis of bulls is that bitcoin's utility is growing by the day. More businesses are accepting digital tokens for payment, and a broader swath of people are buying bitcoin tokens for the first time. According to financial services company Fundera, around 2,300 U.S. businesses and 15,174 global businesses were accepting bitcoin at the end of 2019. More than a dozen multinational companies also accept bitcoin.

Slam-dunk proof of increasing utility, right? Not so fast.

Even following its monumental rally, bitcoin has a total market value of $400 billion. That compares to approximately $142 trillion in global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. While it's true that not all GDP is consumption based, this $400 billion accounts for less than 0.3% of global GDP.

Furthermore, approximately 40% of bitcoin tokens are being held by long-term investors with no desire to put those tokens into circulation. Rather than having $400 billion in buying power, there's more like $240 billion in purchasing power available, accounting for 0.17% of global GDP in 2019. There are not nearly enough tokens in existence to drive widespread adoption, based on these figures.

As one additional note, there are about 32.5 million businesses in the U.S., including sole proprietorships. Removing these nonemployer businesses leaves 7.7 million companies with at least one paid employee, per the U.S. Census Bureau in 2016. According to Fundera, just 2,300 of these businesses are accepting bitcoin.

Face the facts: There's no widespread utility.

""Bitcoin is the new store of value""

Bitcoin bulls are also pretty convinced that the most popular digital currency is now a bona fide store of value: i.e., an asset, commodity, or currency that maintains its value.

Every month, the Federal Reserve is buying roughly $120 billion in government-backed debt. When coupled with the central banks' pledge to keep its federal funds rate at or near record lows, it's pretty evident that the U.S. dollar will be under pressure. Crypto investors believe that a ballooning money supply is a green flag for bitcoin to head significantly higher.

The issues I have with the store-of-value thesis are twofold. First, bitcoin isn't backed by any other asset or government. Therefore, it has no tie-ins or official relationship to the movements of the U.S. dollar. Implying that a ballooning money supply should push bitcoin higher is nothing more than a dart throw.

Second, store-of-value assets are designed to maintain their value over time and protect investors from volatility. Yet in March, bitcoin nearly lost half of its value in a 24-hour period. In 2018, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap shed over 80% of its value. In 2013, bitcoin lost about half its value in about six hours. This isn't how a store-of-value asset behaves.

The truth is, buying bitcoin is pure speculation.

""You're naïve! A digital payment revolution is underway, and it's led by bitcoin""

Bitcoin optimists will also crow about bitcoin leading the digital payments revolution. Going cashless could resolve the issues created by certain regions of the world being underbanked. Additionally, the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin could revolutionize the payment processing and settlement time frame, especially in cross-border transactions.

While I don't disagree that a digital payments revolution is underway, or that blockchain could offer global financial and supply chain solutions, bitcoin isn't the vessel that's going to make this vision a reality.

The interesting thing about blockchain is that it can be tethered to multiple types of digital currency, be used in conjunction with fiat currency, or can operate independent of a tethered token. There's absolutely zero evidence that bitcoin is necessary to support a blockchain revolution.

To add, buying bitcoin tokens does not give an investor any ownership in the underlying blockchain. With no ownership in the solution that has the potential to actually drive this digital revolution, bitcoin investors are pinning their hopes on other investors being willing to pay more for a currency that exists only in computer code than they did.

So, why is bitcoin rallying? I'd surmise it's a combination of short-term emotions, technical analysis (i.e., pretty charts), and a grossly inefficient crypto market that overwhelmingly favors the buy side. After all, it's nowhere near as easy to bet against bitcoin as it is to bet against a publicly traded stock.

History has proved that sentiment can shift at the drop of a pin in the cryptocurrency space. I'd suggest investors keep their distance from bitcoin.",2020-12-20 00:00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/real-madrid-joins-ethereum-game-sorare/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Real Madrid has joined the NFT soccer game Sorare.

Sergio Ramos, Marco Asensio, and more are now available to trade and own as NFTs.

Update follows Gerard Piqué’s recent $3.6 million investment in Sorare.

Share this article

Real Madrid is now live on Ethereum. The Spanish soccer team has joined Sorare, a fantasy game for trading digital collectibles.

Real Madrid Moves On-Chain

Real Madrid, one of the world’s most celebrated soccer clubs, has moved onto the blockchain.

The team’s all-star cast of players has been made available as non-fungible tokens, commonly referred to as NFTs, in the fantasy soccer game Sorare.

The Sorare team announced the news via Twitter on Dec. 17. The update enables NFT enthusiasts to trade tokens of Real Madrid players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Ramos, and Luka Modrić and use them to compete in a fantasy league.

In this case, the tokens have three levels of scarcity: 100, 10, or unique. They all live on the Ethereum blockchain.

Auctions for the digital collectibles opened this week and have already generated huge interest. Several of the auctions are due to close over the weekend, with the highest bids in the thousands of euros. The highest-priced token, one of 10 Marco Asensio cards, is going for €5,036.82 at writing.

There’s also a bundle set including Luka Jović, Mariano Diaz, Andriy Lunin, Luka Modrić, and a unique Sergio Ramos, and it’s already received a bid of €6,798.81 with just a few hours remaining.

Sorare Bringing Soccer to Ethereum

The Real Madrid team isn’t the first to list with Sorare. The Bayern Munich squad is also available, with the most sought after token of Serge Gnabry bidding at €2,064.02. The Canada and Cyprus teams are also listed among other players.

Last month, too, a unique token of Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé sold for €55,105.04 to a bidder called maxmersch.

The game has caught attention within the soccer world, too. This week, the Barcelona center-back Gerard Piqué announced that he was making a $3.6 million seed investment in the company. “I see a huge potential in the sports gaming segment in a digital economy where the attention of audiences is the single most important unit of currency,” he said in a press release.

If Piqué is right, there could be a bright future for Sorare if they continue to draw interest across the sport.

The NFT Boom

The NFT space has been thriving recently.

Just this week, rap superstar Lil Yachty auctioned off a unique NFT for $16,050 to celebrate the release of his Ethereum-based YACHTY token.

A few days before that, the legendary digital artist Beeple made over $3.5 million from his latest “Everydays” collection drop.

Both sales ran on Nifty Gateway, an NFT auction house run by the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. Another respected NFT artist, Trevor Jones, fetched $55,555.55 and $111,377 for his pieces “Picasso’s Bull” and “Genesis.”

As DeFi experienced exponential growth on Ethereum in 2020, the NFT boom highlighted that other use cases for the blockchain follow a similarly explosive trajectory. Real Madrid on Sorare is only the latest addition to the movement.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this feature owned ETH among a number of other cryptocurrencies.

""Are such large transactions even possible?"" the Tesla CEO asked in a follow-up inquiry. Saylor said they are.

The exchange followed a week of new records for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency crossed $20,000 for the first time ever last Wednesday, and briefly soared over $24,000 on Saturday.

Elon Musk inquired about ""large"" bitcoin transactions during a Sunday Twitter exchange with cryptocurrency booster Michael Saylor, the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy.

The back-and-forth kicked off when the Tesla CEO tweeted a racy meme suggesting he's ""trying to live a normal productive life,"" but is being tempted by the coin, which has gained more than 220% year-to-date.

Saylor responded by suggesting Musk should do his shareholders a ""$100 billion favor"" and convert the Tesla balance sheet from US dollars to bitcoin. Saylor then upped the stakes when assessing how the move could impact other major corporations.

""Other firms on the S&P 500 would follow your lead & in time it would grow to become a $1 trillion favor,"" Saylor added.

Musk responded with a question: ""Are such large transactions even possible?""

Saylor said they are, and explained he's purchased over $1.3 billion in bitcoin in the past months and he's ""happy to share"" his playbook with Musk offline.

Key Takeaways On-chain metrics reveal that while BTC whales have gone into a selling spree, Bitcoin may rebound and post further gains.

Ethereum's technicals, on the other hand, show that ETH could jump by more than 30% in the near term future.

Bitcoin's recent all-time highs may be responsible for these trends, as experts suggest it is time for investors to realize profits.

Share this article

The cryptocurrency market began this week with slumping prices in the aftermath of Bitcoin’s recent all-time highs. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum have significantly retraced in the past 24 hours, both cryptocurrencies hold above crucial support levels that may determine where they are headed next.

Bitcoin Must Hold Above Key Support

Bitcoin’s uptrend appears to have reached exhaustion after prices rose to a new all-time high of $24,400 on Dec. 20. Since then, the cryptocurrency’s price has fallen by more than 6.50%. The downswing pushed Bitcoin to a critical support level that will determine whether prices can fall further.

Based on IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP model, the $22,660 support barrier poses a lot of significance to Bitcoin’s trend. Transaction history shows that nearly 478,000 addresses previously purchased more than 560,000 BTC around this price.

Such a vital demand area could absorb some of the recent selling pressure, preventing prices from falling further. On the other hand, if this support level breaks, it could be catastrophic for investors betting on the upside. The IOMAP cohorts show that the next significant interest area reinforcing Bitcoin’s uptrend sits around $20,500.

If the $22,660 support were to break, BTC holders should expect their investments to plunge by another 10%.

Bitcoin Sell Pressure Rising

Given the high probability of a steeper correction, it seems that BTC whales have taken advantage of the recent price action to realize profits. Santiment’s holder distribution chart shows that the selling pressure behind Bitcoin rose dramatically over the past few days.

Indeed, the number of addresses holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC plunged. Roughly 31 whales left the network or redistributed their tokens, representing a 1.40% decline in such a short period.

At first glance, the downtrend in the number of large investors on the Bitcoin network may seem insignificant. However, when considering that these whales hold between $23 million and $230 billion in BTC, the sudden spike in sell orders can translate into billions of dollars.

If the selling spree continues, Bitcoin may have the ability to slice through the $22,660 support level and drop to $20,500.

Despite this grim worst-case scenario, the cryptocurrency market’s unpredictability means the bullish outlook is not out of the question.

The IOMAP model shows that Bitcoin faces little to no resistance in the future. The only considerable supply wall sits at $23,500, where roughly 300,000 addresses obtain over 90,000 BTC.

In light of that fact, it may not take enormous buying pressure to invalidate the pessimistic outlook and lead to new all-time highs.

Ethereum Poised to Jump to $800

Ethereum entered a downtrend over the past five days, which has caused its price to drop by more than 12%. ETH recently went from trading at a new yearly high of $678 to a low of $585.

Despite the significant losses incurred in such a short period, ETH looks primed for higher highs. The development of an ascending triangle on ETH’s 3-hour chart suggests that a spike in buying pressure around the current price levels could see Ethereum revisit its recent highs and advance further.

Indeed, Ethereum prices could rise nearly 30% upon breaking the $620 resistance barrier. This target is determined by measuring the distance between the triangle’s two highest points and adding it to the breakout point.

The TD Sequential indicator suggests that Ethereum is bound for new yearly highs. This technical index presented a buy signal in the form of a green nine candlestick within the same time frame.

If validated, ETH prices could rise for up to four 3-hour candlesticks or begin a new upward countdown.

A glimpse at Ethereum’s 3-hour chart reveals that the TD setup has accurately anticipated local tops and bottoms on this altcoin’s trend. The buy and sell signals this indicator presented since early December were all validated, resulting in significant price movements.

Thus, the current optimistic forecast will likely be validated regardless of the “extreme” levels of greed among market participants.

The Cryptocurrency Market Moves Forward

Bitcoin has recently touched all-time highs and produced largely bullish sentiment among investors.

That has led some of the most prominent analysts in the industry to suggest that it is time to realize profits. For instance, trading veteran Peter Brandt publicly stated that he exited 20% of his Bitcoin position because bull rallies are often accompanied by “short-term blow-offs.”

While multiple bearish signals are popping up on the higher time frames, it seems that Bitcoin and Ethereum’s fate will be determined by two demand barriers. Bitcoin bulls must prevent prices from falling below $22,660 to avoid further losses. Meanwhile, Ethereum will likely take a significant nosedive if the $595 support fails to hold.

As long as these price hurdles continue to hold, the uptrend will remain intact, and the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization will aim for higher highs.

According to onchain statistics, there is a colossal amount of bitcoin, approximately 141,231 bitcoins or $3.3 billion at the time of publication locked into Ethereum-based tokens. There are roughly seven different wrapped or synthetic bitcoin tokens but the Wrapped Bitcoin project has the lion’s share of coins with 115,411 under custody.

At the time of writing, there is a great number of bitcoin (BTC) locked into the Ethereum (ETH) network for projects that have issued wrapped or synthetic BTC tokens. Right now there’s 141,231 BTC being leveraged on Ethereum between seven different projects. The largest of them all is the Wrapped Bitcoin project (WBTC), which is an ERC20 token but the BTC is held in a custodial fashion by the firm Bitgo. At press time, the WBTC project commands a whopping 115,411 BTC which is worth $2.6 billion using today’s exchange rates.

The six projects below BTC collectively hold 28,151 BTC ($677.7M) at the time of publication, according to Dune Analytics data. This includes projects like renbtc (17,122), hbtc (6,010), tbtc (1,906), sbtc (1,903), imbtc (1,035), and pbtc (175). Moving a wrapped or synthetic bitcoin would be far cheaper as the current median cost of transfer on the Ethereum chain today is $0.54 per transaction. The next block fee for the BTC network is $7.68 per transaction and the current median fee for BTC today is $3.71.

A great deal of wrapped or synthetic bitcoin tokens on Ethereum leveraged on decentralized exchanges (dex) and loan platforms that yield high interest. During the last seven days, ETH-based dex applications like Uniswap and 0x have seen $5.5 billion in swaps and $579 million in trades during the last 24 hours.

WBTC is the sixth-largest token in terms of the share of loans for the top ten ERC20 assets. As far as outstanding loans per asset is concerned there’s roughly $45 million worth of WBTC on loan today.

It didn’t take long for the Ethereum network to gather a lot more bitcoin since tokenized BTC assets held on ETH crossed $1 billion notional at the end of September. Of course, the price of bitcoin (BTC) jumping 129% during the last three months contributed to the value held.

Despite the detractors, Ethereum clearly is Bitcoin’s main sidechain as competitors are not even close to 141,231 BTC being leveraged on the ETH chain.

For instance, Blockstream’s Liquid network only has 2,599 lbtc issued and the RSK sidechain has a circulating supply of 541 rbtc. WBTC is the second-largest decentralized finance (defi) project according to defipulse.com statistics. Due to BTC’s current value, WBTC’s market is also the 16th-largest by market capitalization today.

(Bloomberg) -- India’s monetary policy makers are poised to hold interest rates this week as the economy faces a renewed threat to growth from the pandemic, with new cases hitting a record.All 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the six-member Monetary Policy Committee to keep the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 4% on April 7. Traders will watch for an explicit forward guidance from the Reserve Bank of India on how long the policy stance will stay accommodative and liquidity abundant despite stubborn inflation.Sticky underlying price pressures had earlier stoked expectations of policy normalization amid signs of a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. But those gains could come undone quickly if consumer demand is hit due to curbs on movement, such as those imposed in the capital New Delhi and by the state of Maharashtra, which houses the financial hub of Mumbai and contributes about 15% of the national output.“The current state of affairs will ensure that RBI will not pull back accommodative measures in a hurry,” said Teresa John, economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai, who expects a status quo.Here’s what to watch for in the MPC decision to be announced by Governor Shaktikanta Das in Mumbai on Wednesday morning:Growth ProspectsIn February, the central bank said it expects the economy to expand 10.5% in the year that began April 1 after an estimated 7.7% contraction in the previous 12 months. While Das has indicated there is no immediate threat to that forecast, he could still flag downside risks, given the current surge in virus cases that’s hurting mobility and consumption.Inflation ForecastWith Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government renewing the central bank’s mandate of keeping inflation between 2%-6% for another five years, policy makers are likely to reiterate that fighting price pressures will be a top priority. Fuel and food prices, which make up more than 50% of the consumer price index, represent the biggest problem for rate setters, given their ripple effect on inflationary expectations and underlying price pressures.India is among the few emerging markets in Asia where inflation is above the midpoint of its target band, due largely to food prices that are rising after a brief drop. Economists in a recent Bloomberg survey saw CPI at 5% in the April-June period before easing to 4.7% in the next three months. That compares with the central bank’s forecast of 5%-5.2% for the April to September period.“The risks of increasing input costs, higher commodity prices, seasonal upside in food prices and better pricing power could prod the MPC to relook at its inflation forecasts,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, local lockdowns, if they persist, could impact services demand negatively and put downward pressure on first-quarter core inflation and may act as a balancing factor.”Yield ControlBond investors will be watching on how active the RBI is with its version of yield curve control and how long the accommodative monetary stance lasts.“The market is expecting extended forward guidance in policy stance, from ‘going into next fiscal year’ to say ‘end of calendar year,’” said Naveen Singh, head of fixed income at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai.The bond market is facing another year of near record supply amid weak appetite for debt. Benchmark yields rose 30 basis points last quarter, the most since 2018 amid a sharp spike in U.S. yields and crude prices. Governor Das has assured investors that RBI will help ease the supply burden by purchasing at least 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion) of bonds through open market purchases, or OMOs, and more durable cash injection to compensate for the withdrawal of a relaxation in a cash reserve ratio.“We expect the RBI to reiterate that surplus liquidity will remain ample to support growth and that the space created by CRR reversal will be offset by OMO purchases of bonds to help bridge the gap between demand-supply of bonds and prevent longer-end bond yields from shooting up excessively in a short period of time,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG.(updates survey details in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoins-ethereum-defi,"After the past week’s record bitcoin volume for 2020, the price dipped on lower volume.

Bitcoin’s price rode a roller coaster up and down over the past 24 hours. After a steady run above $23,800 in early hours trading, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dumped as low as $21,960, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price recovered somewhat to $22,843 as of press time.

Lower-than-average volume led to a thinner-than-usual market Monday as many traders were likely staying on the sidelines with the holidays and new year quickly approaching.

“Trading activity is subdued. That doesn’t motivate anyone to trade on Christmas week,” said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula.

After Dec. 17’s combined volume record $4.7 billion day across major exchanges Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit, Kraken and Poloniex, that figure was much lower, down to $2.5 billion as of press time Monday.

Despite this, big-time buyers in the over-the-counter market have helped keep bitcoin well above the $20,000 level, first breached back on December 16.

“Real demand from largely price-insensitive institutional buying drove us into that level, and the resulting fireworks we saw on the break came from the leveraged side as roughly half the market’s outstanding leveraged short positions were liquidated,” quant trading firm QCP wrote in an investor note Monday.

On derivatives venue BitMEX, over $44 million in sell liquidations, the crypto equivalent of a margin call, occurred, which put some pressure on the market for bitcoin to head lower. Sell liquidations are triggered when leveraged long positions start losing a significant portion of the money the buyer posted to place the trade.

Cooper Turley, editor of newsletter DeFi Rate, told CoinDesk that Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade dynamics, which also includes staking in the network, played a role in the amount of ether locked, dipping and then recovering somewhat. “People unlocked ETH to stake via [Eth 2.0] and trade it during the recent run-up,” Turley said. “Now that things have settled a bit, most that did not stake into [Eth 2.0] are depositing back into DeFi.”

The inflows plus the latest price moves lifted assets under management for the sector to nearly $19 billion in 2020. Assets under management ended 2019 at just $2.57 billion.

Interest in cryptocurrencies skyrocketed this year as investors saw bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and as an alternative to the depreciating dollar.

Bitcoin hit yet another all-time peak of $24,298.04 on Sunday, but was last down nearly 3% at $22,832.78, hit by a wave of risk-off moves in financial markets on worries about the new coronavirus strain.

On Monday ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, fell 4.4% to $610.14.

Inflows into investment crypto investment products totaled $335 million as of Friday, with bitcoin flows accounting for $792.1 million, the data showed. Ethereum had $207.3 million in weekly flows.

So far this year, investors pumped $15.6 billion into bitcoin products and funds, while ethereum inflows reached nearly $2.5 billion.

“It’s no secret that there are a few big players in the bitcoin/crypto space and that it is mostly crowded with retail-related traders and investors,” said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts, a technical analysis and financial charting platform for online retail investors.

Bitcoin was founded in 2009 by a programmer or group of programmers who go by the presumed pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto . Since then, it has influenced waves of prosperity and volatility alike in the cryptocurrency world.

Though Bitcoin is the best known and most highly valued cryptocurrency, its price fluctuations often correlate with increases and decreases across other forms of crypto — though there are exceptions.

While there is evidence of long-term correlation, it's not all set in stone. Ethereum has expressed numerous cases of independent fluctuation outside of Bitcoin.

However, when an event is caused by a specific influencing factor rather than holistic market issues, Bitcoin may have a reverse effect on other cryptocurrencies.

Michael van de Poppe, a cryptocurrency market analyst for the Amsterdam Stock Exchange told a Cointelegraph reporter that ""Bitcoin is king and usually the rest will follow in the market.""

In 2018, Bitcoin experienced such a crash, and all the other cryptocurrencies followed suit shortly after. This is just one example of how Bitcoin's price affects other altcoins. Experts say Bitcoin has the largest effect on Ethereum.

In the cryptocurrency market, correlation can apply to all assets at once. This makes it different from the stock market in that diversification may not protect the asset holder in a crash.

Right now, meme-centric altcoin Dogecoin is trending , but that's primarily a result of Elon Musk's involvement in the cryptocurrency conversation.

While the best cryptocurrency is subjective, there's no denying the importance of certain altcoins in the market. Today, that includes Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

On Sunday, Dec. 20, Tesla founder and billionaire Elon Musk spearheaded a Twitter conversation with Michael Saylor.

Saylor is a known cryptocurrency booster and CEO of Microstrategy, Inc. He told Musk that it would make sense to transition Tesla's large transactions from U.S. dollars to Bitcoin.

Musk responded by boosting a once-parodical altcoin called Dogecoin. The market responded by investing heavily in Dogecoin, causing its value to leap upwards of 20 percent.

This just goes to show how sensitive cryptocurrency valuations are. With Bitcoin's value soaring above the $24,000 mark in mid-December, some experts say cryptocurrencies are bound for a fruitful year while others suggest it could all come crashing down.

Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory corporation deVere Group, says the new year will likely see traders seeking profits. As a result, the record high could dip slightly, but not as much as it fell in 2018. Green suspects the dip would recover quickly.

One River Asset Management, a hedge fund specializing in volatility bets, has amassed substantial holdings and commitments, worth about $1 billion by 2021, in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ether (ETHUSD), according to a report by Bloomberg.

Eric Peters, the firm's founder, told the publication that he intends to set up a ""blue-chip fiduciary"" for cryptocurrencies targeted at institutional investors. The hedge fund has partnered with Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS), which recently announced a partnership with Standard Chartered PLC (SCBFF), for custody and with San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase for trade execution.

Key Takeaways A hedge fund specializing in volatility bets has amassed holdings worth more than $1 billion in Bitcoin and Ether.

Other institutional investors and hedge funds are also buying up large holdings of Bitcoin, turning themselves into whales.

Peters is not the only one building holdings in Bitcoin. One of his investors, London-based investment firm Ruffer LLP, disclosed a 2.5% holding of Bitcoin in its Ruffer Multi-Strategies Fund recently. The holding was worth approximately $740 million as of last week.

""We see this as a small but potent insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world's major currencies,"" Ruffer LLP wrote in a memo. The firm described Bitcoin as a ""hedge to some of the monetary and market risks that we see.""

The term Bitcoin whales refers to institutions or individuals with large holdings of Bitcoin, significant enough to influence the cryptocurrency's price trajectory. For example, some blame the 2017 bull run in crypto markets on Bitcoin whales, who are supposed to have led and then exited the trades after booking profits.

Because Bitcoin is a pseudonymous asset in which owners are identified by their assets, it is difficult to accurately identify the cryptocurrency's biggest holders. However, according to btc.com, 13.5% of Bitcoin owners hold 10,000 or more units of the cryptocurrency, amounting to approximately 2.5 million Bitcoin in total. One River and Ruffer LLP's investments fall in this category. About 18.5 million Bitcoin have been mined so far, and the total number is supposed to cap at 21 million.

Why Are Firms Investing in Bitcoin?

Both One River and Ruffer LLP cited macroeconomic risks arising from the current economic crisis as reasons for their investment in cryptocurrencies. It also helps that Bitcoin's price has been on a tear recently, setting new all-time high records.

The unchecked fiscal spending by central banks has debased national currencies and could cause inflation, according to Peters from One River. Low interest rates on bonds and other savings instruments have further exacerbated the situation by closing off other investment avenues.

Bitcoin's capped supply and appreciating price has the potential to act as an alternate hedge instrument for investors comfortable with volatility. Peters has joined the ranks of Bitcoin enthusiasts and said that the current situation will result in a ""generational allocation to this new asset class."" According to the hedge fund founder, ""The flows have only just begun.""",2020-12-21 18:29:13.760000+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/21/bitcoin-may-be-down-but-these-cryptocurrency-miner/,"What happened

The bitcoin rally has faded for now. According to CoinDesk, bitcoin hit an all-time high of $24,273 on Sunday, but it's pulled back about 6% as of this writing. But even though bitcoin is down today, stocks for bitcoin miners are up. Consider how these stocks ended the day:

Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Riot Blockchain NASDAQ:RIOT)

Bit Digital NASDAQ:BTBT)

The movement of these stocks could have a very simple explanation: Stocks don't trade on the weekends. By contrast, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be bought and sold 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

So what

Bitcoin hit its all-time high over the weekend, while the stock market was closed. Since cryptocurrency-miner stocks tend to follow the price of bitcoin up and down, it's only logical to see them going up today now that the stock market is open.

To be clear, we can rule out alternative catalysts. None of these companies reported news, and I couldn't find new coverage from prominent stock analysts. Furthermore, there's no reason to believe Marathon, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital stocks are going up from a short squeeze. According to data from Nasdaq, each stock has minimal short interest (people betting against these stocks) and all can be covered in one day. Without getting too technical, suffice it to say this isn't a ripe short-squeeze situation.

Here's why cryptocurrency miner stocks follow the price of bitcoin: The bitcoin network is run by a decentralized network of computers that keep track of transactions. You could even set up your own computer to do this if you wanted, but you'd be competing against much faster and more powerful computers. These compete against each other to process transactions the fastest, and new bitcoin is awarded to the winner. This is the cryptocurrency mining process.

Mining bitcoin has a real cost to it. Miners pay for their spaces, equipment, and electricity. While each company's cost structure is unique, they've all struggled to make a profit in recent years. Over time, the cost to mine bitcoin goes up; if the price of bitcoin doesn't go up fast enough, it's not profitable.

Consider recent financial data from Bit Digital. It reported results for the third quarter of 2020 on Dec. 18, covering year-to-date results through Sept. 30. In that nine-month span, the company had a net loss from continuing operations below $1 million. In other words, its business basically broke even. However, for most of that time, the price of bitcoin was less than $10,000. The price has since more than doubled, increasing Bit Digital's opportunity to profit.

Marathon, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital all generate revenue by mining bitcoin. Because the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since September, these companies should start bringing in more revenue and have a shot at higher prices. That's why these stocks go up with bitcoin.

Now what

Investing legend Warren Buffett once said, ""A horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse -- not a remarkable mathematician."" He meant that a company can be a standout when compared to others in its industry, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great business or investment opportunity. I personally think this applies to cryptocurrency miners.

Don't get me wrong, I like some cryptocurrencies, and I even bought bitcoin and Ether. I see it as a simple case of supply and demand. Specifically, the supply of bitcoin is limited -- and recently we've seen a surge in demand from corporate entities. For example, technology company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) announced it just purchased $650 million in bitcoin, and has now invested over $1 billion in 2020. This increasing demand coupled with limited supply could keep pushing bitcoin prices higher.

So I do believe cryptocurrency prices can continue to rise. I'm just not sure that bitcoin miners are the best way to invest in this trend. Even if profits for Marathon, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital soar in 2021, it's only a matter of time before cash flow would need to be invested in upgrading their equipment. I'm not sure that leaves much room for creating shareholder value long-term.

There are plenty of other cryptocurrency stocks that could hold more potential. Specifically, consider companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's products are used for gaming, artificial intelligence, and more. But it has powerful hardware that can be used in bitcoin-mining operations as well. In other words, the company could benefit from bitcoin miners buying new equipment, but its business isn't dependent upon that happening. And I think Buffett would agree that that's a better horse to bet on.",2020-12-21 00:00:00

The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.

The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which The Wall Street Journal calls “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.

At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: is it a security or a currency? According to the SEC’s suit, it’s a security, and so Ripple didn’t provide its investors with the proper information they needed to assess any potential risk. According to Garlinghouse, it’s a virtual currency, which means the SEC has nothing to do with it. The SEC has previously ruled that bitcoin and Ethereum are currencies. Also, the Justice Department treated XRP as a currency in 2015, when Ripple settled a suit over its business.

But XRP differs from bitcoin and Ethereum in an important way. For those two cryptocurrencies, new coins are created through a “mining” process, which is ongoing. Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency.

I appreciate you saying what this could mean for the larger U.S. crypto industry. The SEC is doing the opposite of “fostering innovation” here in the US. It’s not just XRP they’re attacking here. https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 22, 2020

The SEC has won similar suits against Block.one and Kik in the past, saying that the initial coin offerings these startups offered were actually securities. But those cases were different; Kik and Block.one did their ICOs after an SEC directive in 2017. XRP came into existence years before that directive.

The lawsuit didn’t come as a surprise; Garlinghouse announced yesterday that the company expected the suit, and Ripple has already published its Wells response, a document that explains to the SEC that its actions were legal.

An important part of settling whether XRP is a currency or a security may involve something called the Howey test, which was created by a 1946 Supreme Court case. That ruling defined a security as an investment of money in a shared enterprise with an expectation of profits from others’ work. According to Ripple, XRP doesn’t satisfy the Howey test for a variety of reasons, but especially because no one bought XRP with the expectation of getting Ripple’s profits.

The SEC’s complaint challenges that. In 2016, Ripple admitted to the New York State Department of Financial Services that buyers were “purchasing XRP for speculative purposes.” It also cites a hedge fund investor who owned XRP saying in 2015 that “the increase in XRP value is heavily dependent on the success of Ripple.”",2020-12-22 00:00:00,https://www.axios.com/cryptocurrency-firm-ripple-sec-sued-63bd62bb-9221-447a-b4af-b2db30dd7c42.html,"Ripple, one of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency companies, on Monday disclosed that the SEC plans to sue the company, its CEO and its executive chairman for allegedly selling unlicensed securities.

Why it matters: This could put a chill on some crypto industry investment, as Ripple has no interest in settling fast and moving on. It also could mildly complicate the upcoming IPO for Coinbase, where XRP-to-dollar activity made up 15% of trading volume over the past 30 days (per Nomics).

The basic backstory: Ripple in 2012 conjured a cryptocurrency called XRP, and has been gradually selling it off in scheduled allotments. This differs from the “mining” process used to create more traditionally-decentralized tokens like Bitcoin and Ether.

XRP’s current total value is around $22 billion, with Ripple still holding the majority of it in its treasury.

Ripple didn't register XRP as a security before selling it to third-party investors. Instead, it’s maintained that XRP is a virtual currency, in part relying on definitions contained in a 2015 settlement with the U.S. Justice Department (whose investigation was led by Katie Haun, now a partner with early Ripple investor Andreessen Horowitz).

The SEC has determined that several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not securities. But it's also argued that certain cryptocurrencies are securities, and that others were securities at the time of initial sale and later morphed into virtual currencies. Those falling afoul of the SEC have included Kik/Kin and Telegram.

In this case, the SEC believes XRP was a security both at the time of sale and today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tells me.

Garlinghouse says that the company has been in consistent talks with the SEC for years, but that he didn't know a lawsuit was imminent until yesterday.

He argues that outgoing SEC commissioner Jay Clayton is ""picking winners"" and seeking to codify a Bitcoin/Ether duopoly. ""This is what an authoritarian government like China would do.""

He also argues that Ripple's control over XRP is overstated, saying the company recently opposed two proposed developer changes and was outvoted.

When I asked if he has the stomach for a prolonged legal fight with the U.S. government, he laughingly replied: ""How long have you known me?""

Crypto VCs are split on the significance of this pending suit beyond Ripple and the XRP ecosystem.

Some say they plan to take a breather until they have a better understanding of the SEC's argument, Ripple's defense and how both could apply to other cryptocurrency upstarts. They also want to see who Joe Biden picks to succeed Jay Clayton and watch how proposed Treasury Department rule-making plays out.

Others believe this is an issue specific to Ripple, which has long been a crypto industry lightning rod, and that the SEC's actions have little bearing on startup activity — particularly efforts building on top of Bitcoin or Ether.

The bottom line: Jay Clayton is dropping a bomb on his way out the door, and the crypto industry will be left to assess the damage.",,https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-company-ripple-faces-sec-lawsuit-5093444,"Ripple, the company behind XRP (XRPUSD) – the world's third most valuable cryptocurrency – said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to sue it in the coming days for selling unlicensed securities. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse disclosed that the federal agency had informed the company of the lawsuit. Ripple also put out a statement late Monday claiming that the planned SEC legal action was ""fundamentally wrong as a matter of law and fact"" and confirming that it will fight the lawsuit. The SEC has declined comment on the suit.

Key Takeaways Ripple's CEO says that the SEC is filing a lawsuit against his company for selling unlicensed securities.

Ripple has always had a controversial status within the crypto ecosystem because it does not strictly adhere to the crypto paradigm of decentralization.

Ripple will fight the lawsuit, according to the company's CEO.

Why Does the SEC Want to Sue Ripple?

Ripple's XRP has been an outlier in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for quite some time. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, it does not have a capped output and is pre-mined. Both characteristics have opened it to charges of being centralized.

According to a previous lawsuit filed against the company in 2019, 20% of the 100 billion XRP tokens mined during Ripple's founding in 2012 were awarded to its founders. Another 20% were set aside for trading in the markets, and the remaining 60% were held in escrow to be periodically released into the markets at Ripple's discretion. The suit charged Ripple with conducting an ""unending ICO"" (initial coin offering) as founders promoted XRP online while selling off their holdings of the cryptocurrency. XRP's holdings and the alleged actions of XRP's founders flout the Howey test used by the SEC to determine security status for investment contracts.

XRP's setup is also a contrast to Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, which have decentralized systems of mining and distribution. In previous announcements, the SEC has said that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities. A Wall Street Journal story on the Ripple lawsuit states that the parent company's current holding of XRP is about 6.4 billion, and 48 billion XRP are held in escrow. Ripple open-sourced its XRP development platform in 2013. However, the Enterprise Software, which is aimed at providing services to financial institutions, is still closed to outside developers.

Ripple's Counter Argument

For its part, Ripple has stated that XRP is a ""fully functional ecosystem and a real use case as a bridge currency that does not rely on Ripple's efforts for its functionality or price."" CEO Garlinghouse also cited the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCEN) 2015 settlement with Ripple in which the agency settled with the company for violating anti-money laundering (AML) and Banking Secrecy Act (BSA) laws.

The CEO took aim at departing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on Twitter, accusing him of ""taking notes from the Grinch"" in announcing the lawsuit during Christmas week. ""Clayton did this with one foot out the door. Rather shamefully, he has decided to sue Ripple, and leave the legal work to the next chairman,"" he told Fortune. Ripple has threatened to move its headquarters to Japan and Singapore, citing onerous regulations in the United States.

Garlinghouse has characterized the action as a broadside against the entire cryptocurrency industry. The political slant of his tweets is notable because he had earlier said that the incoming Biden administration would be friendlier to cryptocurrencies than the current one.",2020-12-22 18:45:10.839000+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bitcoin-price-highs-revive-old-misconceptions-about-btc-and-crypto,"As anyone following the crypto industry will have noticed, yes, Bitcoin (BTC) did recently smash its previous all-time high of around $20,000. Now, many analysts anticipate the cryptocurrency to eventually rise to the mid-$30,000s or even higher within the next few years.

As things stand, BTC is trading at around $23,300, briefly testing the $24,000 mark on several occasions. However, despite all of these positive developments, many prominent individuals from the financial mainstream have spoken negatively about the crypto industry, using cliche adages — such as “crypto is for criminals” and “crypto is all hype, no substance,” etc. — to describe BTC and other prominent digital currencies.

For example, renowned economist and financial strategist David Rosenberg recently referred to Bitcoin as a “massive bubble,” propping up the argument by saying that the supply curve of Bitcoin is unknown even though some people claim to know otherwise. Similarly, Mark Cuban, who is generally quite open-minded in regard to various futuristic technologies, also bashed Bitcoin, claiming that it is “more religion than solution.” However, he did concede that despite its shortcomings, it may be useful as a store of value.

And while crypto tech is far from perfect — admittedly being many years away from replacing legacy financial instruments such as fiat — the aforementioned opinions may seem to come across as the ramblings of annoyed traditionalists who fail to see the immense potential of the technology.

2020 bull run is different from 2017

As soon as Bitcoin broke the $20,000 mark, it was inevitable that analysts from across the board would seek to use the “this bull run is the same as 2017” argument to undermine the financial traction being gained by the industry as a whole.

In this regard, “CryptoYoda,” an independent cryptocurrency analyst, pointed out to Cointelegraph that one can see that the fearful perspective provided by the financial mainstream stems from a lack of understanding of the technology. As such, he believes that what is happening right now is a shift from debt-based fiat currency to trustless financial systems:

“What has changed? Everything. While the 2017 bull run was largely driven by early adopters and retail, this bull run is being dictated by institutional players entering the market. [...] As of now, institutions buy a multiple of what is being mined per day. When one institution accumulates 500MM in BTC, it means that 500MM is no longer available for the other key players observing the market for entry.”

In a similar line of thinking, Jason Lau, chief operating officer of OKCoin, told Cointelegraph that it’s safe to say that the long-looming promise of mainstream players entering the crypto space has finally been fulfilled. In his view, this ongoing bull run has been driven by traditional financial institutions buying Bitcoin price dips as an investment and treasury product: “They have a long term strategy for these assets. So with increased demand, HODLing, and fewer block rewards due to the recent halving, the price may have no limits.”

Additionally, another major difference between the ongoing cycle and the one witnessed before is that back in 2017, the industry was in the midst of a feverish initial coin offering craze, with the bubble duly bursting within just a few month’s time, resulting in the entire crypto economy crashing almost overnight.

According to Adam O’Neill, chief marketing officer of Bitrue — a digital-asset management platform — these days, people in crypto are much more pragmatic, adding: “Publicly-listed companies like MicroStrategy and PayPal have come on board, and the growth of the CME Bitcoin Futures market indicates increased demand for regulated exposure.”

Crypto can’t, and shouldn’t, be compared to traditional financial mediums

It is no secret that despite its bullish outlook, a certain degree of uncertainty in regard to BTC’s value still exists, as was made clear in November when the price of the flagship cryptocurrency dipped by $3,000 within a span of just 24 hours. That being said, it is unfair to compare BTC, which is just over a decade old, to legacy systems that have been around for more than a hundred years.

So, it’s worth exploring the true meaning of the term “safe haven,” especially as the world struggles with COVID-19-induced financial destruction. CryptoYoda believes that while precious metals like gold and silver certainly are tangible stores of value, they are not very practical — i.e., they are difficult to store, transport, secure, etc. He added:

“I will always remain an advocate for precious metals as they are the ultimate stores of value and have been an accepted form of money for hundreds and thousands of years. It is difficult to store it all in Gold, and then it still needs to be protected and cannot be easily moved.”

O’Neill believes that while it may not be fair to compare Bitcoin to traditional stores of value, in recent times, the world’s leading cryptocurrency appears to be shouldering that expectation quite well. In his view, the digital-gold narrative is incredibly strong within the community, with a lot of people truly believing in the technology and actively working to make Bitcoin more valuable, whether by running nodes, mining, writing and reviewing code, or HODLing it.

Additionally, it’s also important to recognize how far Bitcoin has come in relation to various legacy financial systems, with an increasing number of mainstream investors now looking to enter the domain. Providing his insights on the matter, Yoni Assia, founder and CEO of eToro — a social trading and multiasset brokerage company — told Cointelegraph that crypto is no longer just the domain of computer programmers and fintech advocates, adding: “We expect this to continue into 2021 as fears of inflation continue to creep up globally.”

Crypto is not perfect, and that’s fine

While crypto stands to completely redefine the way in which the global financial ecosystem works, it still faces many pertinent issues that need to be ironed out. For example, over the first 10 months of 2020 alone, losses from cryptocurrency thefts, hacks and frauds amounted to a whopping $1.8 billion, according to blockchain forensics company CipherTrace. The company even suggested that 2020 was on track to record the second-highest value in losses linked to crypto crimes, exceeding $4.5 billion.

Furthermore, due to regulatory uncertainty, crypto continues to be used by certain sections of society as a means of tax evasion. For example, the United States Justice Department recently indicted John McAfee, an antivirus software creator and crypto proponent, accusing him of tax fraud worth millions of dollars linked to his crypto proceeds between 2014 to 2018. Furthermore, CryptoYoda believes that in its current state, the industry is far from perfect, adding:

“Scalability is a major issue. Similarly, state-level attacks pose another major risk, with such issues most likely rising as the industry grows from strength to strength. While the technology in itself is positioned well for such attacks, individuals are not. The greatest risk I see in this market is the forcing of KYC on every exchange and individual, which undermines the promise of cryptocurrency.”

That being said, fiat currencies are also used by criminals; however, in such scenarios, the “fiat is for criminals” argument is never drawn out. For example, according to a recent BBC report, HSBC allowed tech-savvy scamsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their ploy.

The leaked documents claim HSBC moved around $80 million through its U.S. business to its accounts in Hong Kong between 2013 and 2014. What’s even more surprising is that the endeavor kicked off right after the banking institution was fined a whopping $1.9 billion in the U.S. over money laundering charges. Other reports have also suggested that banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have too been implicated in moving some $2 trillion of “dirty money” between 1999 and 2017.

So, it seems that both the traditional and crypto worlds only manage to see the speck in their brother’s eye but not the log in their own. Furthermore, since there are fewer well-known advocates for crypto in comparison with traditional finance, it’s of no surprise that the aspiring blockchain sector is losing out on the media spin war. As a result, many common misconceptions continue to seep into the consciousness of the masses, ultimately damaging the perception and delaying the adoption of the technologies.",,https://inc42.com/buzz/bitcoin-price-slumps-6-but-crypto-players-say-bull-run-will-endure/,"Industry stakeholders have attributed the ongoing bull run to the interest shown by institutional investors in cryptocurrencies

Indian crypto stakeholders have said that despite periodic price corrections, the price of one Bitcoin will breach INR 1 Cr by 2030

Bitcoin is currently trading at over $22K. A little more than 24 hours ago, it was trading at a record high of around $24,298, before slumping around 6%

Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, is currently trading at over $22K. A little more than 24 hours ago, it was trading at a record high of $24,200, before slumping around 6%, as fears of a new Covid-19 strain in the United Kingdom gripped financial markets the world over.

While most crypto stakeholders assert that the price of Bitcoin isn’t punctuated by the sentiment in the financial markets, there have been events in the last few years where the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin have mirrored the movement of assets across wider markets.

Other popular but smaller cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple also fell 5.9% and 9.2% respectively.

Nevertheless, in conversations with Inc42, Indian crypto stakeholders have pointed out that investing in Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, also expressing optimism that despite periodic price corrections which are bound to happen with any asset class, the price of one Bitcoin could reach single-digit crores by 2030.

“At ZebPay, we encourage dollar-cost averaging — investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the asset class and sticking to your investment plan through the ups and downs. If you had invested INR 1,000 per month in Bitcoin since November 2019, you would have seen, on average, an 87% ROI (return on investment), with the present value being approximately INR 23,000,” said Vikram Rangala, chief marketing officer at ZebPay.

The surge in the price of Bitcoin is attributable to its strong fundamentals, as pointed out by Sumit Gupta, cofounder and CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange CoinDCX. Further, on May 11 this year, there was the third halving of Bitcoin, a supply shock event where every four years, the number of bitcoins mined on a single day gets cut in half.

“In the months after the previous two halvings, Bitcoin and the overall crypto market cap rose exponentially, and we are witnessing a start of a similar bull trend,” said Gupta.

Gupta added that institutional investors driving up the demand for Bitcoin could further ensure that there’d emerge a class of ultra-rich Bitcoin hoarders or whales, something that’s instrumental in ensuring that the price doesn’t fall as drastically as it has risen this year.

Many payment companies like PayPal, Square are integrating cryptocurrencies in their services due to the rising demand for crypto from retail investors. Recently, Massmutual, an insurance giant, moved into Bitcoin investments. Additionally, Alan Howard, billionaire hedge fund manager, is among the backers of a new institutional investment firm, called One River Asset Management, which is eyeing a $1 Bn investment in Bitcoin.

‘In the short term (for the year 2021) the price could range between INR 50 Lakhs – INR 1 Cr for one bitcoin, owing to, the Bitcoin halving and growing global institutional demand,” Gupta said.

Vikram Subburaj, cofounder and CEO of Chennai-headquartered Giottus Cryptocurrency Exchange, made similar observations.

“The UK-based Ruffer Investment, a recent example of investors looking to hedge their investment, had invested 2.7% of its AUM (assets under management) in Bitcoin this November. Even insurance companies like MassMutual, the Massachusetts insurance firm with $235 Bn in AUM, dipped its toes into Bitcoin with a $100 Mn purchase. With more players joining the bandwagon we will be noticing more price increases in the days to come,” Subburaj told Inc42.

Prices

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $22,672, a nearly 17% increase from last week’s price of $19,302. Its market cap was $419 Bn.

Ethereum was trading at $598, a 2.2% increase from last week’s price of $585. Its market cap was $67 Bn.

However, a reversal typically occurs once altcoins start to show such major weakness and altcoin traders are in depression. The leading indicator for such a U-turn is Ether (ETH), which is now in a do or die position against its BTC pair.

New higher high for ETH in first uptrend since bear market

The chart above speaks for itself, showing a new uptrend since the breakout above $300 earlier this year when buyers immediately stepped in this region. This was a breakout from a multi-year accumulation range, which increases the likelihood of bull market continuation.

Since then, Ether’s price broke through $450 and continued its rally toward the recent high at $675. If that becomes the temporary top, a correction towards $450-480 is likely. However, such a correction is very healthy for the markets and should provide fuel for the next impulse wave.

Using the Fibonacci extension tool, such an impulse wave could send ETH price to $900 and possibly even $1,300.

December is historically a good month to enter altcoins

BTC Dominance 1-week chart. Source: TradingView

Since 2016, the Bitcoin dominance chart has topped out in the month of December, followed by a solid quarter for altcoins.

In that perspective, the Bitcoin dominance shows a clear resistance zone at the 67%-69% level. It’s hard to call this a resistance zone as the Bitcoin dominance chart isn’t an asset that can be traded. But technical analysis can still be useful in this case.

If the dominance reverses here, then another lower high will be constructed resulting in another top for December.

Given that the cryptocurrency market is in a bull cycle for the first time since January 2018, the potential altcoin run may become relatively big in scope. Such a rally could also see Bitcoin dominance dro to 48%-50%.

ETH/BTC must bounce to show strength

The weekly chart for ETH/BTC tells the whole story. A breakout above the 0.026 sats earlier this year propelled the price even higher with Ether rallying toward 0.04 sats — the range resistance from the previous accumulation period. This resistance couldn’t break in one-go, after which ETH/BTC dropped significantly.

The primary point of interest now is the range between 0.0245-0.026 sats as that zone used to be the resistance. As long as this area holds, more upside should be expected in the first quarter of 2021.

However, altcoins do not perform well when Bitcoin is volatile. Therefore, Ether and altcoin traders should keep an eye on Bitcoin, which needs to stabilize and/or consolidate to ensure a strong breakout.

In a new edition of DataDash, Merten maps out to his 363,000 subscribers the levels to watch for BTC.

“We are in uncharted territory. This is a first for where Bitcoin is in its price history. So, we can see here right now that we’re holding generally around [$22,250]. You can see we dipped a little bit lower here but right now we’re roughly holding the support range we’ve had back here through December 17th to the 18th and it will be a question here whether we can maintain this level.

If we do start to curve back over here [$21,900], I would feel a bit of a warning sign’s coming out of the market; that we are going to dip down and do something that a lot of people don’t want to see and that’s a breakdown towards $20,000 or to the upper $19,000 range where the official all-time highs were previously from the last cycle to make it new support.”

Merten says that Bitcoin is already overextended and that we might see a shift in liquidity as investors rotate their profits into leading altcoins.

“Are we going to see altcoins start to see yet again altcoins start to take some of that market valuation, some of that liquidity, some of the market dominance? I really think that’s the case.”

The crypto strategist is looking at Ethereum (ETH/USD) and highlights that it is far from its all-time high.

“When I look at Ethereum, it’s in a much more healthy cycle. There’s not some absolute major overshoot. It’s not in its all-time highs.”

Merten also tracks the performance of Litecoin (LTC/USD) and notes. that the coin is maintaining its steady uptrend.

“Litecoin, holding up very healthily here. Nothing too crazy.”

Although the broader crypto market is currently going through a correction, Merten says that an altcoin season is in sight.

“What we saw back in the summer was not the altcoin cycle. We have yet to hit that altcoin cycle but we’re getting very, very close. We’ve had our precursor rallies in a lot of these altcoins and I can tell you all, you want to keep an eye on those major altcoins because some of them are starting to hold nicely.”

Merten emphasizes that LTC/BTC is trading near critical support at around 0.004 where it pumped 3x to 5x based on its historical price action. He’s also keeping a close watch on ETH/BTC which he says is also trading at a key support level.

“In this case, what we’ve got are discount opportunities where altcoins are really cheap right now. This is again where you see capital cycle in and out of different markets within the crypto space.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong",2020-12-22 00:00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets,"Under new proposed regulations from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, it may become much easier for the government to track bitcoin transactions. And while there’s currently a 15-day comment period open, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are calling foul because that period includes Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day.

The proposed regulations in question, which were filed at 4:20PM ET on December 18th, are about private wallets. Let’s say I am a famous and fancy cryptocurrency investor, and I do some trading on Coinbase. If I have my own private wallet that I want to transfer my money to, I will have to identify myself as the wallet’s owner if I’m sending more than $3,000 in a transaction. And if I want to do business with someone else who has a private wallet, I need to tell the exchange some pretty detailed personal information. The exchanges are then required to store records of all this and turn them over on request.

This new know-your-customer requirement is, at minimum, a complete pain in the ass

Also under the proposed regulation, an exchange would be required to report my personal information if I make a total of more than $10,000 in transactions in one day. You can see why Coinbase — or any other exchange — would see this new know-your-customer requirement, at minimum, as a complete pain in the ass.

It’s also the most ironic development in cryptocurrency’s ironic history; born from a weird group of the libertarians, anarchists, and utopians, cryptocurrency promised to be a way to transact absolutely privately, in a trustless system. Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, arose just after the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to banks — but these new regulations will make cryptocurrency exchanges act a lot more like banks. Taken in concert with another rule change about international transactions, it may signal that cryptocurrency’s wild years are over — and anonymity will be harder to find.

Cryptocurrency exchanges make it easy to move from dollars (or whatever) into a cryptocurrency and vice versa. That also means that they make cryptocurrency accessible to more people. The current FinCEN proposal makes more work for these exchanges and for the people operating within them as well as undermining the anonymity for which cryptocurrency is famous. Taken in combination with another recent proposed rule change about how to report cryptocurrency that crosses borders, you can see why some cryptocurrency enthusiasts are nervous.

Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created to ensure anonymity, would ensure exactly the opposite under these rules

There are some concrete consequences to this, the EFF points out. First, it makes anonymity more difficult in a transaction between a private wallet and one hosted by an exchange service. Second, the proposed legislation also makes it less appealing to have a private wallet.

But the third problem is the real kick in the ass: some cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, record all transactions publicly. That means if I am trading bitcoin into my private wallet from an exchange, I have to send a bunch of identifying information about that wallet, which is then potentially available to the US government. Because as soon as you know a specific wallet address is mine, you know every bitcoin transaction I have ever made with that wallet. This means “that the government may have access to a massive amount of data beyond just what the regulation purports to cover,” the EFF writes.

So bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created to ensure anonymity, would ensure exactly the opposite under these rules. Though, I suppose, with a little creativity, it’s possible to get around them; you simply create a wallet for the know-your-customer rules, then transfer your money from there into a second private wallet.

If this proposed bill passes, your withdrawals to your non-KYC'd address will take two transactions instead of one.

Meaningless? https://t.co/vcXD31GyJe — Eric Wall (@ercwl) December 18, 2020

Yesterday, Coinbase’s chief legal counsel, Paul Grewal, issued a response to FinCEN, complaining about the 15 day period for comments on this rule change: “FinCEN asked the public to provide comments in just 15 days, spanning Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day, in the middle of a global pandemic — leaving just a handful of actual working days for comments.”

Coinbase is asking for a 60 day review period — which is the norm. The shorter review period of just 15 days is because the Treasury Department says “significant national security imperatives” mean this has to move faster. It’s true that some cryptocurrency transactions are criminal — The Silk Road was a significant part of bitcoin’s history, after all. The proposed rule says that cryptocurrencies “facilitate international terrorist financing, weapons proliferation, sanctions evasion, and transnational money laundering,” among its laundry list of potential criminality.

But it’s hard to know how serious that is, since 60 days from now, cryptocurrency exchanges would be dealing with the Biden administration rather than the outgoing Trump administration. “There is no emergency here; there is only an outgoing administration attempting to bypass the required consultation with the public to finalize a rushed rule before their time in office is done,” Grewal wrote.

Regardless of the 15-day or 60-day period, it does seem like the Treasury Department is attempting to send a message to any would-be cypherpunks: you can’t beat the existing financial world — you can only join it.",2020-12-22 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-crypto-exchange-exmo-hacked-estimates-presume-platform-lost-10-5-million/,"UK Crypto Exchange Exmo Hacked, Estimates Presume Platform Lost $10.5 Million

U.K.-based cryptocurrency exchange Exmo detailed on December 21, 2020, the firm had “detected suspicious withdrawal activity” and halted withdrawals. Exmo said a security audit report revealed “large withdrawals” of bitcoin and five other cryptocurrencies. Analysts estimate that Exmo may have lost over $10 million from the hot wallet breach.

On Monday, the U.K.-registered digital currency trading platform Exmo disclosed it suffered a loss “some amounts of BTC, XRP, ZEC, USDT, ETC, and ETH.” According to the exchange, team members monitoring the hot wallets “spotted some large withdrawals” at approximately 2:27:02 UTC.

“The affected hot wallets comprise near 5% of the total assets. Let us stress that all the assets in the cold wallets are safe,” Exmo wrote in the security incident report.

The exchange added:

Most importantly, we want to assure you that if any user fund is affected by this incident, it will be covered completely by Exmo.

Exmo also provided a list of cryptocurrency addresses in the blog post and according to The Block’s research analyst, Igor Igamberdiev, the exchange lost roughly $10.5 million in digital assets. Exmo is asking digital currency services and exchanges to block the listed crypto addresses that are connected with the compromise.

The trading platform accounts for $43 million (1,890 BTC) in 24-hour trade volume according to market aggregators. Founded in 2013, Exmo claims to have 1.6 million registered users and roughly 50,000 daily traders.

At the moment, Exmo says the team is investigating the incident and will keep the address list updated.

Digital currency markets have seen some volatile action this week and during the last 24 hours following the XRP charges, a number of coins shed a great deal of value. At the time of publication, the entire crypto-economy is valued at $629 billion and because XRP lost so much value, bitcoin’s dominance index has risen above the 68% mark.

Just recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives. According to the U.S. regulator’s complaint, Ripple Labs “raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.” Since then, the price of XRP fell like a rock, losing nearly 40% during the last 24 hours of trading sessions since the SEC announcement. The XRP plunge has also tugged a number of other crypto-assets down as well during the trading sessions on December 23.

Bitcoin (BTC) on the other hand, has been doing well despite the regulatory action against Ripple Labs. BTC is currently swapping for $23,796 per coin and is up 1.5% during the last day. Seven-day stats show BTC has gained more than 11%, over 29% for the 30-day span, and 120% over the last three months of trading. BTC’s market dominance in comparison to the 7,500+ coins in existence is 68% today, which is higher than it has been in quite some time. Currently, out of the $629 billion crypto-economy market cap, BTC captures $442 billion.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading for $612 per ether and the token is down after taking some losses during the early morning trading sessions on Wednesday. ETH’s market cap is hovering at around $69 billion at the time of publication. Market statistics show that XRP is swapping for $0.33 per unit and is still down 30% since its initial fall. The market capitalization of XRP has plunged to $15.4 billion and the market is now below tether’s (USDT) overall valuation of over $20 billion.

Litecoin (LTC) has been hit far less than most of the other crypto assets in the economy today after the XRP announcement. LTC is swapping for $109 per coin and has a market cap of around $7.25 billion. The crypto asset LTC is still up over 20% during the last seven days of trading. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is down over 6% today and trading for $296 per unit at the time of publication. BCH has an overall market valuation of around $5.52 billion and the crypto asset is up 38% during the last 90 days.

While many analysts have been watching crypto markets very closely and waiting for a big correction or a higher rally. The trader Crediblecrypto told his 87,000 followers that he expects bitcoin (BTC) to climb higher before the next big correction. “I’m bullish on BTC here,” he tweeted. “I don’t think this is THE correction everyone is waiting for. That will come a bit later IMO.”

During the last 24 hours, onchain stats from Cryptoquant and Glassnode show a number of aggregated inflows to exchanges like Binance, Bithumb, and Gemini. Since the XRP announcement happened, Cryptoquant’s beta alerts on Telegram has been flashing the inflow signals.

However, Glassnode’s statistics from the weekly onchain report indicates that BTC’s “Reserve Risk” has been “extremely low despite the price passing its previous all-time high.” Glassnode’s report also discussed the crypto asset’s Entity-Adjusted SOPR downward correction.

“BTC’s recent downward correction in Entity-Adjusted SOPR was indeed a signal of an approaching upwards trend,” the report notes. “The downward trend has now reversed, suggesting that BTC’s sideways movement below $20k may be well and truly behind us, with new support levels staying above $23k for the time being.”

Meanwhile, XRP took the brunt of the losses during the last day and the digital currency faces delisting as well. For instance, the Hong Kong trading platform OSL had suspended XRP trading and the U.S. crypto exchange Beaxy is doing so as well. The sale of unregistered securities renders Ripple and the XRP cryptocurrency legally dubious and therefore puts Beaxy’s users at risk,” the exchange said on Wednesday morning. “In a constantly evolving regulatory landscape, Beaxy Exchange strives to adjust to developments as rapidly as possible.”

Beaxy’s Head of Operations, Naeem Master further stated:

The SEC and Ripple Labs have been debating XRP’s legal status for years. So the news of SEC charges against Ripple are not unexpected. That being said, Beaxy Exchange has an obligation to operate with regulatory compliance as a priority. In this case, that means halting all trading of XRP on Beaxy.

While some crypto assets have felt the brunt of the XRP storm, a number of digital currencies have done well. Peerplays (PPY) has gained 198%, zilliqa (ZIL) jumped 16%, and populous (PPT) is up over 14% today. XRP suffered the most losses, but coins like golem (GNT -19%), time new bank (TNB -17%), mossland (MOC -17%), and iot chain (ITC -16%) saw decent percentage losses as well.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a Bitcoin holding company, has $13.1 billion assets under management (AUM) and is valued at more than $18 billion in OTC markets.

Key Takeaways JPMorgan strategists say that investor inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust are ""too big"" for Bitcoin price correction.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a publicly traded statutory trust in OTC markets with substantial holdings of the cryptocurrency.

The trust provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin, but investment into the trust comes with significant riders and risks.

JPMorgan's strategists write that the inflows into GBTC ""are too big to allow any position unwinding by momentum traders to create sustained negative price dynamics."" In other words, investor enthusiasm for GBTC shares is a determinant of Bitcoin's price trajectory, and other Bitcoin traders do not possess sufficient market share or Bitcoin holdings to influence a correction in the cryptocurrency’s price.

It is difficult to gauge the extent to which GBTC influences Bitcoin prices (or vice versa) because there is little transparency to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The thin liquidity of the cryptocurrency's markets also adds to the problem. What is certain, however, is that GBTC shares benefit from a rise in Bitcoin price, enabling it to purchase more of the cryptocurrency for its holdings.

Bitcoin price has skyrocketed to new records recently on the back of macroeconomic instability and solid moves by institutional investors to explore or move into cryptocurrency markets. Analysts have predicted a price correction but have not specified a time frame for the event.

What Is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?

According to Bitcointreasuries.org, a site that tracks Bitcoin holdings for publicly traded investment trusts and firms, GBTC holds 572,644 Bitcoin, or approximately 50% of the 1,150,622 Bitcoin in circulation at these ventures. About 18.6 million Bitcoin have been mined so far, and GBTC holds roughly 3.1% of the asset.

The trust company has reported an impressive array of statistics regarding investor inflows into its product since the beginning of this year. For example, its AUM jumped from $2 billion last December to $5.9 billion this past August, before shooting up to the current $13.1 billion figure. JPMorgan's strategists estimate that GBTC is adding assets at a rapid clip of $1 billion per month.

For institutional investors and hedge funds, GBTC is a convenient vehicle to gain indirect exposure to a volatile asset, without paying the associated costs such as custody. They can move into a Bitcoin trade when its price is on an upswing and exit when it drops.

For example, investment firm Guggenheim Partners has reserved the right to invest up to 10% from one of its funds into GBTC. The arrangement has several upsides for Guggenheim to profit from Bitcoin's soaring price and not much downside since it does not have to purchase or own the cryptocurrency. GBTC's organization as a trust adds tax benefits to the Bitcoin trade.

However, those benefits come at a hefty premium to the Bitcoin price. During the 2017 bull run in cryptocurrency prices, GBTC shares traded at a 100% premium to the actual spot price of Bitcoin at crypto exchanges. GBTC's shares also often mimic the volatile price movements of its holding asset. This year alone, the trust's share price is up by 238% in OTC markets.

Finally, the trust's complicated setup – its shares are created in private placement transactions in primary markets and subsequently traded in public OTC markets – means that private investors can offload their shares at a premium in public markets, regardless of the underlying asset's actual worth. For example, if the trust creates fewer shares in the private market and demand skyrockets due to surging Bitcoin prices, then traders in the OTC market will have to pay unrealistic premiums to own Bitcoin through GBTC.",2020-12-23 16:47:14.948000+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/notorious-crypto-figures-arrested-in-2020,"Over the past year, many prominent and colorful crypto personalities have been apprehended and arrested. From the jailing of antivirus pioneer John McAfee to the laying of charges against executives from one of the world’s largest exchanges, 2020 didn’t exactly shake off crypto’s reputation as a honeypot for criminals.

Over the first 10 months of 2020, blockchain forensics company CipherTrace estimates that losses from thefts, hacks and frauds totaled a whopping $1.8 billion, a figure fueled in part by the rise of various DeFi platforms.

The report suggests that 2020 is on track to record the second-highest value in losses linked to cryptocurrency crimes, trailing 2019, when proceeds of those crimes exceeded $4.5 billion.

Let’s take a closer look at some of the highest-profile figures embroiled in legal issues this year.

Arthur Hayes goes missing following DoJ charges

On Oct. 1, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal charges against BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, as well as three of his associates for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Compounding their problems, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Hayes and his company for flouting AML regulations.

The Hong Kong resident has been missing in action in public since and is yet to resurface. But in a stroke of good fortune for Hayes, he might not be compelled to face the music anytime soon, as the U.S. and Hong Kong have suspended their extradition agreements in light of the recent political turmoil there.

The DoJ alleged that BitMEX had been engaged in a variety of shady activities and had weak Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies that could easily be misused by third-party actors.

BitMEX was also accused of operating a complex international corporate structure, with offices in premium international destinations such as New York and Hong Kong while claiming to be registered and based out of Seychelles.

After the news broke, BitMEX announced the departure of Hayes as the company CEO, along with chief technical officer Samuel Reed and the head of business development Greg Dwyer.

“Star” Xu’s mysterious absence, explained

Prominent cryptocurrency exchange OKEx copped a lot of flak after it suspended crypto withdrawals on Oct. 16, effectively barring customers from taking out their crypto holdings.

Reports surfaced that the suspension was related to the exchange’s Chinese co-founder Mingxing “Star” Xu being arrested by local authorities — although the exchange vigorously denied that was the issue.

After being unreachable for more than 30 days, Xu finally made a media appearance on WeChat on Nov. 19. He revealed that he’d been assisting relevant authorities investigating OK Group’s “backdoor listing in 2017,” in which the exchange had sought to partner with an “undisclosed third-party entity” to make its offerings available to clients all over the world. Xu indicated that after having looked at his prior business engagements, investigators had finally clarified the matter and given him the all-clear.

After a month, OKEx finally reenabled crypto withdrawals on Nov 27.

John McAfee’s Spanish cruise comes to an abrupt end

Tech savant, crypto evangelist and eccentric millionaire John McAfee has been leading the crypto hype train for what feels like time immemorial now. In 2017, he famously proclaimed that within 36 months, Bitcoin would hit a price of $1 million or he’d “eat my d--- on national television.” He retracted his statement earlier this year to the relief of most people.

McAfee was detained in Barcelona by local authorities in October regarding tax evasion charges levied by the U.S. government against him. He was also charged over fraudulently promoting a series of questionable cryptocurrency projects, from which he allegedly profited millions of dollars.

Prosecutors claim that McAfee failed to file his tax returns for four years running, even while he raked in millions of dollars from his consulting work, speaking engagements, digital currency investments, etc. According to a statement released by the U.S. Justice Department, McAfee illegally siphoned his income from various bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of different nominees. He is also accused of not declaring a number of expensive assets, including a yacht and real estate.

This is not the first time McAfee has been in trouble with the law. Back in 2012, his name was linked with the death of his neighbor, Florida businessman Gregory Faull. In 2019, he was ordered to pay $25 million in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the estate, but refused, saying:

“I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits in the past 11 years.”

If convicted of the new charges, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

Santiago Fuentes’ billion-dollar scheme collapses

Spanish national Santiago Fuentes was the operator of a cryptocurrency arbitrage firm called Arbistar that had tens of thousands of users investing Bitcoin (BTC) into its arbitrage trading bot. Blockchain investigations firm Tulip Research reported that since its inception, the firm had raised more than $1 billion in Bitcoin.

Suspicions arose in September when Fuentes claimed that due to a “digital error,” Arbistar’s native trading module had been somehow disabled, wiping out more than a quarter of the company’s funds overnight.

In the course of their investigations, Spanish authorities determined that Fuentes had been making use of his crypto outfit to allegedly facilitate various financial frauds and to launder money. Tulip Research traced back some of Arbistar’s withdrawal activity to a deep-web marketplace called Hydra.

Fuentes was arrested in October and has been charged with financial fraud and money laundering. On Dec. 13, lawyers representing 130 former clients said they’d lost 4 million euros ($4.86M) among them, with Spanish media suggesting that in total, 32,000 people had lost 93.4 million euros ($113.5M).

Matthew Piercey’s daring sea scooter escape

The 44-year-old Shasta County, California man was arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on Nov 16. while trying to flee from authorities using a sea scooter.

Local media outlets reported that Piercey was able to evade agents for over an hour by first speeding off in a truck and then abandoning the vehicle on the edge of Lake Shasta, where he used a sea scooter — an underwater mobile device that can typically reach a maximum speed of 4 mph — to continue to evade police underwater for 25 minutes. He was arrested when he emerged.

Police allege that Piercey solicited $35 million for crypto mining and other investments through Family Wealth Legacy LLC and Zolla Financial LLC.

The two firms reportedly targeted wealthy investors, obtaining a minimum of $50,000 from each client. However, Piercey reportedly admitted that he had little to no understanding of cryptocurrencies.

He reportedly spent $2.5 million of the obtained money via his schemes on renovating two of his homes and paying off his credit card bills. He is now currently facing multiple charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering and witness-tampering. If found guilty, Piercey could face life in prison.

Harpreet Singh Sahni is brought down by Indian sleuths

Over the years, Sydney-based socialite and concert promoter Harpreet Sahni had built a reputation as a man who regularly rubbed shoulders with Australia’s elites, including ex-Prime Ministers Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard, former Premier of New South Wales Mike Baird, and former cricketer Glenn McGrath.

But in October, Indian police authorities claimed that Sahni and his close aides had allegedly swindled around $50 million from clients. He was promoting a scheme called “Plus Gold Union Coin” (PGUC), which promised to deliver profits ranging between $5,000 and $8,000 per day to backers.

Investors who tipped around $7,000 in PGUC were told they could potentially rake in more than $100,000 within a year. Investors had to lock into a 12-month contract during which they couldn’t cash out their crypto holdings. However, as PGUC’s popularity grew, token holders began to grow suspicious.

The PGUC website would go offline for weeks at a time and when the currency plummeted, there was no way for investors to minimize their losses or withdraw their assets. The invested money — estimated to be around $50 million — disappeared, with all correspondence stopped with clients.

Sahni now faces roughly 24 years in prison and is awaiting his sentencing.

Conor Freeman’s million-dollar Bitcoin ploy

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified Dublin-based IT professional Conor Freeman as the man behind a theft involving more than $2 million worth of crypto. He was arrested by Homeland Security officials on Nov. 16 and forced to hand over more than 142 Bitcoin.

Freeman was reportedly working with a group able to gain access to the email addresses and phone numbers of victims via various social media platforms. They also had contacts inside the telecom industry who enabled them to initiate sophisticated SIM-swap attacks.

That’s where a scam artist is able to obtain a SIM card that is directly linked to their victim’s mobile number, enabling them to gain access to an individual’s 2FA messages and one-time passwords that are used to validate identities and approve larger financial transactions.

Freeman pleaded guilty to stealing cryptocurrencies worth $1.92 million from Emmy award-winner Seth Shapiro — producer of Game Changers and The Chosen One — as well as illegally obtaining an additional $250,000 from two other victims, Michael Templeman and Darran Marble.

The entire PlusToken team

Earlier this year in July, Chinese police took 109 people into custody in connection with the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. Among them, 27 were allegedly the scheme’s masterminds — including Chen Bo, Luu Jianghua, Lu Jianghua, Lu Qinghai, Jin Xinghai, Wang Yin and Zhang Qin — while the remaining 82 people arrested held smaller roles within the organization.

The PlusToken scam raked in an estimated $5.7 billion from more than 2 million investors. Based out of China, the project presented itself as being a cryptocurrency wallet that provided high returns if users purchased PLUS tokens with either BTC or Ether (ETH).

In 2019, key members moved large amounts of crypto out of the platform, with 25,000 BTC sent to various addresses, including Bitcoin mixers between February and March, and in June, 789,534 ETH was transferred from the firm’s coffers. However, by the end of the year, the entire scheme had been exposed, and by July 2020, the project had been taken down by Chinese police.

In November, the Jiangsu Yancheng Intermediate People’s Court revealed that authorities had confiscated 194,775 BTC, 833,083 ETH, 487 million XRP, 79,581 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 1.4 million Litecoin (LTC), 27.6 million EOS, 74,167 Dash, 6 billion Dogecoin (DOGE) and 213,724 Tether (USDT) — estimated to be worth $4 billion. Earlier this month, Chen Bo and 13 of his co-conspirators were sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 11 years.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/12/170566-bitcoin-btc-remains-single-most-watched-digital-asset-with-ethereum-dominating-defi-throughout-2020-report/,"As 2020 comes to an end, Binance has shared some key crypto and blockchain industry trends and highlights for this year.

The exchange notes that the total market cap for all digital currencies surged by over 3.3x in 2020 alone, expanding the crypto-assets market significantly. Binance pointed out that the number of institutional clients on its platform has grown by nearly 50% since the end of last year. Institutions are entering the digital assets sector at a “historic rate,” the exchange claims.

While sharing other important developments, Binance revealed that total trading volumes across its platforms “reached $3 trillion USDT, our highest yet.” The report from Binance added that interest in Bitcoin (BTC) surged after its recent Q4 2020 price rally, and it “remained the single most-watched crypto-asset” on the world’s largest crypto trading platform. The leading spot and futures trading pairs on Binance were BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, the exchange confirmed.

The report added:

“DeFi innovations like liquidity mining, yield farming, and crypto lending provided new ways of earning passive income, with Binance Savings attracting the most users out of all financial management products on Binance.”

This year, the global capital markets faced “unprecedented” volatility, while “the economic recovery in many countries has been K-shaped, delivering a financial blow to already-vulnerable communities,” the report noted. It also mentioned that “with traditional financial systems under stress, retail users and institutions turned to cryptocurrencies en masse, driving the crypto markets to new heights.”

A separate report from Coin Metrics notes that on March 12, 2020, the world “abruptly changed.” It pointed out that “amidst growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin suffered one of its largest one-day price drops in history.” The rest of the digital asset market followed, with most major cryptocurrencies being down more than 30% that week, the Coin Metrics report confirmed.

The report further noted:

“The crash [in March 2020] was exacerbated by a BitMEX liquidation spiral that temporarily sent Bitcoin below $4,500. From March 12th 9AM to March 13th 6AM UTC, long positions worth 1.1B contracts (one contract represents a $1 position) were liquidated. As liquidations mounted and liquidity waned, BitMEX’s auto-deleveraging engine kicked in, causing Bitcoin price to plummet to below $4,500. Price kept dropping until BitMEX suffered a reported DDOS attack that made it nearly impossible to trade on the exchange. In hindsight, March 13th marked the floor for BTC’s price in 2020.”

Unlike many of the other digital asset market crashes, this particular crash was directly associated or linked to “changing global conditions,” Coin Metrics’ report noted.

The report also mentioned that markets across the globe crashed along with the cryptocurrency markets as investors frantically began pulling funds out in “a rapid rush to safety.” Because of these moves, the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 “shot up to historic highs.” It was a major historic turning point during which “the world’s perception of Bitcoin would change as well,” Coin Metrics’ report noted.

Early Q2 2020 also saw the introduction of the CARES Act, which committed $2 trillion to the COVID-19 response, including stimulus checks that were paid out to many US households. Because of this massive money printing, the US M2 money stock increased from around $15 trillion to approximately $19 trillion over the course of this year, the report confirmed.

In May 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) underwent its third halving. According to Coin Metrics, the timing “couldn’t have been better.” The report noted that after fiat currencies began undergoing the “great inflation,” Bitcoin’s supply issuance began effectively decreasing, “towards less annual inflation.” However, the BTC halving wasn’t “some response decided on by the Bitcoin community, or a central bank,” the report clarified. It claimed that “the wheels were set into motion many years earlier and built into Bitcoin’s core.”

In addition to the rising Bitcoin price, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has grown dramatically this year (from only $1 billion in total value locked in DeFi contracts to over $10 billion). The report from Coin Metrics pointed out that “after bottoming out in October 2020, DeFi has started to rebound and is back at similar levels to September 2020.” The report further noted that DeFi “continues to grow and mutate as experimentation continues.” It added that “with new money flowing into BTC and ETH, new DeFi tokens and applications may be soon to follow.”

While sharing other key Bitcoin-related developments, Coin Metrics noted:

“On October 8th, Square announced a $50M investment into bitcoin, stating ‘we believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future.’ Square joined MicroStrategy and others in allocating part of their corporate treasury to bitcoin. On October 21st, PayPal made an official announcement that it was introducing “a way for customers to buy, hold, and sell certain cryptocurrencies within the PayPal wallet.”

In November 2020, billionaire investors Bill Miller and Stanley Druckenmiller also joined in, publicly confirming that they “held and recommended” Bitcoin as an investment. Both investors compared the flagship cryptocurrency to gold, with Miller noting that he believes “inflation is coming back due to the Federal Reserve gunning the money supply.” A Citibank analyst has also predicted that BTC may reach $300K+ and referred to the digital asset as “21st century gold” in a leaked note to clients.

Coin Metrics’ report added:",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/the-biden-administration-can-change-the-world-with-new-crypto-regulations/,"The U.S. government is failing us with regard to fintech and blockchain regulation.

Devoid of any regulatory framework in the past four years we’ve been operating in limbo when it comes to the development and advancement of crypto products. Innovators in the fintech and blockchain industries have the ability and vision to build products that solve real problems for everyone from individuals to large banks to governments, but without a clear path forward, these products are unable to grow and scale to their full potential.

Regulation shouldn’t be a guessing game. Since 2019, when the Securities and Exchange Commission declared that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ethereum (ETH) are securities, the industry’s been at a standstill. Without clarity, blockchain innovation will be limited to just two coins — the industry is much larger than this. A lack of regulation stifles the immense potential that crypto and blockchain provide.

If we know the rules of the game we’re playing, we can keep doing what we do best: innovating.

A new administration presents a new opportunity for elected officials across the political spectrum to develop clear policies and regulations enabling banks, fintechs and corporations to custody and use crypto to improve efficiencies and to provide a better customer experience.

We can learn a lesson from recent history here. In 1991, we saw the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act (HPCCA), a bipartisan effort led by Senator Al Gore and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.

This legislation paved the way for companies like Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, Google and others to boom and made the U.S. an early internet leader. By 1993 we saw the introduction of web browsers, and shortly after, the start of the dot-com era in 1994 that cemented the U.S. as a symbol of innovation.

The browser changed everything. It’s created new jobs, new economic opportunities and new categories in technology that we couldn’t have predicted 30 years ago. In looking at the top 100 Fortune 500 companies in 1991, technology was barely a blip on the radar with IBM standing as the lone tech company. By 2020, it’s a drastically different picture, with the list completely dominated by technology giants like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Salesforce.

Technology companies in the top 100 have contributed close to three million jobs, with many leading in market value. Despite an unconventional year, we’ve continued to see successful technology IPOs like DoorDash, Snowflake, Asana and Palantir.

Products and services that we take for granted now like Google, the iPhone, Uber, Salesforce, Spotify, Postmates and more were made possible by the HPCCA. We now have another chance to create a bipartisan effort focused on crypto innovation, one with public and private sector support to ensure clear regulatory frameworks. Regulation will make it easier for innovators to create new products that keep the United States competitive with other countries and attract more investment.

There’s no disputing that the adoption of crypto and blockchain is on the rise. Major companies including PayPal, Square and Robinhood are leaning in to crypto and pushing it to the mainstream. With the validation from these brands, interest in the utility of cryptocurrencies and the ability of crypto to better serve businesses and their customers, continues to grow.

Leading crypto companies such as Ripple, Coinbase, Gemini, DCG and Chainalysis are currently based in the United States. However, unclear regulation will keep new entrepreneurs from innovating in the United States. While other countries move forward with defined regulatory frameworks, it’s possible that we will see new entrepreneurs and companies forgo setting up shop in the U.S. in favor of jurisdictions where the rules are clear.

If we know the rules of the game we’re playing, we can keep doing what we do best: innovating. We are only at the beginning — developers can build on open-source technologies, entrepreneurs can launch new companies and develop new products, and investors can invest in those companies.

We want the most innovative crypto and blockchain companies to be built and to grow here in the U.S., where they can create value and opportunities for U.S. citizens. Similar to the early days of the internet, we don’t know what the industry will look like in 5-10 years, but with flexible frameworks the opportunity is massive.

There’s a big opportunity for the Biden administration to influence new policies and new legislation and provide clear guidance that will accelerate innovation in fintech and crypto for many generations to come. The administration can:

Create a national digital banking licensing charter (similar to Singapore’s Digital Banking Charter), to streamline the process for fintechs to apply for crypto, lending and payments licensing. Today companies in the U.S. are left to apply state-by-state for licensing, which costs millions of dollars in legal fees and years to accomplish.

Define clear classifications for digital assets, derivatives (created via smart contracts) and stablecoins.

Create a bipartisan public and private sector group led by tech-savvy thought leaders such as Andrew Yang, to collaborate on landmark legislation that will do for fintech what the HPCCA did for internet companies.

Appoint an SEC chair that understands how to truly advance innovation while protecting consumers and the markets. The pro-innovation lip service we have been getting from this SEC is just that — lip service. Every crypto project this SEC has touched has ended up fleeing the U.S., in bankruptcy or left holding worthless tokens.

Regardless of how policymakers and regulators decide to approach the issues that our industry faces, we need to continue to work alongside the government to ensure that the rapidly growing number of people who use fintech and blockchain products continue to get the best-in-class solutions with appropriate consumer and market protections in place.

It’s clear that this technology is here to stay, and I hope that elected leaders will recognize the power that it has to effect massive financial industry progress. Similar to the HPCAA, smart regulation can both protect our consumers and markets while allowing proud U.S. companies to create life-changing innovations.",2020-12-23 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/why-im-long-crypto-short-dlt,"I had a remarkably good year as an industry analyst – a term I prefer to “expert.” Almost no one in crypto is an expert, to be fair. So many things change every month.

Last October, after the end of a rather enjoyable and intense journey with ConsenSys, where I spent most of my time talking Ethereum to financial institutions, it was painfully obvious to me the future of blockchain technology wasn’t in private permissioned ledgers. On the positive side, it was also very clear the institutional fear and resistance to public permissionless networks and crypto was starting to fall apart. So I took a sharp left turn from so-called enterprise blockchain into crypto and ended up doing some very useful work on contract with crypto startups like CDG, and then Binance and Paxful – two of the world’s largest crypto firms.

This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.

It was a good call. Being at the intersection of “tradfi” and crypto and having worked deeply in both spaces has given me a rare perspective on the dialectic between the twin forces of cypherpunk revolution and Wall Street’s resistance. I will tell this story of megatrends with links to my articles that have proven particularly prescient this year and will likely stand the test of 2021 as well.

Long open internet, short consortium

Just before bitcoin and ethereum started a very sharp rise, I wrote an article challenging Chris Skinner, a close friend who is one of the world’s foremost fintech experts. I argued that even though crypto was still fringe, this fringe was now big enough to start a snowball. Chris and I eventually agreed this blockchain wasn’t the same “private DLT” that consultants (like me once) were pushing on banks and enterprise clients but a compelling technology and actual source of technological innovation in the internet. [FYI, if Chris calls something in fintech, that thing usually happens.]

Long India, short crypto ban

After ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin’s famous “one million devs” talk at last year’s Ethereum developer conference, I had tweet–asked how Ethereum would get to one million devs without India, which is one of the world’s largest pools of developers in any area of technology.

It turns out when all of us in the West were all worrying about India’s crypto ban, developers and entrepreneurs in India were building some really cool pieces of crypto technology exemplified by projects like Matic Network, Marlin Protocol, Instadapp and Razor Network (Disclosure: I have a small investment in Razor and Marlin and I hold a small amount of Matic). Meanwhile some of the best investors in the space including Arjun Balaji of Paradigm, Avichal Garg of Electric Capital and Binance Chairman Changpeng “CZ” Zhao had started investing in India’s crypto ecosystem and bitcoin buyers had started popping up on peer-to-peer bitcoin platforms like Paxful.

This is why, in my CoinDesk article, I declared India’s Supreme Court decision to unwind the crypto ban a victory for the entire crypto ecosystem. As of today, if you are a crypto investor,and you are not investing in India, you are going to live to regret it.

Long Polkadot, short 'eth killers'

(Full disclosure: Most of my crypto net worth [otherwise known as bags] is in ethereum, I am a small time Eth 2.0 staker and I don’t hold much Polkadot or Kusama at all – yet.]

In a popular YouTube interview with SwissBorgs Alex Fazel this year, I bravely declared Polkadot the likely Ethereum disruptor as of today. I argued that not only had Gavin Wood contributed seminal ideas to Ethereum 2.0, he had also witnessed firsthand how the Ethereum developer community was built and in my humble opinion, “he knew exactly what he’s doing.”

See also: Ajit Tripathi – Banks Need to Adopt Crypto, Now

At the risk of upsetting my fellow Ethereum old-timers, I think of Polkadot as Eth 2.0 without the technical debt and much more clarity in terms of vision and technical roadmap. If you ask dapp developers today, what Polkadot is missing is the rich set of developer tools that ConsenSys built to power the Ethereum ecosystem. In a sense, Polkadot is missing its own ConsenSys – a venture studio to invest in developer tools and infrastructure. This hasn’t stopped Polkadot from becoming the second most popular blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) already and, if Polkadot finds its own portfolio of powerful dev tools, it’s going to be a very close contest.

Conversely, Ethereum can sustain its lead by taking occasional steps back from open-ended research and providing more architectural clarity to its core constituency – dapp and DeFi developers sooner rather than later. The Ethereum Foundation is doing really well by encouraging innovation in layer 2 protocols to enable optimisations for different non functional parameters. Layer 2 protocols, a leading-edge developer toolset and network effects could preserve Ethereum’s lead, but it’s far from a done deal right now.

Long parachains, short prop chains

It amazes me that some of the biggest winners in crypto still don’t want to get the joke about the internet. Without naming any particular countries, entities or individuals, there’s no end to really smart, wealthy and powerful people trying to launch their own blockchains, their own stacks, their own smart contracting languages and thus their own vertically integrated crypto ecosystems they can own and control. Essentially, too many champions of crypto want to be the epicenter of decentralization. It’s only funny because it’s true.

These are smart people, and in an unregulated, short-termist environment, historically, it’s been possible to launch your own vertically integrated crypto ecosystems extremely profitably. Further, as Vitalik famously described in his “trilemma,” every blockchain ends up being optimized for one set of problems at the expense of another. This has led to building simple distributed ledgers to improve transaction throughput (Ripple), CS professors building throughput–optimized chains (Avalanche and Algorand), engineers building complex compute scalable chains (Solana), centralized notaries to provide transaction data sharing (Corda). The latter problem of “one size does not fit all” is something Polkadot will look to solve with Parachains and Ethereum 2.0 will look to solve with sharding and (maybe) sidechains.

Too many champions of crypto want to be the epicenter of decentralization. It’s only funny because it’s true.

The history of the internet does not repeat but it rhymes. At some point, I don’t foresee a chaotic multi–blockchain world. I see a “parachain” and “mainnet” world – blockchains built on a shared set of standards and rules, no matter what it’s called, will interconnect. The internet of value will be built on organized chaos and proprietary “my blockchain is better than yours” architectures such as enterprise DLTs and Hedera Hashgraph will fall away for lack of connectivity and developer adoption.

Long correlation, short diversification

My day job at Binance involved building fiat on-ramps – something for which my training with banks and PwC made me a particularly good fit. This gave me an insider’s view of how rapidly the attitudes of mainstream (fiat) fintech were changing. In 2017, I had witnessed U.K. “high street” banks refuse bank accounts for Coinbase firsthand (which they certainly regret), and in 2020 electronic money institutions and banks were suddenly quite keen to work with all the major crypto exchanges.

Long Satoshi, short Saylor

As of today, if you are a senior executive at a bank, hedge fund or asset manager and you do not have a crypto strategy, you are making your board very unhappy indeed. A worrying inference I haven’t mentioned before is that the entry of funds and corporate treasuries will increase its correlation with other risks on assets like equities, eliminating one of bitcoin’s biggest value propositions for institutions – diversification.

Bitcoin, like Apple, is a multi-hundred-billion dollar brand but as professor Scott Galloway argues in his brilliant book “Post Corona,” we live in the age of products where the product has to live up to the narrative of the brand. The narrative around bitcoin has shifted nearly every year with the digital gold narrative finally sticking with the likes of Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey, in part due to the relentless money printing by Western governments.

See also: Ajit Tripathi – Bitcoin Is Good for PayPal, but Is PayPal Good for Bitcoin?

At some point, the novelty value of crypto assets for PayPal and CashApp customers will wear off, the bear market will set in, average consumers will lose money and CashApp’s customer engagement numbers driven by bitcoin will drop as it has with Tinder, Facebook, Instagram and everything else that’s new and gamified.

The only way Dorsey can fulfil his vision for bitcoin is by investing in the technology that shifts the “GODL” narrative back to Satoshi’s original “P2P internet cash” narrative. The world needs internet money that facilitates censorship-resistant instant cross-border consumer payments. It does not need digital gold or gamified money if it’s a commodity cornered by a few early institutional whales or if it becomes more and more correlated with the stock market over time.

Long dapps, short fat protocols

Historically, the crypto playbook has been to compete with bitcoin and print undifferentiated “Burning Man” money. This is done by launching your own blockchain with protocol tokens, making the number go up with marketing, supply management, community building and building a loyal following of consumers who couldn’t care less about the technology or utility.

This is also partly because dapps weren’t really that useful until now. DeFi dapps like Aave and Uniswap have changed all that. These dapps are now extremely useful for the crypto aware, with monthly average users and volumes climbing continuously. Crypto is not just coins, marketing and fat protocols anymore. Further, so far there hasn’t really been a Web3 real economy, but it is now starting to come online with non–fungible token and gaming token marketplaces like Gemini’s Nifty Gateway.

This sharp increase in utility of dapps is a tipping point and a small preview of the future that lies ahead. The next bull run will not belong to bitcoin or fat protocols. As blockchains start to converge towards a “parachain” or “sharded” future, the next bull run in 2025 will belong to decentralized applications and it will be at the dot.com scale.

Kevin O'Leary told CNBC on Thursday bitcoin is irrelevant to financial markets and at risk of regulation.

His comments come as an increasing number of institutions like Guggenheim and SkyBridge capital invest millions into the cryptocurrency, driving a rally of over 200% in 2020.

""I'm waiting for the day that one of these regulators comes down hard on bitcoin. Grown men are going to weep when that happens. You'll never see a loss of capital like that ever in your life. It will be brutal,"" he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is proposing new regulation that would require certain cryptocurrency traders to provide more information about their identities and cryptocurrency transactions.

Kevin O'Leary told CNBC on Thursday that bitcoin is irrelevant to financial markets and too at risk of regulations to be taken seriously by institutional investors.

""Is this a nothing burger? It's not even a single cell amoeba,"" the O'Shares chairman said,

""I love to talk about it, it's fun to watch it go up and down, but during the day, when the bell rings, I don't talk to anybody that's worried about this. They do not put capital to work in bitcoin.""

His comments come as more institutional players are piling in, validating bitcoin's legitimacy as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Earlier this week, SkyBridge Capital invested $25 million into a new bitcoin fund, while last month, Guggenheim filed to reserve the right for 10% of its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund to invest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

O'Leary said that the concept of a digital currency will likely come to fruition in the future, but investors should be careful glorifying bitcoin while it has yet to fulfill a defined role in financial markets and while it could still be regulated. This year, bitcoin has skyrocketed over 200%, and many crypto bulls are forecasting an explosion of growth in 2021.

Though regulations could be coming for the popular token. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is proposing new rules that would require certain cryptocurrency traders to provide more information about their identities and cryptocurrency transactions. This doesn't appear to have scared off various institutional investors, but O'Leary, who said he has $52.77 in a crypto wallet, is more worried.

""I'm waiting for the day that one of these regulators comes down hard on bitcoin. Grown men are going to weep when that happens. You'll never see a loss of capital like that ever in your life. It will be brutal,"" he said.

O'Leary added: ""This whole market, even if Bitcoin were to go up, another 2000% is completely irrelevant to the institutional client.""

In November, Hong Kong’s government announced plans to ban retail cryptocurrency trading as part of a broader money laundering crackdown.

According to the South China Morning Post on Dec. 24, the proposed crypto regulations could also extend to Bitcoin automated teller machines.

In a consultation paper published in November, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau revealed that it also had plans to regulate Bitcoin ATMs. Data from CoinAtmRadar shows Hong Kong is home to 62 Bitcoin ATMs.

Speaking to SCMP, Leo Weese, co-founder of the association, argued against the proposed crypto regulations, stating:

“To restrict retail individuals from accessing Bitcoin would be overshooting the government’s goals of promoting innovation, and financial inclusion.”

If passed, the new regulatory regime would significantly expand the city’s crypto licensing architecture. Currently, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission only mandates registration for exchanges that list crypto securities or futures products.

Earlier in December, Fidelity-backed digital assets platform OSL was officially licensed by the Hong Kong SFC. The news finalized the SFC’s previous announcement in August agreeing in principle at the time to issue OSL a license pending a vetting process.

The proposed laws also echo some of the stricter mandates in place in mainland China where crypto trading is prohibited. Hong Kong is home to several major crypto trading services including Bitfinex and FTX, with others like OKEx and Huobi maintaining regional offices in the territory.",,https://www.ai-cio.com/news/sec-lawsuit-ripple-rattle-crypto-exchanges/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a civil lawsuit against cryptocurrency firm Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives, alleging they illegally raised nearly $1.4 billion in an unregistered offering of its digital asset XRP. Ripple’s XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

According to the SEC’s complaint, Ripple co-founder and former CEO Christian Larsen, and current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse raised capital to finance the company’s business through the sale of XRP digital assets in an unregistered securities offering to investors.

Ripple also allegedly distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-cash consideration, such as labor and market-making services. According to the complaint, the XRP sales also affected personal unregistered sales of XRP totaling approximately $600 million. The complaint alleges Larsen and Garlinghouse violated federal securities laws when they failed to register their offerings and sales of XRP or prove they were exempt from registration.

“Issuers seeking the benefits of a public offering, including access to retail investors, broad distribution, and a secondary trading market, must comply with the federal securities laws that require registration of offerings,” Stephanie Avakian, director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, said in a statement.



“Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse failed to register their ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP to retail investors, which deprived potential purchasers of adequate disclosures about XRP and Ripple’s business.”

According to the lawsuit, Ripple sold more than 14.6 billion units of XRP in return for cash or other consideration worth over $1.38 billion in order “to fund Ripple’s operations and enrich Larsen and Garlinghouse.” The SEC accuses Ripple of creating an “information vacuum” that allowed Larsen and Garlinghouse to sell XRP into a market “that possessed only the information defendants chose to share about Ripple and XRP.”

The SEC also said Ripple received legal advice as early as 2012 that XRP could be considered an “investment contract” under certain circumstances and therefore is a security under federal securities laws.

“Ripple and Larsen ignored this advice and instead elected to assume the risk of initiating a large-scale distribution of XRP without registration,” the complaint said.

The lawsuit could spook cryptocurrency exchanges selling XRP, as they risk being charged by the SEC for allowing unregistered securities to be traded. Bruce Fenton, CIO of Atlantic Financial Inc. and a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, warned cryptocurrency exchanges against continuing to sell the digital asset based on the SEC’s charges.

“I think any crypto exchange who doesn’t delist XRP this week is out of their mind,” Fenton said in a tweet. “If the SEC says it’s a security you’d be crazy to list it without a license.”

Ripple is already facing a class action lawsuit filed by a group of investors who claim the company never registered XRP as a security with the SEC, and have accused Ripple and Garlinghouse of making misleading statements. In October, Garlinghouse told CNBC in an interview that he was considering moving the firm to London because of the strict regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States.

The SEC’s complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse with violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

""It tells you about how powerful this bull market is,"" he said on ""Squawk Box."" ""They are throwing lots at the system, and it's not actually impacting it.""

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a Treasury Department division known as FinCEN, on Friday revealed new disclosure rules affecting private wallets and financial institutions intended to crack down on criminal activity involving cryptocurrency. Since then, the price of bitcoin has generally sustained its position above $23,000, according to data from Coin Metrics, despite potential risk.

Hoping to increase transparency, the guidelines require customers to be identified on transactions of more than $3,000 on self-hosted crypto wallets. Crypto platforms would be required to report transactions on unhosted wallets that top $10,000 within 15 days.

While bitcoin is not the direct target of and Galaxy does not expect to be affected by the changes, Novogratz said it reflects a common theme in the way the Trump administration governs. He also cautioned that it could cast a cloud over the crypto industry.

""I'm hoping, you know — we get a change of the guard in 20 days — I'm hoping we can get some more open-minded regulators,"" Novogratz said, referring to the incoming Biden administration.

Novogratz is a billionaire former hedge-fund manager and philanthropist. He is a frequent donor to Democratic politicians, including a $200,000 donation to the Biden Action Fund in June.

The proposal was brought by the Treasury Department about a month before the Trump administration will transition out of the White House. It provided a 15-day comment period on the potential changes, which has been criticized for being rushed, including by Novogratz, who advocates for a 60-day period.

""It's kind of endemic of the Trump administration trying to jam in legislation, and quite frankly there are a lot of unintended consequences,"" he said. ""This is anti-dollar ... and it's anti-innovation. It's going to push a lot of the cool stuff that's happening in crypto offshore.""

The continued rise in bitcoin is being powered by a wave of institutional investors, a market-moving force, who are betting on cryptocurrency. Novogratz said he's seeing ""no slow down"" in bitcoin adoption among Galaxy's clients. Since falling below $5,000 during the historic coronavirus-induced meltdown in assets, bitcoin broke above $20,000 for the first time last week.

Earlier this month, Novogratz said that there has been a shift in crypto ownership from individual investors to big funds. In 2017, he noted, nearly all transactions were by individual owners. He expects to see less volatility in digital coins as more institutional investors enter the market, helping to carry bitcoin to about $60,000 next year, more than double current levels.

Novogratz, however, hopes it doesn't come at the cost of innovation.

""Lots of these crypto companies both onshore and offshore are willing to push regulation and build great innovation,"" he said. ""I would love an administration, I would love a regulatory framework that embraces that, not fights that.""",2020-12-24 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/miami-mayor-crypto-governance,"Miami Mayor Francis Suarez may try to turn his city into a hotbed for cryptocurrency innovation.

Suarez tweeted Thursday that he is “absolutely exploring” making Miami, the seventh-largest city in the U.S., home to the country’s first crypto-centric municipal government, seemingly endorsing concepts from tokenization to on-chain voting. He tagged new city resident Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital and a crypto Twitter celebrity, for help.

London-based crypto-payments platform Wirex can now issue Visa accounts and process transactions autonomously, as the firm became a principal member of the payments giant.

Crypto Payments Platform Wirex Gets Principal Membership From Visa to Issue Cards Autonomously

According to the announcement, Wirex has been added to the European network of Visa as a member after long-lasting cooperation, whose customer base has over 3 million in the APAC and EEA countries. The company enables its users to transfer crypto and fiat currencies globally through the platform.

With the membership, Wirex becomes the second crypto company after Coinbase to get such kind of membership, although this is not the first payment giant the London-based firm partnered with.

On July 20, 2020, the company also teamed up with Mastercard to directly secure a principal membership to issue cards supporting both crypto and fiat currencies.

The latest figures revealed by Wirex show that the company had experienced a 271% increase in the number of crypto exchanges on their platform compared to December 2019. It also launched its first crypto-enabled debit card in 2014.

Cryptocurrencies and Payment Giants

Cuy Sheffield, senior director and head of cryptocurrency at Visa, commented on the announcement:

Digital currencies have the potential to extend the value of digital payments to a greater number of people and places. We’re excited to work with innovative Fintech’s like Wirex, and enable their customers to use digital currencies at more than 61 million merchants on the Visa network.

Moreover, Pavel Matveev, CEO and co-founder of Wirex, believes that achieving this principal membership from Visa paves the road to catch more opportunities to continue developing “a revolutionary product.”

Wirex is also preparing the ground to land in the US market, as they’re about to launch a single currency Visa card. However, Wirex is not the only one who offers bitcoin-based cards in the crypto sphere, as exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase offer such products.

YouTuber Crypto Daily commented on Bitcoin “rallying during an illiquid public holiday,” which is a testament to the digital currency’s bullish potential. “$100k is FUD now,” he said.

#Bitcoin rallying during an illiquid public holiday. $100k is FUD now. — Crypto Daily (@Crypto_Daily) December 25, 2020

2020 will go down as a landmark year for Bitcoin. While many institutions have been clamoring for years that the ‘institutions are coming,’ this year finally delivered on those revelations.",,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/indian-crypto-exchanges-in-wait-and-watch-mode-on-ripple-11608884225807.html,"A US lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc., the issuer of the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency , has sent the value of the XRP currency plunging but Indian exchanges have refrained from restricting its trading although they are closely monitoring the case.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case argues that XRP is a security rather than a currency and hence the issuer should have sought prior approval of the US securities regulator for launching it. It added that Ripple Labs and two of its executives raised over $1.3 billion through their unregistered digital asset securities offering.

Launched in 2013, XRP had a market cap of around $16 billion on 25 December, about two-thirds of the $24 billion it was worth on 21 December.

On 22 December, the SEC filed a complaint against Ripple for an “unregistered securities offering"", alleging that XRP was a security rather than a currency. An issue of securities in the US requires approval from the SEC. This caused the price of Ripple to drop from 0.56 US cents on 21 December to around 0.28 cents on 24 December, a 50% drop. On 25 December, the currency traded around 0.33 cents, a little above its recent lows.

Indian cryptocurrency exchanges expressed shock at the development.

“Ripple (XRP) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. It has also been among the top traded tokens on WazirX. SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple is shocking. Given the uncertainty of this situation, we will continue monitoring the lawsuit development and then take the necessary steps,"" said Siddharth Menon, co-founder and chief operating officer of WazirX, India’s largest crypto exchange by volumes.

Neeraj Khandelwal, the co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, said, “We are closely following the developments and waiting for more information on the matter before taking a decision.""

Cryptocurrency professionals also drew a distinction between XRP and other cryptocurrencies.

“Cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be mined by anyone. There is no issuer and owner. This was never the case with XRP. Ripple Labs owned 98% of it and issued a little bit every year. The company set the supply (100 billion tokens). This makes it more like a security than a cryptocurrency,"" said Gaurav Dahake, chief executive of Bitbns, a cryptocurrency exchange.

The lawsuit is also likely to influence regulators in other countries, including India.

Bitcoin saw a further 7.5% price surge over the past week, with today’s 5% price hike putting it at a new ATH of $24,660. The cryptocurrency had penetrated above $20,000 on December 16th, and it continued to rise last week until it met resistance at $23,853 (1.618 Fib Extension – purple).

The buyers struggled to break this resistance over the last few days as it went on to trade sideways between $23,853 and the support at $22,708 (.236 Fib Retracement).

Bitcoin rebounded from the lower boundary of this range yesterday, and it pushed higher above the $23,853 resistance today to reach the newly created ATH. It has since dropped slightly as it trades at $24,145.

Looking ahead, if the buyers continue to drive higher, the first level of resistance lies at $26,064. This if followed by $25,684 (1.272 Fib Extension), $26,000, $26,568 (1.414 Fib Extension), $27,163, and $27,880 (1.618 Fib Extension).

On the other side, the first level of support now lies at $23,853. This is followed by support at $23,000, $22,708 (.236 Fib), $21,721 (.382 Fib), and $21,000. Added support is found at $20,000, $19,893 (Previous ATH), and $19,173 (long term .382 Fib).

Ethereum

Ethereum is down by 42.5% over the past week but surged by 4% today, which allowed it to reach $615. Last Friday, the coin struggled to break beyond the $660 level, which caused the coin to roll over and head lower.

It continued to fall throughout the week and even spiked as low as $550 on Wednesday. Luckily, the buyers regrouped to allow Wednesday’s daily candle to close above $580, keeping it above a 2-month-old rising trend line.

From there, ETH continued to rebound as it broke back above $600 yesterday and continued to reach the current $626 level today, though it has decreased a bit after that.

Looking ahead, if the buyers continue to push higher, resistance lies at $650, $660, $675 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement), and $700. Beyond $700, resistance is found at $720, $733, and $751 (bearish .886 Fib).

On the other side, the first two support levels lie at $600 and the 2-month-old rising trend line. Beneath the trend line, support is found at $580 (.5 Fib), $556 (.618 Fib), and $530 (December lows).

Against Bitcoin, Ethereum saw a troublesome week after poking into a new 7-month low earlier this week. The coin was trading above 0.028 BTC at the start of the week as it started to slide lower. On Wednesday, Ethereum penetrated beneath the November low at 0.0262 BTC and continued as low as 0.024 BTC – setting the fresh 7-month low.

Luckily, the buyers managed to recover on Wednesday to close the daily candle above 0.025 BTC. It has since bounced slightly higher to trade at 0.0254 BTC today.

Looking ahead, the first level of resistance lies at 0.0258 BTC (bearish .236 Fib). This is followed by 0.0262 BTC (November lows), 0.027 BTC (bearish .382 Fib), 0.0279 BTC (Bearish .5 Fib), and 0.0284 (Feb 2020 Highs).

On the other side, the first level of support lies at 0.025 BTC. This is followed by 0.0245 BTC (July 2020 lows), 0.024 BTC, and 0.0237 BTC (downside 1.618 Fib Extension).

Ripple

Ripple saw a disastrous week after suffering a 50% price fall on Wednesday. It recovered by 16.2% today, putting the 7-day price fall to -35%. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.6 last Friday as it started to fall lower. On Tuesday, it sank beneath the $0.5 level and continued much lower on Wednesday when the news was announced that they would be sued by the SEC. This caused XRP to dip as low as $0.215.

It recovered from there slightly as the daily candle closed above $0.25. Over the past two days, XRP attempted to push higher but was unable to overcome the $0,386 resistance. It has since dropped back beneath $0.3 to trade at $0.282.

Moving forward, the first level of resistance lies at $0.386 (bearish .382 Fib). This is followed by $0.4 (100-days EMA), $0.44 (bearish .5 Fib), and $0.5.

On the other side, the first level of support lies at $0.254. This is followed by support at $0.25, $0.215, $0.2, and $0.171.

XRP also suffered majorly against Bitcoin as it dropped to 3-year lows this week. The cryptocurrency fell from above 1800 SAT on Wednesday to spike beneath the 1000 SAT level. It recovered slightly as the daily candle closed at 1100 SAT. Since then, XRP attempted to rebound but could not pass the 1550 SAT level (Nov 2020 low). It now trades at 1190 SAT.

Looking ahead, if the buyers push higher, the first level of resistance lies at 1550 SAT (November 2020 low). Above this, resistance lies at 1745 SAT (bearish .236 Fib), 1900 SAT (July 2020 lows), and 2000 SAT.

On the other side, the first level of support lies at 1190 SAT. This is followed by support at 1100 SAT, 10015 SAT, 1000 SAT, and 867 SAT.

Binance Coin

Binance Coin saw a strong 9.4% price hike this week, outperforming all the coins on this list. IT was trading at around $31 last Friday as it pushed higher over the weekend. Unfortunately, it was unable to overcome the resistance at $34.35 (July 2019 highs), which caused it to roll over and head lower during the week.

Luckily, BNB managed to fund strong support at $30.10 (.618 Fib) yesterday, which saw the coin rebounding to reach the current $32.15 level today.

Moving forward, if the buyers continue to drive higher, the first level of strong resistance is located at $34.35 (July 2019 Highs). Above this, resistance lies at $35.83 (bearish .886 Fib), $37, and $38.13. Added resistance is found at $39.61 (2019 Highs) and $40.

On the other side, support is found at $32, $31.17 (.5 Fib), $30.10 (.618 Fib), and $28.58 (.786 Fib).

Against Bitcoin, BNB actually returned to the 2-year low this week as it fell back into the low of 0.0013 BTC. It had attempted to push higher but was unable to break back above the November 2020 low at 0.00149 BTC. It is now trading at 0.00133 BTC.

Moving forward, the first level of support lies at 0.0013 BTC. This is followed by 0.00123 BTC (November 2018 low), 0.0012 BTC, and 0.00112 BTC.

On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at 0.0014 BTC. This is followed by 0.00149 BTC (Nov 20 lows), 0.0016 BTC, and 0.00166 BTC (May 2020 lows). Added resistance lies at 0.0018 BTC (100-days EMA).

Chainlink

Chainlink suffered an enormous 14% price fall over the past week as it currently trades at $11.56. It was trading around $14 last Friday as it started to fall. Like most coins, it saw a disastrous spike lower on Wednesday as the sellers pushed the coin as low as $8.00. The bulls quickly responded to allow LINK to close the daily candle at $11.

From there, LINK has pushed slightly higher to trade at $11.45.

Moving forward, if the buyers continue upward, the first level of resistance lies at $12. This is followed by $12.81, $13, $13.80, and $14. Added resistance is found at $14.30 and $15.

Alternatively, the first level of support lies at $11.40. This is followed by $11, $10.50, $10, and $9.80.

Against Bitcoin, LINK spiked into a fresh 9-month low this week as it dropped as low as 35,800 SAT on Wednesday. By the end of the day, the buyers managed to push LINK higher to close the candle at 47,300 SAT (.886 Fib Retracement). LINK since moved sideways from here.

Looking ahead, if the sellers break beneath 47,300 SAT, the first level of support lies at 46,000 SAT. This is followed by 42,680 SAT, 40,000 SAT, and 37,683 SAT. Added support lies at 35,000 SAT and 33,285 SAT (August 2020 lows).

On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at 50,000 SAT. This is followed by 52,600 SAT, 55,000 SAT, and 60,000 SAT.",2020-12-25 18:00:18+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/uk-crypto-exchange-exmo-says-4m-of-hacked-funds-was-through-poloniex,"Disclosure

Two million? Five million?

Try 924,000. That’s right: The U.S. currently has under 1 million hospital beds for a population of approximately 330 million, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA). By my calculation, that comes out to 28 beds per 10,000 people.

This is the real threat posed by the pandemic, as I see it. Supply-demand imbalances can often be favorable when we’re talking about asset prices, but they’re not ideal during a global health crisis.

As of today, more than a third of Americans live in areas that are critically short on intensive care unit (ICU) beds. All of Southern California—a region that’s home to around 25 million people—is now at 0% availability.

And it’s not just beds. Hospitals in half of the states are reporting severe shortages in nurses, doctors and other staff.

I have only admiration for our nation’s frontline medical workers, many of whom have not seen any respite this holiday season. On behalf of everyone at U.S. Global Investors, I extend my sincerest gratitude. The greatest gift we can give them is for us to remain safe and follow precautionary recommendations.

Fed Commits to Keep Buying at Least $120 Billion of Bonds Each Month

Last week the Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and committed to continue its bond-buying program until “substantial progress” has been made regarding employment and inflation. Initial jobless claims increased for the second straight week, hitting 885,000 in the week ended December 12—the most since early September.

I was floored to see just how much the Fed is buying—and will continue to buy—each month. The central bank is gobbling up as much $120 billion of debt, split between $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

The size of the Fed’s balance sheet now stands at a staggering $7.36 trillion, or 34% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Fed policy has crushed the U.S. dollar, now on track to record its worst year since 2017. Last Thursday, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the currency against those of other major economies, traded below 90 for the first time in more than two years.

This has all been very supportive of hard asset prices and haven demand. Gold notched its third straight week of gains and is currently poised to have its best year since 2010, when the yellow metal advanced nearly 30%. Copper, meanwhile, has now advanced for seven straight weeks and is trading at its highest price in close to eight years.

This Time It’s Different: 2020 Crypto Rally Driven by Institutional Investors

And then there’s Bitcoin. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has surged nearly 220% this year, touching an all-time high of $23,717 in intraday trading last Thursday.

Ethereum, meanwhile, has shot up almost 400% this year to around $640, which is still down 31% from its record high.

I’ve seen numerous market “experts” declare this another crypto bubble similar to 2017. But unlike then, the current run-up is driven not just by retail investors but also big-name investors, institutions, hedge funds and more.

Those include people like billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who’s buying Bitcoin in response to unprecedented money-printing, as well as firms like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance (MassMutual), which purchased $100 million of the digital currency earlier this month.

Although $100 million is a relatively small position for the insurance company, it was enough to turn some heads.

“MassMutual’s Bitcoin purchases represent another milestone in the Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors,” JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note to clients. “One can see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as other insurance companies and pension funds follow MassMutual’s example.”

Another Bitcoin bull is Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, which has $233 billion in total assets under management (AUM).

Speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Minerd said he believes Bitcoin should be worth—are you sitting down?—$400,000. HIs outlook is based on Bitcoin’s scarcity and relative valuation to gold as a percent of GDP.

“Bitcoin actually has a lot of the attributes of gold and at the same time has an unusual value in terms of transactions,” he said.

Crypto miners and blockchain firms have likewise done well this year. I’m pleased to tell you that HIVE Blockchain Technologies was up nearly 2,800% on Friday, which has pushed its market cap above C$950 million. This puts it on a trajectory to hit a C$1 billion valuation before the end of 2020.

Keep in mind that cryptos is still extremely volatile. Bitcoin, for instance, has a daily standard deviation of plus or minus 5%. They may not sound like a whole lot until you compare it to gold, which has a daily standard deviation of only 1%.

Coinbase Files for IPO; Robinhood IPO Could Come as Early as Q1 of 2021

Soon there may be another way for investors to participate in cryptocurrencies besides buying them outright or investing in miners like HIVE. In a press release last week, the North American crypto trading platform Coinbase said it submitted paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Silicon Valley unicorn is valued at an estimated $28 billion, according to data firm Messari, and sees around $1 billion in trading volume every day.

Coinbase isn’t the only online exchange that’s weighing a public offering. Robinhood, the six-year-old trading app favored by younger, less experienced investors, is eyeing the first quarter of 2021 as a potential IPO target. After stocks collapsed in March and April of this year, the number of people who downloaded and started using Robinhood surged to 13 million, up from 2 million three years earlier. These millennial investors beat Warren Buffett at his own game, buying up distressed airline stocks at a time when the Berkshire Hathaway chief was selling.

Before listing, Robinhood will need to deal with recent complaints brought against it by regulators in Massachusetts, which allege the brokage firm “lured” inexperienced investors by turning investing into a game. Last week, Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle SEC investigations into how it generates revenue from business deals with high-speed trading firms.

A Banner Year for IPOs

Robinhood’s potential listing in Q1 of 2021 would follow a banner year for companies going public, particularly tech companies. As of December 18, there have been 470 IPOs on the U.S. stock market, a little more than double the amount last year. Three of the 10 biggest U.S. tech IPOs of all time, in terms of capital raised, occurred in 2020. In September, data management firm Snowflake raised $3.36 billion on its opening day, a sum beaten slightly by DoorDash ($3.37 billion) and Airbnb ($3.50) in December.

These have been monster deals that demonstrate just how valuable intangibles really are. Take a look at Airbnb. The company, which does not own any hotels or properties of its own, now has a higher valuation than the combined market caps of Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined.

As others have pointed out, this trend of valuing intangibles ahead of tangibles is only accelerating. Facebook, the world’s biggest content purveyor, produces little to no content of its own. Alibaba, the world’s biggest retailer, has no inventory. Uber, the world’s biggest taxi service, owns no taxis.

Power firm Chernomorenergo’s general director Mikhail Valerievich Logua, an Abkhaz politician, has signed an order imposing “the immediate shutdown of all operating farms for the extraction of cryptocurrencies” in Abkhazia, according to a Dec. 25 report by Russian industry news outlet Forklog.

Recognized only by Russia, Abkhazia fought a war of secession with Georgia in the ‘90s, declaring independence in 1999, according to the CIA World Factbook.

The Chernomorenergo action follows a recent announcement by Russian power firm Rosseti that the firm fears that record high Bitcoin (BTC) prices may spur a new wave of illegal cryptocurrency mining operations threatening Abkhazia’s energy grid.

The document signed by Logua imposes a stop of all cryptocurrency mining activity by Dec. 29. The order also gives the heads of Chernomorenergo and electricity distributor Energosbyt personal responsibility for “unauthorized technological connection to the power grid of all subscribers for the purpose of mining cryptocurrencies.”

Earlier this month, Forklog also reported that Deputy Prime Minister of Abkhazia Christina Ozgan announced an order for the shutdown of all mining farms in the republic until June 1, 2021.

The reason for the shutdown is that in mid-September, a boom of crypto mining activity in the region caused an energy crisis, according to local news outlet Jam reported.

At the time, a Chernomorenergo representative explained that the total capacity of the mining equipment operating in the republic is at least 40-45 megawatts, which constitutes a very high portion of the region’s total available power production:

“With round-the-clock operation, equipment of such capacity can consume about 400 million kWh during a year, which is the majority of the projected shortage of electricity in Abkhazia. The projected deficit for the remaining months of 2020 may amount to 704 million kWh.”

Raids conducted by local authorities because of all those measures resulted in nearly 7,000 crypto mining hardware units being disconnected from the grid.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Abkhazia reported the identification of 19 mining farms in a week and explained that most of the activity was conducted from abandoned houses, uninhabitable premises that have been converted into protected areas, as well as simply in transportable trailers.",2020-12-26 03:29:08+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/portnoy-s-small-business-relief-fund-now-accepting-bitcoin-crypto-donations,"Barstool Media’s Dave Portnoy is accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency donations for his small-business relief fund. Less than 24 hours after integration, the crypto community has responded with incredible generosity.

The Barstool Fund launched last week to raise money for small businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time of writing, the Fund had raised nearly $5.3 million to help 14 businesses. More than 53,000 donors have contributed. For tax reasons, the campaign is scheduled to run until the end of the year.

A huge chunk of those donations came from the cryptocurrency community after Morgan Creek Digital set up a Bitcoin address through The Giving Block, a crypto donations company. In addition to Bitcoin, the Barstool Fund also accepts donations in Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Basic Attention Token, Chainlink, Gemini Dollar, DAI, Storj, Amp and 0x.

Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital, tells Cointelegraph that “at least $750,000” worth of crypto donations were made as of Friday morning:

“It is hard to track every donation coming out of the crypto community, but we know of at least $750,000 that has been donated in US dollars or crypto. The actual number is likely higher.”

“2020 has been a tough year,” Pompliano said, adding that “Bitcoin has been great to all of us though.”

He continues:

“There is no better way to end the year then with a new Bitcoin all-time high and a few donations to share the love.""

Cointelegraph reporter Helen Partz reached out to Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, who explained how crypto donations have been incorporated into the Barstool Fund.

Users can donate crypto to the charity by visiting the Barstool Fund, clicking “contribute to the fund” and choosing the cryptocurrency option. There, they’ll have the ability to generate a wallet address and send the donation from their own wallet address. Donors will receive a tax receipt delivered to their email once the payment clears.

The Covid-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented response from federal, state and local governments as health authorities struggled to contain the spread of the disease. Shelter-in-place orders, while intended to be temporary, have resulted in the permanent closure of hundreds of thousands of businesses.

As Pompliano noted, small businesses are responsible for roughly 50% of U.S. jobs and they “keep the American dream alive for billions of people around the world.” The economic consequences of the pandemic, insofar as it impacts small businesses, will reverberate around the world.

Congress has finally agreed on a new Covid relief package that earmarks an additional $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. However, with additional lockdowns looming, many fear that the relief measures are too little, too late, especially for hospitality businesses that have been impacted the most by strict shelter-in-place orders.",,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-era-review-does-works-184000081.html,"Bitcoin Era is an online app for trading.

",,https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tron-trx-makes-an-entry-into-nfts-with-the-trc-721-standard/,"Summary:

Tron (TRX) has launched its first NFT standard dubbed TRC-721

The NFT standard was launched to allow each token to have its own unique value

The NFT market on the Ethereum blockchain has been thriving with some tokens fetching 6 figures

The Tron (TRX) network now has its own NFT standard protocol. Yesterday, the team at the Tron Foundation announced the launch of the TRC-721 standard that is specific for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) on the network.

According to the official announcement, this new token standard will open ‘huge possibilities for blockchain applications’ as explained below.

Each NFT contains owner ID, rich metadata, safe file links and other identifying information that is recorded in its smart contract. It is this information that makes each NFT unique and unexchangeable. NFT standards are widely used in different fields of blockchain. It plays a key role in some Layer2 solutions, DApps and projects like tBTC with huge economic value. More and more DeFi projects try to integrate with NFTs to enhance their ecosystems. We believe that standardized NFTs will open up infinite opportunities on TRON as well. That is why we introduced TRC-721.

NFTs on Ethereum Are Thriving

The Tron foundation launching a unique NFT standard comes as no surprise as the Non-Fungible Token marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain has been thriving in a big way. NFT investors have been bidding up to six figures for digital art pieces on the Ethereum blockchain.

Back in mid-November, an Ethereum investor wowed the NFT community by bidding $777,777 for an art collection on the Nifty Gateway marketplace owned by the Gemini exchange. The event was highlighted by the following tweet by the team at Nifty Gateway demonstrating the exciting potential of the NFT marketplace.

THIS SAVAGE JUST BID $777,777 WITH LITERALLY 1 SECOND LEFT — Nifty Gateway (@niftygateway) December 13, 2020

With the new NFT standard, the Tron (TRX) ecosystem is bound to develop in a similar manner. Investors, developers, collectors and artists will have a chance at utilizing the Tron Network’s efficient speed and lower transaction cost to grow the NFT industry.",

New Delhi: Bitcoin, by far the best-known cryptocurrency, has in recent weeks been making headlines with the unreal upwards movement it recorded on the price charts recently, setting fresh all-time highs.

With prices of Bitcoin soaring to a record high of $23,000 and bringing its returns so far in 2020 to over 200%. Many investors are flocking to this unregulated new-age asset. The price of Bitcoin towards the end of this COVID-hit year reminds of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. At least in the last few weeks, the Bitcoin rally has been exponential so much so that new milestones have become the norm. This has led to uncertainty in predicting the possible extent of the bitcoin rally. The value of Bitcoin has crossed $23,000 as of December 17. Just 24 hours earlier, the bitcoin breached the $20,000 mark for the first time in its short history. But beyond the rally and the milestones, the year 2020 has been a transformative one for the cryptocurrency and the ecosystem.

We spoke to industry experts to find answers to the most frequently asked questions that pop-up in one's mind when they think of investing in this new age asset class.

Is it a good time to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

Monark Modi, Founder, and CEO of Bitex, said: ""Unlike 2017, where investment in cryptocurrency was more driven by popular sentiment, in 2020 there is a lot more seriousness towards this alternative investment class. This is definitely the time for Indian investors and traders to invest in cryptocurrencies as they have better knowledge. We are seeing investment banks embracing the ecosystem, payment service providers putting their trust and even large-scale investors are investing in cryptocurrency.

Speaking about whether one should invest in Bitcoin as a short-term investment or otherwise, Vikram Rangala, CMO, ZebPay said: ""The simplest way for anyone to get into bitcoin is rupee cost averaging so that the average price that you invest is the best possible price you can get overtime. At ZebPay, we always recommend users to invest for the long term and think of Bitcoin as a store of value, rather than go for short-term trading and speculation. If you held bitcoin longer than 3 and a half years during any period up to now, you had a 99.9% chance of making a profit. That’s almost never seen in any other asset class.""

Decoding SC cryptocurrency judgment: What does it mean for investors

The Supreme Court’s ruling was seminal in setting the road ahead for cryptocurrencies in India. While a lot of us are still waiting for more clarity to emerge but the lifting of the ban essentially means there is a need to explore the opportunity around this digital asset and learn how to regulate it.

Explaining the SC ruling, Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, CoinDCX said: ""In April 2018, the central bank Reserve Bank of India (RBI) passed a de facto banking ban which prevented banks from working with cryptocurrency exchanges in India. This banking ban was specifically put towards financial institutions, banks to prevent them from offering banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges/firms, etc.""

""But the banking ban was misunderstood by a large number of Indians who thought that crypto was banned and it was illegal. That was not the case. Buying crypto, trading and holding were not banned. There were no laws and regulations passed for buying, trading, or holding crypto,"" Gupta added.

In March 2020, two years after the banking ban, the Supreme court lifted the banking ban, and then many banks have directly started providing banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges, banks.

Rangala said that ""Cryptocurrency has never been illegal in India, and the RBI itself restated that crypto is legal. We look forward to getting regulatory clarity, but in the meantime, many of the existing laws in India do apply to crypto even if they don’t say the word crypto. Our legal team works to make sure that we are following the letter and the spirit of the law in all areas.""

""We believe that until we get government regulation, crypto firms should set the highest possible standards in their self-regulation to protect our customers and public, and if possible to serve as a model for how future policy should look. Indian investors should know that crypto is legal in India, but they should invest through a trusted exchange that follows proper KYC and anti-money laundering policies,"" Rangala added.

For most Indians cryptocurrency means Bitcoin. Which are the other major cryptocurrencies?

For most Indian investors the focus is currently on Bitcoin and the recent rally that has taken the price of Bitcoin to its all-time high is reflective of this mood. Modi states that "" It is true that Bitcoin is the most popular. However, another cryptocurrency to watch out for is Ethereum, which itself has seen a rally reaching $677 in the past week. It is already the second-largest cryptocurrency and traders remain very bullish on it hitting the $800 mark soon.""

""Ethereum’s blockchain allows for the development of a huge range of software applications. It is sometimes called a “world computer” because it functions like a giant, decentralised operating system. Ethereum is like the bitcoin software, but it does things differently. Bitcoin can move value from one place to another. Ethereum can move value from one place to another based on conditions, in the form of “if-then"" contracts. The contracts execute automatically once the “if"" part has been completed. This allows the creation of smart contracts and complex applications. For example, IF my taxi has brought me to my destination, THEN credit the driver’s account. Ethereum supports a whole host of decentralized applications, and many see it as the starting point for completely decentralised finance in the future,"" Rangala further explained.

A beginners guide: Know this before you invest

First, for any trader or investor, especially those who are beginners, Bitex would advise that is important to understand the basic concepts of Blockchain that are the underlying framework of cryptocurrency. This helps clear many doubts and misconceptions and gives a fair understanding of the alternate investment class.

Modi said: ""It is also important that people start building upon the asset in a systematic manner and for a longer duration so that any volatility in price averaged out in the long run. Indian investors and traders can also leverage platforms like Bitex, which is a digital asset exchange and professional trading platform to buy and trade in cryptocurrencies. It is also important to observe the price trends, understanding technical indicators for any investor investing in cryptocurrency.

Further, experts recommend getting started with a small amount—as little as 100 rupees—that you commit to investing every day, week, or month.

Getting started

Rangala explains: ""You can get started with your cryptocurrency investment by registering yourself as a ZebPay member, or with any of the other crypto exchanges in India. It takes about 5 minutes to download our app and complete your KYC and bank verification, and then you’re ready to deposit money and start investing.""

If a person is new to crypto, they can firstly start learning about Bitcoin and gradually take steps towards investing. Gupta said: ""One can start investing as low as Rs 10 on CoinDCX, or any small amount they are comfortable with. The best part when new users buy from CoinDCX’s Insta, there are zero fees for buying /selling crypto from INR and they can purchase any crypto for as low as Rs 10.""",,https://www.coindesk.com/b2c2-becomes-latest-crypto-market-maker-to-stop-xrp-trading-report,"Disclosure

Cryptocurrency trading platform Livecoin claims that it has been hacked after the crypto community noticed the price of bitcoin shoot up to half a million dollars. Meanwhile, users are complaining that they cannot withdraw their funds, suspecting the exchange of pulling an exit scam.

$500K per Bitcoin on Livecoin Exchange

Russian cryptocurrency exchange Livecoin claims that it suffered a security breach over Christmas after the crypto community observed the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soar exponentially on the exchange above their market prices.

Bitcoin was reportedly trading at about $500,000, while ETH surpassed $15,000, and XRP rose above $17. At other exchanges, BTC is currently trading at around $24,813, ETH at $630, and XRP at $0.31.

Meanwhile, a number of users are complaining on social media that their deposits were not credited to their accounts and they could not withdraw their funds from the exchange. This has caused many to suspect an exit scam.

Livecoin subsequently posted a message on its website on Christmas Eve asking customers to stop using its services. “Don’t deposit funds, don’t trade, don’t use API,” the notice reads, adding:

We are under a carefully planned attack, which has been prepared, as we assume, over the last few months. We lost control of all our servers, backend and nodes.

The notice continues, “we were not able to stop our service in time … We are working in contact with local police authorities. We really do our best to overcome this issue.”

However, there have still been quite a few and most of them have originated from the nascent decentralized finance sector.

DeFi has been one of the main drivers of crypto market momentum in 2020 and it stands to reason that the emerging financial landscape has been a magnet for scammers and hackers. Largely unaudited smart contracts coupled with cloned code have been a recipe for vulnerabilities and exploits, often resulting in millions of dollars in digital assets being pilfered.

A CipherTrace report from November 2020 stated that during the first half of the year, DeFi took up 45% of all thefts and hacks resulting in over $50 million lost. That figure rose to 50% of all thefts and hacks in the second half, according to the report. Speaking to Cointelegraph, CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans warned of a potential regulatory crackdown: “DeFi hacks now make up more than half of all cryptocurrency hacks in 2020, a trend that is attracting attention from regulators.”

He added that of greater concern to regulators is the lack of Anti-Money Laundering compliance: “Funds stolen in the largest hack of 2020 - the $280 million KuCoin hack - were laundered using DeFi protocols.” Jevans also believes that 2021 is likely to bring clarity from regulators in terms of what actions DeFi protocols are expected to take to avoid the consequences of a failure to comply with AML, Capture the Flag, and possible sanctions.

Exchange hacks in 2020

The KuCoin hack occurred in late September when exchange CEO, Johnny Lyu, confirmed that the incursion affected the firm’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 hot wallets, after private keys were leaked.

By early October KuCoin said it had identified suspects and had officially involved law enforcement in the investigation. By mid-November the Singapore based exchange declared that it had recovered 84% of the stolen crypto and resumed full services for the majority of its tradable assets.

There were other exchange hacks this year, but KuCoin was the largest. In February Italian exchange Altsbit lost almost all of its funds in a $70,000 hack, and there have been a couple of other minor crypto exchange breaches. In October 2020, as many as 75 centralized crypto exchanges had closed due to various reasons, hacking being onem.

DeFi’s 2020 hacks and exploits

With billions of dollars pouring into DeFi protocols and yield farms, the emerging landscape became a hotbed for hackers. The first major incursion of 2020 happened on DeFi lending platform bZx in February when two flash loan exploits resulted in the loss of nearly $1 million in user funds. A flash loan is when crypto collateral is borrowed and repaid within the same transaction.

bZx froze operations to prevent further loss, but this generated a wave of criticism from industry observers claiming that it was ultimately a centralized platform after all and could be the “death of DeFi.”

Markets crashed in March resulting in a lot of collateral liquidations, especially for Maker’s MKR token, but these were not hacks. The next one of those came the following month when a wrapped version of Bitcoin called imBTC was attacked using something called an ERC-777 token standard reentrancy method. The attacker was able to siphon a Uniswap liquidity pool for all of its value, estimated to be $300,000 at the time.

April also saw Chinese lending platform dForce drained of all its liquidity using the same exploit. The hacker repeatedly increased their ability to borrow other assets and made off with around $25 million in funds.

In June, an exploit was discovered in Bancor’s smart contracts that resulted in the draining of as much as $460,000 in tokens. The DeFi automated market maker stated that they had deployed a new version of the smart contract that had fixed the vulnerability.

Balancer was the next DeFi protocol to get exploited to the tune of $500,000 in wrapped Ether pilfered from its liquidity pools using a well-planned arbitrage attack. A series of flash loans and arbitraged token swaps were carried out in an attack on a vulnerability that the Balancer team apparently already knew about.

Not so much a hack as another exploit, but bZx was in the news again in July with a dubious token sale that was manipulated by bots placing buy orders in the same block that marked the start of the token generation event. Almost half a million dollars in price pump profits was captured by the attackers.

DeFi options protocol Opyn was the next victim in August when hackers exploited its ETH Put contracts making off with more than $370,000. The exploit allowed attackers to “double exercise” Ethereum Put oTokens and steal the collateral. Opyn recovered around 440,000 in USDC from outstanding vaults using a white hat hack, effectively returning them to Put sellers.

Again, not a direct hack but a code flaw in an unaudited Yam Finance smart contract affected the rebasing of the governance token resulting in a price collapse in mid-August. The protocol was forced to appeal to DeFi whales to save it by voting for a restart as version 2.

When the Sushi unrolls

The SushiSwap saga began at the end of August and the terms “vampire mining”’ and “rug pull” were coined. The anonymous protocol cloner and administrator known as “Chef Nomi” sold $8 million worth of SUSHI tokens causing the token price to collapse. A few days later, the protocol was rescued by FTX exchange CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was handed control by a consortium of DeFi whales through a multi-signature smart contract. Eventually all the funds were returned to the developer fund.

The rug pulls, or “pump and dumps” as they were termed during the previous altcoin boom in 2017, continued with a number of DeFi clones such as Pizza and Hotdog. Token prices for these food farms surged and collapsed within hours and sometimes even minutes.

In mid-October, hordes of “degenerate farmers,” or degens as they were termed, piled money into an unaudited and unreleased smart contract from DeFi protocol Yearn Finance founder Andre Cronje. The Eminence Finance contract lost $15 million when it was hacked within hours of Cronje posting teasers about the new “gaming multiverse” on twitter. The hacker returned around $8 million but kept the rest, which prompted the disgruntled traders to initiate legal action against the Yearn team over lost funds.

In late October, a sophisticated flash loan arbitrage attack on the Harvest Finance protocol resulted in the loss of $24 million in stablecoins in around seven minutes. The attack sparked debate as to whether these exploitations of the design of the system can be considered as hacks.

November was a particularly painful month for Akropolis which had to “pause the protocol” as hackers made off with $2 million in DAI stablecoin. The Value DeFi protocol lost $6 million in an all too common flash loan exploit, yield generating stablecoin project Origin Dollar was exploited for $7 million, and Pickle Finance suffered a $20 million collateral loss in a sophisticated “‘evil jar"" exploit.

One that broke the mold of exploiting the system was a personal attack on an individual in mid-December. Nexus Mutual DeFi protocol founder Hugh Karp lost $8 million from his MetaMask wallet when a hacker managed to infiltrate his computer, spoofing a transaction. These types of attacks are generally less common as they involve some degree of social engineering.

The last reported flash loan attack of the year, so far, was an $8 million incursion on Warp Finance on December 18.

Many retail traders and investors have also fallen foul to phishing attempts and Ledger hardware wallet owners have also been targeted in 2020 after the personal information of some 272,000 Ledger buyers was hacked.

Battle hardening DeFi

The majority of smart contract and flash loan exploits in 2020 will serve to battle-harden the emerging financial ecosystem as it develops. New and smarter DeFi protocols are likely to emerge next year, but, as always, scammers, hackers and cybercriminals will also up their game in an attempt to stay ahead.

A huge dose of vigilance and attention is needed to delve into the current world of DeFi, but it has come a very long way in such a short period of time, and the decentralized financial landscape of the future is constantly evolving.",,https://dailyhodl.com/2020/12/26/mike-novogratz-says-regulators-targeting-crypto-industry-not-bitcoin-or-ethereum/,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says that while regulators don’t have Bitcoin and Ethereum in their sights, they are targeting multiple areas of the crypto industry.

In a CNBC interview, Novogratz highlights the sectors that are likely to be impacted by the efforts of outgoing US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to regulate the space.

“These regulations really are hitting the stablecoin market and they are not actually designed to go after Bitcoin and Ethereum per se; they are designed for the companies that traffic in them. And those are mostly companies in retail.”

Last week, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a US Treasury Department agency, proposed rules that would mandate financial service providers in crypto to store, and in some cases, pass on information regarding funds sent to cryptocurrency wallets.

The crypto bull first emphasizes that the proposed rules should not have been put out just weeks before the current US Treasury Secretary paves the way for a new appointee.

“This stuff should have a proper 60-day comment period.”

On the impact of the proposed regulations, Novogratz says they will disadvantage the US if implemented.

“Quite frankly there are a lot of unintended consequences. This is anti-dollar. It boosts China in lots of ways. And it is anti-innovation. It is going to push a lot of the cool stuff that’s happening in crypto offshore.”

Novogratz reveals that he hopes the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden will be more friendly to the crypto industry.

“I’m hoping that with the change of guard in 20 days, I’m hoping we get some more open-minded regulators.”

The Galaxy Digital CEO adds that the continuing Bitcoin bull run in the face of regulatory fears is a sign of BTC’s strength.

“It tells you about how powerful this bull market is. They are throwing lots at the system and it’s not actually impacting it.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against a cryptocurrency hedge fund founder for fraud. The regulator is seeking an emergency order freezing $25 million in digital assets held by a crypto hedge fund he controls.

Crypto Hedge Fund Founder Sued in the US

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued a crypto hedge fund founder in Manhattan federal court. The regulator alleges that Stefan Qin, a 23-year-old Australian, defrauded investors in his $92.4 million cryptocurrency arbitrage fund, according to Tuesday’s court filing.

Qin founded New York-based Virgil Capital and four other entities. He allegedly fabricated records, failed to redeem $3.5 million for investors, and tried to withdraw $1.7 million of investor funds to pay off Chinese loan sharks, the SEC said. According to Reuters:

The SEC has asked U.S. Judge Lorna Schofield for an emergency order freezing $25 million in digital assets held by another Qin-controlled fund.

The SEC explained that Qin controls two cryptocurrency funds: the Virgil Sigma Fund and the VQR Multistrategy Fund.

He “claims to trade for the Sigma Fund by taking a market-neutral ‘arbitrage approach to the cryptocurrency market,’ utilizing ‘a proprietary algorithmic trading system that continually scans for price differences between cryptocurrency markets,'” the SEC noted. Qin further claimed that his trading algorithm can “generate better returns than an investment in bitcoin.”

The Sigma Fund documentation provided to investors claimed that the fund “held millions of dollars worth of digital assets at 39 trading platforms, including three of the largest U.S.-based platforms,” the SEC wrote, emphasizing:

In reality, the Sigma Fund held no assets at any of those U.S.-based platforms, and the purported platform account balances were fabricated.

Moreover, the SEC explained that the crypto hedge fund founder told investors wanting to redeem investments totaling $3.5 million in the middle of this year that their funds would be moved to the VQR Multistrategy Fund. However, in reality, the funds were not transferred.

In December, Qin asked VQR head trader Antonio Hallak to help him withdraw $1.7 million from that hedge fund, according to a declaration by Hallak filed in the case. Qin claimed he had a “liquidity issue” and needed to repay a loan that he had taken out “from lenders he feared in China,” the SEC detailed. After Hallak informed him that he could not use the investors’ capital in the VQR Fund, Qin threatened to “fire everyone if necessary” to make the full withdrawal.

“Bank records show that several large wire transfers totaling approximately $2.5 million have been received by the Sigma Fund since June 2020,” the SEC continued. “Approximately $1.3 million of the $2.5 million was transferred by Qin first to a foreign bank account in the Sigma Fund’s name and then transferred immediately to a U.S. bank account in Qin’s name.”

The SEC has asked the court to permanently restrain Qin and his companies from participating in “the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security,” as well as order them to “disgorge their ill-gotten gains according to proof, plus prejudgment interest” and pay civil penalties.

What do you think about Qin’s case? Let us know in the comments section below.

The top U.S. banking regulator is concerned that the Biden administration may roll back some cryptocurrency regulations aimed at protecting consumers. This includes allowing national banks to custody crypto assets put in place during the Trump administration.

Biden Administration Could Change US Crypto Regulations

Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, shared several concerns regarding cryptocurrency regulations in an interview with CNBC last week.

Brooks is the administrator of the federal banking system and chief officer of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC supervises almost 1,200 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banks.

He was asked to comment about the recent bitcoin bull run from the regulatory viewpoint. Brooks replied:

I will tell you what I am worried about is all of this is happening in the environment where we are about to have a change of presidential administration, and there are calls on Capitol Hill to dismantle some of the regulatory protections we put in place for this stuff.

The OCC green-lighted banks under its supervision to provide cryptocurrency custody services in July. Brooks explained that his agency “is trying to make it safer for people to custody in national banks.” He added: “We’ve talked about banks supporting some of these stablecoin projects. If those protections aren’t in place, I really worry about the environments for these kinds of things. That’s what I’m most focused on. How do we preserve the safety for the people who participate in that market.”

He noted that “We are at a really critical inflection point right now is what I’d tell you. It’s kind of a fork in the road.” He proceeded to outline two paths for crypto regulation. “One path forward is that we find ways of addressing money laundering risks and we find ways of addressing terrorism financing which I think can be done. But we make this safe for the consumers and investors who participate, that’s why the banking system has such an important role to play,” he asserted, adding:

The other path which is a very real potential here is that we politicize some of these tech issues, whether it’s crypto or fintech more broadly. We politicize it by undoing all of the good work this administration has done to make it safer, to make it more real.

Brooks then referenced the letter by Congresswoman Maxine Waters urging the Biden administration to roll back some of the regulations the OCC put in place. Among the recommendations was rescinding allowing national banks and federal savings associations to provide crypto custody services. Regarding the suggestions Waters put forth in her letter, Brooks said, “If we do those things, then I’m not sure we have enough of a foundation to move forward. It’s all about consolidating regulatory gains and consumer protection that we are trying to put in place. That’s got to stick around.”

He further detailed that “The role of the government is to make sure that markets are well-regulated and well-organized so that people who are transacting know that they are transacting with good people and not bad people.” He emphasized, “Part of that means that, as in any financial markets, there has to be tracing and no anonymity.”

The acting comptroller of the currency clarified that people who hold cryptocurrencies need to know that they are not going to lose them. “That’s why it’s important to people that they be able to custody their assets in a bank, for example, the same way you might custody your stock certificates or any other assets that you own,” Brooks opined.

“This is a real political debate right now,” Brooks noted, emphasizing:

People may not realize this but there’s leadership in Congress who’s urging the incoming Biden administration to roll back some of those protections. I think, in the name of politics, not in the name of protecting investors.

Recently, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new regulation for cryptocurrency wallets. Public comments can be submitted before Jan. 4. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking action against a number of crypto firms for selling unregistered securities, including Ripple Labs.

Do you think the Biden administration will roll back some crypto regulations? Let us know in the comments section below.

It just passed $28,000 and shows no signs of stopping.

Visa V Mastercard MA Walmart WMT The digital currency has a market value north of $500 billion. Think Bitcoin is just a fad? It's worth more thanor. Or

Bitcoin passed $20,000 for the first time just 11 days ago. Now it's knocking at $30,000's door.

Its rapid rise has been remarkable -- or insane, depending on your appetite for risk. But there's some logic to the run-up: Investors are pouring money into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the Covid-19 pandemic as the Federal Reserve sent interest rates near zero (and expects to keep them there for several more years), severely weakening the US dollar.

That makes bitcoin, comparatively, an attractive currency. There's a set limit to the number of bitcoins on the planet, and investors believe that once the supply runs out, the digital coin's value can only increase.

The cryptocurrency almost quadrupled, surpassing $20,000 for the first time as it notched record after record. The diehards cheered it as an inflation hedge in an era of unprecedented central bank largesse. Wall Street veterans from Paul Tudor Jones to Stanley Druckenmiller blessed it as an alternative asset, adding to the rally. And companies like MicroStrategy Inc. and Square Inc. moved cash reserves into crypto in search of better returns than near-zero interest rates deliver.

While none of those reasons for buying Bitcoin comport with its origins as an alternative to fiat currencies, they do point to a growing acceptance of crypto as an asset class of its own. And that has the zealot-like community taking yet another victory lap in their quest for legitimacy.

“What’s happening now -- and it’s happening faster than anyone could ever imagine -- is that Bitcoin is moving from a fringe esoteric asset to the mainstream,"" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. “If it’s going mainstream, there is just so much money on the sidelines that is going to have to come in and establish a position that it leaves me very bullish for 2021.""

But with Bitcoin capturing greater attention, it could also garner further scrutiny from regulators, says Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at online-trading platform eToro. “Despite this meteoric rise, there are some storm clouds on the horizon,"" he said, including the fallout from several last-minute actions by the outgoing Trump administration, among others.

Devotees say that in some ways, the pandemic-ravaged year proved the perfect environment for the digital coin. Warnings of rampant money-printing by global central banks -- some of which started to reveal their own interests in digital assets -- sparked fears of eventual inflation, while interest rates dipped to rock-bottom lows. That’s thrust some investors to chase returns and hedge with cryptocurrencies, pushing its price past $28,000 from around $7,200 at the start of January.

Predicting where it will go is a fraught exercise. Many left the coin for dead after its 2017 rally resulted in a crash the following year, a stretch of time sometimes referred to as the “crypto winter."" But it’s surged more than 300% in 2020 and many investors say it could continue to gain next year. A Deutsche Bank survey found a majority see it ending 2021 higher, with 41% of participants projecting a target between $20,000-$49,999 and 12% seeing it crossing above $100,000, according to Jim Reid, a strategist at the firm.

What else is on the radar? To Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital-asset manager CoinShares, there are some concerns about what the incoming Joe Biden administration might mean for the crypto space.

“Generally, I think we have had challenges with the Dems -- they prefer more regulation, more oversight,"" Demirors said. “I am a bit worried about the direction things are trending,"" especially around antitrust lawsuits and an erosion in internet privacy. Still, the industry has some allies, said Demirors, including North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry and Ohio’s Warren Davidson, who she says have been advocates for the preservation of consumer financial privacy.

Going forward, many strategists and investors say, the industry could see more scrutiny and tighter regulation with Biden in the White House.

A lot will, of course, depend on who fills key positions within the administration. Janet Yellen, who’s been nominated to serve as Treasury secretary in Biden’s administration, has in recent years cautioned investors over Bitcoin, saying it was a “highly speculative asset"" and “not a stable store of value."" A representative didn’t immediately return a request seeking comment.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Gary Gensler could be nominated to replace Jay Clayton at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Clayton’s exit from the regulator is welcome news for crypto fans who saw him take a hard line over the years, suing to halt initial coin offerings, rejecting applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and launching a last-minute lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. Gensler, who served as a Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman during the Obama administration, is a senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative and teaches about blockchain technology and digital currencies.

According to eToro’s Hirsch, there is uncertainty around how the Biden administration will approach cryptocurrencies, but the appointments are notable “because Yellen is famously anti-crypto and Gensler is known for being pro-crypto.""

“Without knowing how authorities will seek to more robustly regulate crypto in the coming years, it is hard for the markets to continue growing at the same rate they are now, especially if, as some fear, regulations aimed at curbing innovation rather than fostering it are enacted,"" said Hirsch. “Once again, clarity is the name of the game.""

Under the proposal, crypto companies would have to record and report crypto transactions above $10,000, just as banks are required to.

""There is no emergency here; there is only an outgoing administration attempting to bypass the required consultation with the public to finalize a rushed rule before their time in office is done,"" wrote Paul Grewal, Coinbase chief legal counsel, in a letter sent to FinCEN and posted on the company's blog.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In a letter sent last week to the US Treasury's FinCEN financial crimes unit, the lead lawyer at Coinbase had a simple message: ""There is no emergency here.""

Coinbase is one of several leading crypto firms pushing back against a FinCEN proposal that would require them to log personal details about the people who use cryptocurrency.

Treasury officials published a draft version of the new rules on December 18. FinCEN says the proposal would help stop money laundering, so they put in place a 15-day public comment period on the new rules.

Crypto firms say there's no reason to rush new regulations when previous comment periods sometimes lasted 30 days, 60 days, or longer.

""There is no emergency here,"" wrote Paul Grewal, Coinbase chief legal counsel, in a letter sent to FinCEN and posted on the company's blog on Dec. 21.

""[T]here is only an outgoing administration attempting to bypass the required consultation with the public to finalize a rushed rule before their time in office is done. There is also no justification for treating the cryptocurrency industry so differently from our counterparts in traditional finance,"" Grewal said.

Under the new rules, crypto firms would be required to report details for transactions over $10,000, similar to current banking regulations. Exchanges would have to record personal information for crypto holders who transfer more than $3,000 in a day, according to FinCEN.

""The rule, which applies to financial institutions and is consistent with existing requirements, is intended to protect national security, assist law enforcement, and increase transparency while minimizing impact on responsible innovation,"" Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, said in a statement.

The government says the proposed regulations would close loopholes that ""malign actors may exploit."" They say stricter regulation could stop money laundering via digital currencies.

Officials have long accused the wealthy of hiding yachts, homes, foreign bank accounts, and other such big-ticket items from tax collectors. But they've only recently started to look at cryptocurrency.

When antivirus pioneer John McAfee was indicted for tax evasion in October, for example, the charges included his digital currency holdings.

Crypto making it into the indictment was yet another signal of a broad effort currently underway by US government agencies to lasso cryptocurrency companies and traders, holding them to the same standards as currency traders and stock holders.

In a statement at the time, the US Dept. of Justice said: ""According to the indictment, McAfee allegedly evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.""

The FinCEN proposal is just the latest effort from President Donald Trump's administration to regulate cryptocurrency.

As Trump has said on Twitter, he's ""not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.""

It's a mission that has been roundly rejected by Cryptocurrency companies. In the days since FinCEN announced its plans, crypto companies have mostly said the rules would raise costs, hurt customers, and be difficult to enforce.

The rules may also affect the poor or homeless, groups that historically have had difficulty banking, said the Kraken exchange in a blog post.

""Twenty-five percent of the U.S. population is currently unbanked or underbanked. Sadly, existing requirements do indeed prohibit financial institutions from opening accounts for homeless people, refugees and others in this 25% who do not have enough money to afford a mailing address,"" the company said.

Kraken, Coinbase, and other exchanges said they need time to digest the proposal.

Kraken in its response said the 15-day public comment period is ""unprecedented"" and ""patently inappropriate"" for a regulation that would affect many people and institutions.

""Instead, in order to jam through this rule with minimal public input, FinCEN is providing only 15 days over the holiday season for the public to consider the rule's consequences, even though they know it is vulnerable to challenge,"" the company said in its unsigned blog post.",2020-12-27 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/blackrock-hiring-vp-blockchain-lead-to-drive-demand-for-firms-crypto-offerings,"Disclosure

It’s not rigorous analysis, but I hope the change in rhythm lightens the festive period.

Go ahead and laugh, but may I say in my defense that “good at rhymes” was not in my original job description.

<clears throat>

A cryptomas rhyme

‘Twas the day after Christmas. Instead of some rest

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

I decided to review how we had progressed.

The ructions in March did much to dispel

The “safe haven” myth as all prices fell.

“Black Thursday” also highlighted the danger

Of too much leverage. But things would get stranger.

We all soon grew aware of the threat of a new

Type of virus that spread. It was not “just the flu.”

As April drew round, we saw a new correlation

Between bitcoin and stocks, and a dip in inflation

As spending dried up. But the biggest shock

Was a negative oil price from way too much stock

And not enough storage. Uncertainty spread

As markets digested the changes ahead.

The official response to the looming crash

In incomes and output was to print more “cash.”

The ballooning supply of fiat to spend

Was in sharp contrast to a cap that won’t bend.

And with perfect timing did the network remind

Us that every four years the new issue declined.

Highlighted supply rules we can’t circumvent.

The spread of the virus could not be stopped.

Nor could the rise of the prices of stocks

That used tech to help people weather the shocks

Of a new way of working and seeing their friends,

In spite of the cuts in yields and dividends.

The summer saw two new trends gather speed:

Services to satisfy institutional need

For custody, platforms and products galore.

And decentralized finance had surprises in store:

A surge in the volume of trading on some

Of the platforms that had names that would become

Memes of their own. Sushi, pizza and YAMs –

While many delivered, it seems some were scams.

With part of the U.S. fighting fire after fire

As August dragged on, stock markets climbed higher.

In October, the bitcoin price started to rise

And a looming election pushed stress to new highs.

PayPal’s support for transacting in some

Crypto assets meant mainstream adoption could come.

More well-known investors came out in defense

Of a bitcoin stake held as a hedge – it made sense

In the face of the risk of growing inflation

And currency woes that could lead to stagnation.

In December, bitcoin’s correlation to gold

Has fallen almost to zero, as new narratives unfold

And the bitcoin price enters a new paradigm.

As I write this verse, it continues to climb

Toward new all-time highs. Now, I do not know

Where it goes from here, but the inflows do show

With so much going on, there is more I could say,

But this poem is already way too long, yet

I can’t leave without urging us not to forget

That the year has been hard for so many out there.

And although there is hope, we should still be aware

Of the need to be kind, and to take care

Of our health, and our loved ones. For always somewhere

There is someone whose day could be brightened with sharing

A bit of compassion, affection and caring.

With that, dear readers, I bid you good cheer!

Happy holidays, and have a hopeful New Year.

Crypto fund manager Bitwise has liquidated the XRP position it held in its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was suing the company Ripple, which maintains 55 billion XRP in escrow and releases 1 billion every month, for what it deems a years-long unregistered offering of securities. TAKEAWAY: It is not clear that the suit will prevail, as Ripple is claiming that XRP falls outside of federal securities laws. Nevertheless, it is a big deal even for investors that have no interest in XRP, since the ripple effect (sorry) of the regulatory action will touch exchanges that list the token as well as funds that hold it, such as the Bitwise product. It will also further the conversation over what is and isn’t a security, clarity which will be welcomed by the industry as a whole. At time of writing, the XRP price is 40% lower than its price a week ago.

Anthony Scaramucci’s hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, which manages approximately $9.2 billion worth of assets, filed a Form D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for what appears to be its first bitcoin-only fund. SkyBridge has already invested $25 million in this fund, which will open to new investors in early January. According to Scaramucci, MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor was the inspiration for the fund. Scaramucci also said that SkyBridge is running a full bitcoin node. TAKEAWAY: The Saylor connection is interesting in that it shows the contagion power of high-profile conviction. And you don’t often hear of institutional investors getting as deeply involved as to run a node.

Here’s a good article by JP Koning on how we applaud the entrance of institutional investors into the market, but we tend to oversimplify why they’re investing.

Mogo, a Canadian fintech listed on the Nasdaq and Toronto stock exchanges, has announced it will make a corporate investment of up to CA$1.5 million (US$1.16 million) in bitcoin, and will consider additional purchases over 2021. TAKEAWAY: I really hope we aren’t witnessing the beginning of a trend in which companies announce bitcoin interest so their share price will go up. I just fail to see the sense in announcing a massive buy before you do it – isn’t part of a company’s obligation to its shareholders to ensure it gets the best price for its acquisitions?

The original bitcoin-buying corporation, MicroStrategy, has invested all of the proceeds of its $650 million debt issuance into 29,646 more bitcoin, at an average unit price of $21,925. The business intelligence firm now has 70,470 BTC worth over $1.596 billion in its treasury reserve. TAKEAWAY: Now this makes sense, announcing after the buy has been completed. Many companies will no doubt have noticed the MicroStrategy share price performance since it dove headfirst into cryptocurrency – this could well encourage others to dive in, and not necessarily for ideological or even investment thesis reasons.",2020-12-27 22:00:30+00:00,https://decrypt.co/52733/reddit-user-makes-over-24k-in-bitcoin-by-trolling,"In brief Reddit awards Moon tokens to users who write popular posts.

The tokens can be exchanged for cash via a long and complex process.

One Redditor told users how he turned all his Moons into over $24,000-worth of Bitcoin from “memes and shitposting.”

An experienced investor has told Reddit that he turned his Moon tokens into Bitcoin to reap serious rewards—all from “memes and shitposting.”

The 31-year-old Reddit user, Cryptorich13, who claims to hold over $150,000 in Bitcoin, said in a post yesterday that he sold the Moons he earned for Bitcoin. Thanks to the surging price of Bitcoin, his earnings from posting on Reddit now equal over $24,000.

Reddit Moons, launched earlier this year, are ERC-20 tokens awarded to those who contribute to the r/CryptoCurrency section of the social media site. They run on a test version of Ethereum, called Rinkeby.

When a user writes a post others like, they upvote it. The more posts get upvoted, the more Moons users receive. Redditors can use Moons to add weight to votes in polls on the platform or tip other users.

Cryptorich13 claims his posts are so popular, he earned over 80,000 Moons since 2017. His posts include anything from ruthless investment advice (“Family, friends, loved ones should be put on the backburner this year”) to funny Bitcoin memes.

Moons were only usable within the test version of Ethereum until July, after developer Austin Griffith created a way to move the tokens from one blockchain to another.

""Some of the tools I use to trade crypto"". Image: Reddit

It’s a tad complicated but the gist of it is this: by using the MetaMask wallet, you can send the Moons to an exchange created by Griffith—the xMoon exchange. From there, the Moons will be on the xDai blockchain, a different version of the stablecoin DAI’s blockchain.

When Moons have moved to the xDai blockchain, they become xMoons. When a user has those, they can swap them on the decentralized exchange, Honeyswap, for other tokens—such as DAI or MKR—which can then be sold for cash via another exchange.

Cryptorich13 said in his post that he sold them and used the cash he earned to re-invest in Bitcoin. “I was awarded 80k reddit moons earlier this year which I sold on the Rinkeby testnet using xDai and Honeyswap and immediately bought BTC with it (0.92 BTC to be exact),” he wrote.

“I have literally made $24k from memes and shitposting.”

Cryptorich13 added that the price of Bitcoin has since gone up since he wrote the post. At the time of writing, 0.92 Bitcoin was worth $24,561.

His post attracted a lot of comments, with one user, salil19, writing: “0.9 btc is crazy to get for shitposting.”

Another, HashMoose, commented: “As a moon hodler it almost hurts me to upvote this.”

So now you know: get shitposting, Redditors.",2020-12-27 22:18:27,https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/937365/four-non-bitcoin-cryptos-to-watch-in-2021-937365.html,"While Bitcoin's dramatic rise has dominated the crypto conversation in 2020, the coming year could see more developments from the industry's lesser-known digital currencies

While the biggest story in the crypto and blockchain space across 2020 has undoubtedly been the meteoric rise in the price of Bitcoin, which has seen its value balloon by over 220% since early January.

However, investors may want to keep an eye on a selection of other, cheaper, digital currencies and tokens that have the potential to break new ground in the space in the coming year as the industry moves into the mainstream.

Ripple

Ripple is a coin attached to XRP, a blockchain that markets itself as a payments platform that allows faster and decentralised currency exchange and remittances compared to ordinary wire transfers.

While Ripple is not mineable, with the tokens instead issued by human operators rather than awarded to computers resolving transactions through algorithms like Bitcoins are, it is touted by some in the industry as a viable alternative to the wire transfer payments system, particularly for transactions in very small quantities that are normally not handled by traditional exchanges.

Ripple has also seen a sharp increase in value over the last month, rising around 107% since late November to US$0.60 each.

Litecoin

While Litecoin has lost some lustre following its emergence as the first altcoin in the early 2010s, the crypto has consistently attracted users to its platform as a faster transaction method compared to the more time-consuming nature of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Litecoin also offers a cheaper entry point for new crypto investors than the pricier Bitcoin, as despite rising 167% this year it is still trading at around US$108, less than a tenth of Bitcoin’s current price tag.

The crypto does not occupy the dominant position it used to, however, investors may want to take a second look, at the very least as a cheaper method of riding the bullish coattails of Bitcoin’s rally as institutions pour cash into the industry.

Cosmos

As blockchain technology continues to expand in popularity, more and more projects are springing up to take advantage of the system, one of which is Cosmos.

However, unlike other altcoins on the market, Cosmos aims to resolve some of the issues surrounding the scalability of different blockchain platforms and their ability to interoperate. In short, Cosmos is aiming to create an ‘internet of blockchains’ allowing them to connect and interact in a similar manner to devices on the Internet of Things.

While the token is currently on the cheaper side at around US$5 apiece, Cosmos could experience a wave of investor interest should it manage to pull of its end goal of linking blockchains together, potentially opening up whole new methods for how the technology operates and interacts with itself.

Bitcoin Cash

Despite the name being closely related with the original crypto, Bitcoin Cash is not correlated with Bitcoin itself, rather the crypto is an offshoot of the original as a result of debates between members of the crypto community on how to resolve some of the more pressing issues in the Bitcoin blockchain, namely a spike in transaction volumes slowing down their resolution speed.

Bitcoin Cash is the product of one of these solutions, known as a ‘hard fork’, where the original blockchain architecture is used to build a new blockchain, and by extension, a new cryptocurrency.

This means that Bitcoin Cash cannot be used for transactions on the original Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa. However, the offspring of Bitcoin may find itself in a similar position to Litecoin, able to piggyback off of the bullish sentiment in the industry as well as the added benefit of being able to steal some name recognition of its parent crypto.

Bitcoin Cash is also offering a cheaper option to Bitcoin, with the digital currency trading at around US$324 apiece.",2021-01-03 00:00:00

We've seen rallies fizzle out in scary fashion before. Bitcoin plummeted 74% in 2018 after a couple of monster years. However, like others, I have decided to make bitcoin a small part of my portfolio. And as a tech investor there are ways that you can participate in the crypto revolution without trading in the actual currency.

A bit of bitcoin

Over the past couple of months bitcoin-related investments have grown to account for 2% of my portfolio. It may not seem like a lot, but it's enough to afford me the potential for strong gains for the digital currency revolution without the threat of busting my portfolio if the bubble pops.

I currently own three investments marching to the beat of crypto. The first is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), the first publicly traded security investing solely in bitcoin. There's a downside to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust -- and I'll get to that shortly -- but it's my largest position. My second largest position is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a sleepy provider of enterprise analytics with a not-so-sleepy approach to capital allocation. Spoiler alert: MicroStrategy owns a lot of bitcoin.

My third and smallest position is bitcoin itself.

Let's start with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The trust has become a way for investors to buy and sell an investment that rises and falls in step with bitcoin. The problem with the trust is that it trades at a healthy premium to the bitcoin it owns. It ended last week at a 24% premium to the $22 a share it owned in bitcoin. The premium has been much higher in the past given the scarcity of the product, but that gap should narrow as more vehicles hit the market. It also may or may not help that it's never been easier to buy cryptocurrency than it is right now.

Fintech darlings Square (NYSE:SQ) and more recently PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) make it seamless to trade as little as $1 in bitcoin. Square's Cash app and now PayPal have been actively promoting access to the digital currency. Easy access to bitcoin at cost will eat into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's heady premium to the currency it owns, but the bullish counter here is that easier access will boost crypto's exposure, ownership, and ultimately prices.

MicroStrategy is wrapping up what should be its sixth consecutive year with a single-digit decline in revenue. The interesting wrinkle here is that CEO Michael Saylor has been buying bitcoin with MicroStrategy's liquidity, and it now owns a lot of crypto.

MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 29,646 bitcoins for $650 million at an average price of $21,925 per #bitcoin and now #hodl an aggregate of 70,470 bitcoins purchased for $1.125 billion at an average price of $15,964 per bitcoin.https://t.co/j6wVLXIzoa — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) December 21, 2020

We're talking about $1.125 billion in bitcoin purchases that have appreciated to $1.9 billion in value with the digital currency topping $27,000 on Sunday night. This would be a big position for a tech titan, but in this case it's a huge deal for a meandering tech company with a market cap of roughly $3 billion.

Some tech investors will prefer to own more than just the investments that have become proxies for bitcoin. Square and PayPal offer strong upside as leading payment platforms that just happen to have a bitcoin kicker. There are also pick-and-shovel plays in the form of bitcoin mining companies and blockchain stocks that should thrive if the platform continues to climb as it gains wider acceptance.

More ways to have some skin in the bitcoin game will come. The market never ignores a booming trend for too long. Corrections will be inevitable, but volatility can also be an ally for risk-tolerant investors. Buckle up, bitcoin investors. It's a bumpy road ahead in 2021, but investors keep showing up in 2020.",2020-12-28 00:00:00,https://www.tradestation.com/insights/2020/12/28/monex-sentiment-survey-crypto/,"An international investor survey shows rising sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and optimism toward U.S. stocks.

Monex, the Tokyo-based parent of TradeStation Group, just issued a poll of investors in Japan, the United States and Hong Kong. It was conducted in late November and covered a variety of issues. Here are some key findings:

Interest is rising toward cryptocurrencies.

Investors are most bullish on the U.S.

Chinese investors are getting bullish more quickly.

Investors Are More Interested in Cryptocurrencies

Several questions showed more interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is the newest part of the survey, having begun in mid-2017.

First, 38.2 percent of U.S. investors either bought or are considering buying cryptos. That’s up 12.4 percentage points from a year ago. Smaller increases occurred in Japan and Hong Kong.

Second, dislike is down. Just 43.5 percent of U.S. investors said they’re “not interested in cryptocurrencies,” compared with 60.3 percent a year earlier. Japanese and Hong Kong-based investors expressed similar views.

Dow Jones Industrial Average, daily chart, with 50-day moving average.

Investors Are Most Bullish on the U.S.

Investors in all three locations were most bullish on U.S. stocks, however they saw considerable risk of a pullback in 2021.

Over 63 percent of domestic investors think U.S. markets will perform best in the first quarter. (In comparison to Japan, Europe and Asia excluding Japan.) Smaller majorities of Japanese traders (52.3 percent) and Hong Kong respondents (50.6 percent) agreed.

A separate question about the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed caution. Most U.S. investors see the index falling under 28,000, translating into a pullback of at least 8 percent. Most Japanese investors expect a drop below 25,000, while Hong Kong respondents targeted a low under 23,000.

In contrast, most investors across all three regions see the Dow’s high at 33,000 next year. That implies less than 10 percent of upside, but most investors anticipating at least 17 percent of downside from current levels.

Sentiment Is Rising Fastest in Hong Kong

Another part of the study was the diffusion index. That’s the percentage of people saying global stocks will rise minus the proportion saying they will fall.

The forecast diffusion index showed sentiment little changed in the U.S. and Japan. However in Hong Kong, it rose by 41 percentage points. The stronger reading shows sentiment swinging in a bullish direction in the Chinese financial hub. It comes amid expectations of less trade tension with the U.S. and a quicker rebound from the pandemic in Mainland China.

In conclusion, Monex’s survey shows cautious optimism in the U.S., Hong Kong and Japan. The biggest takeaway could be rising interest in cryptocurrencies — especially because the data was collected three weeks before Bitcoin broke out to new highs.",2020-12-28 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/india-lending-vauld-crypto-bank,"Singapore-based lending platform Vauld raised $2 million, led by Pantera Capital, to grow into a full crypto bank. Other investors include Coinbase Ventures, LuneX Ventures and individual investors including Robert Leshner of Compound Finance.

This is part of a larger story of crypto firms seeking their own banking charters to operate as crypto-native banks. Recently, stablecoin issuer and crypto services firm Paxos and crypto payments firm BitPay filed to become federally regulated banks in the U.S.

So far, Vauld has established a foothold in India, where a favorable ruling from the courts earlier this year has unleashed a flood of crypto activity.

“Hiring is the focus of the hour in the Indian market,” Vauld co-founder and CTO Sanju Sony Kurian said in a statement.

The company, formerly known as Bank of Hodlers, will use the funds to expand from lending and borrowing to become a holistic banking platform that also includes payments and trading. Vauld also seeks to broaden its presence in Europe and the U.S.

“We see institutional capital come into the crypto space with the expectation of banking integrations to complement crypto credit offerings,” CEO Darshan Bathija said in a statement.

The company’s immediate aims include implementing an over-the-counter (OTC) desk, fiat and crypto order books, and debit and credit cards for multiple countries. The goal is for users to do all their banking on a blockchain.

Vauld goes international

Vauld intends to expand licensing across international crypto hubs including Singapore and the U.K. in the next 24 months. Bathija told CoinDesk via Telegram his company is also looking at Wyoming following the precedent of Kraken Financial and Avanti Financial.

This comes after a year in which two banking charters were approved by the Wyoming State Banking Board, granting Kraken and Avanti official status as chartered banks in the state. Vauld sees higher demand for banking functionalities for crypto assets.

Bathija said most regulators want businesses to first prove they have the governance structure to operate in full compliance, given how new crypto companies are in general. They urge companies to get lending and money transmission licenses first and “wait for a year until we start applying for the banking license,” he said.

Since its earlier investment of $500,000 from LuneX Ventures and a few angel investors in June, Vauld saw 950% growth, according to the company. Bathija said that is a “clear indication that yield products are valued and expected both in the U.S. and abroad.”",2020-12-28 18:00:20+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in 2020, this paradigm seemed to have shifted. What has emerged is a shared recognition that Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets are here to stay and that they will play a key role in the future of global finance.

This is not some far-fetched vision reserved to crypto-anarchists — financial actors that were traditionally wary of cryptocurrencies are now expressing confidence in their disruptive potential. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, for instance, have recently reversed their initial opposition to cryptocurrencies, becoming some of the latest to offer new banking services and offerings for the digital assets market.

As optimism and appreciation for the long term potential of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, so will the opportunities for revenue expansion among players within the ecosystem. Bitcoin miners, for instance, saw their topline figures surge by close to 50% on a month-on-month basis in November, as Bitcoin prices rallied more than 60% to above $18,000 over the same time period. Yet, in a highly competitive environment, success has largely been confined to a few industry leaders while remaining elusive to many.

For miners, gaining access to highly advanced mining equipment — one that boasts the highest level of power and cost efficiencies, and the fastest processing speeds — remains the single most critical factor to securing a competitive edge.

The evolution

The crypto mining industry has undergone a succession of substantial transformations to arrive at today’s advanced technical state. In its early days, mining was done using simple computers without any complex or high-powered devices. General-purpose central processing units, or CPUs, were all it took to produce Bitcoin. This led to a rapid expansion of the Bitcoin network, as the allure of easy money prompted an influx of new entrants — so much so that these first-generation miners were unable to keep pace with demand, rendering them obsolete in just a year’s time.

Graphics processing units were introduced next and made mining Bitcoin more efficient and profitable. Combining several GPUs became a common sight, as miners sought to further increase their mining performance and capabilities while maximizing gains. Despite these advancements, second-generation miners did not stand the test of time due to their high energy consumption and lack of long-term efficacy.

In 2011, field-programmed gate arrays, or FPGAs, emerged as the next logical step of progression. They were fast, highly energy-efficient, offered better performance and easier cooling than their predecessors. Nonetheless, FPGA miners were short-lived and eventually replaced by ASICs, which, until today, remain the dominant technology for the Bitcoin mining industry. Designed, built and optimized for the sole purpose of mining, ASICs are recognized for their superior harmonization of power consumption, performance and cost — around a million times more energy efficient and 50 million times faster in mining Bitcoin than the CPUs used in 2009.

The road ahead

Indeed, crypto mining has come a long way. Aside from performance-related developments, there have also been notable improvements to the environmental aspect of the technology, such as higher energy efficiency and faster hash rates. With a growing emphasis on sustainability, this is a trend likely to continue as chip design providers look to develop innovative solutions to cater to this evolving demand.

Two main developmental areas come to mind. First, the reengineering of current mining hardware to radically utilize less energy; and, second, a reprogramming of current mining chips to allow the use of hybrid energy for optimal cost performance.

Reengineering of the current mining hardware. Already, there are several concepts out in the market that are being researched and rigorously put to test — one of them being the use of photonic chips to perform computing. In theory, the technology appears promising, with two to three orders of magnitude better energy efficiency over current electronic processors. Yet, in reality, it remains inconclusive as to whether the power savings are realizable, particularly as Bitcoin scales. Until then, ASICs and their ongoing enhancements will continue to dominate the crypto mining space and lead the charge on energy efficiency in crypto mining.

Reprogramming of the current mining chips. Against common belief, the crypto mining industry is a relatively green one. As of December 2019, Bitcoin was powered by over 70% of renewable electricity. While the benefits of using renewables are undisputed, the truth is that renewables are an intermittent source of energy and are not always reliable for Bitcoin miners, who have a constant energy requirement. Fossil fuel-based power, on the contrary, serves generally as a more steady source of energy. To strike a balance between the sustainability of the industry and sustainability more broadly, a hybrid model can be adopted, whereby renewables are used predominantly as an energy source, with fossil fuel-based power setting in during production shortages. This entails redesigning and reprogramming current mining chips to enable greater ease of toggling between the two variants of energy sources, with no disruption to the mining processes.

As cryptocurrencies continue to rise in prominence, so will the influx of competition from new providers wanting a slice of the pie. Healthy competition can be positive in that it can lead to more innovation that brings greater efficiencies and maturity to the industry. To fully capitalize on the growth of the nascent cryptocurrency market, however, incumbent chip designers will need to invest further into research and development, particularly in areas of energy optimization and power performance.

Unfortunately, the headline isn’t true. “Not accurate,” an NFL spokesperson tells me, adding that “his people are converting some of the money into bitcoin” after he gets paid in US dollars, just like every other NFL player.

More like “NFL player decides to spend half his salary on bitcoin”

Okung’s own team, the Carolina Panthers, also confirmed to The Verge that teams pay their players in US dollars.

By that standard, anyone can get their salary “paid in bitcoin” anytime they want: just go buy some bitcoin with your salary after it arrives, which is probably what the company that Okung is pumping — Zap — is hoping you’ll do when you see he’s repping it online.

It’s not clear why Okung chose this particular startup to convert his paycheck (it does accept direct deposit), or why he’s tweeted 14 times this afternoon encouraging his followers to hop on board the bitcoin and Zap train.

He doesn’t disclose any kind of relationship with Zap on Twitter, although Zap founder Jack Mallers does call him a “friend.” (Mallers didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.)

But even if Okung doesn’t have a deal of some sort with Zap, he would have some financial incentive simply by being a Bitcoin investor — the more people get excited enough to buy gobs of bitcoin, the higher the price, and the more his stake is worth. (Okung converted half of his $13 million salary to bitcoin, according to the Coindesk report.)

To generate that kind of excitement, it helps to have headlines like “First NFL player to be paid in bitcoin” spread around the web. It certainly sounds more intriguing than “NFL player decides to spend 50 percent of his salary on Bitcoin,” right? It’ll be interesting to see if any of those headlines change overnight.",2020-12-29 00:00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-29/bitcoin-hits-new-high-but-cryptocurrency-s-future-is-uncertain,"Why did this happen?

But even more extraordinary than the cultural shift itself, is the fact that Britain’s industrialization remained way ahead of potential competition for decades. Only in the early 1900s did historians come to grips with the issues of causation. Max Weber’s pithy answer, “the Protestant work ethic,” pointed to Puritan seriousness, diligence, fiscal prudence and hard work. Others point to the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 as a foundation for financial stability.

In contrast, continental Europe lurched from one national debt crisis to another, then threw itself headlong into the Napoleonic wars. Unsurprisingly, it was not until after 1815 that industrialization took place on the European mainland, where it was spearheaded by the new country of Belgium.

250 years later, another revolution has begun with the launch of Bitcoin (BTC), but this one is more commercial in nature than industrial. Though the full impact has yet to play out, the parallels between these two historical events are already striking.

Bitcoin may not match the obviousness of industrialization, but the underlying pragmatics touch on the very foundations of the non-barter economy. Like the establishment of the Bank of England, the creation of the cryptocurrency infrastructure has been prompted by ongoing and worsening threats to financial stability: systemic fault-lines created by macroeconomic challenges stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.

If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em...right?

Where a central bank once anchored financial enlightenment, it now plays the role of antagonist. For those who could “connect the dots” in 2008, there was the realization that central banks no longer existed as guardians and protectors of national currencies, but rather as tools for creating politicized market distortions, abandoning their duty to preserve wealth in favor of creating the conditions for limitless, cheap government debt. While many of the underlying intentions were benign, the process inherently worked to punish savers and reward reckless debt.

Meanwhile, it has steadily taken time for the potential of digital assets to reach their potential and approach something like critical mass, though thankfully full acceptance shouldn’t take as long as Britain’s industrial revolution. Over the past 12 years, cryptocurrencies have moved from unknown to novel to significant, growing interest. As a result, profound changes are underway, affecting the mechanics by which investors, the investment industry, wealth managers and even the commercial banking sector are engaging with cryptocurrencies.

This interest has accelerated as we enter into a period of deep economic uncertainty and growing awareness that structural soundness is shifting away from traditional investment options. Not only that, this growing financial innovation and public interest has largely occurred outside of the central banks’ control, if not outright antagonism led by the banks’ regulatory arms in government.

Now, many central banks are trying to join a game they’ve tried almost every way of beating, with digital currencies that adopt the glowing sheen of crypto innovation, but which also eschew the underlying innovations and philosophy that made those innovations so popular to begin with.

Follow or get out of the way

The popularity of cryptocurrency has largely been due to its protean fungibility — it has been whatever the independent financial community has needed it to be, from digital currency to speculative financial instruments to smart contracts that can power smart financial technology.

However hard central banks might try to co-opt the hype of cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency succeeding will mark the fundamental end of critical aspects of the central banking monopoly by offering a more competitive vehicle for facilitating commercial transactions and providing a more stable medium to store monetized assets. Cryptocurrencies actually offer real returns on “cash” deposits, something that the fiat banking system has long since abandoned. Most of all, cryptocurrencies reveal the fictitious nature of fiat currencies as a principle.

Cryptocurrencies as an ecosystem will increasingly constrain, redirect and set the parameters for government macroeconomic policies. Certainly, sound alternatives to fiat currencies will drive the latter to the periphery of commercial life, concomitantly reducing the number of tools the nation-state has at its disposal to regulate or respond to changing economic conditions. Above all, this means that government financial engagement can no longer be a rule unto itself. It will have to engage by the same principles as everyone else. A level playing field here has dramatic implications.

Against the backdrop of the essential limits of fiat currencies, current geo- and macroeconomic policies and a new emerging world order, cryptocurrencies offer vast potential as an efficiency facilitating frictionless commerce and investment, a medium of stability against uncertainty and inflation, increased security in value transfer and wealth management, optimum autonomy in an increasingly intrusive climate, and “cash” asset preservation/growth in a world of negative interest rates.

The edifice that supports the concept of a “global reserve currency” is also weakening. This will reduce political influence over global finance, as well as nations’ abilities to run a long-term balance of payments deficits, current account deficits and borrow at little or no interest. Indeed, given current trends, changes in trading mechanics may speedily evolve to the point that such “reserve currencies” no longer have a function at all. And cryptocurrency success will hasten the end of the U.S. dollar monopoly in global commerce.

If you pay attention to the incremental change that occurs year after year, you realize everything is connected and you can foresee some exciting outcomes. 2021 will undoubtedly be a year for blockchain and crypto to take center stage economically, politically and socially.

Andrew Keys is Managing Partner at Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors and the co-founder of LiquidStake, a solution to the liquidity problem of Ethereum 2.0. Formerly, Keys was the head of Global Business Development at ConsenSys.

1. In 2020, the world started to understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin as “digital gold.” In 2021, we will witness the same understanding of Ethereum as “digital oil.”

In the next year, Ethereum will solidify its place as the future substrate of the global digital economy by underwriting the world’s contracts.

Contracts are the connective tissue of the world – sales contracts, college acceptances, employment offers, insurance policies, medical prescriptions, NDAs, ISDA agreements, etc. Yes, Earth runs on contracts (not on Dunkin’). Ethereum allows contracts to go truly digital. The digitization of the contract is the digitization of the global economy, which has been valued at an estimated $270 trillion (compared to the $18 trillion market cap of gold that bitcoin stands to capture). Ethereum has the opportunity to upgrade entire economies, not just one asset class.

2. Ethereum 2.0 phase 1 will successfully occur.

On Dec. 1, the Ethereum community successfully launched phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0. The network upgrade from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake will make Ethereum scale and run faster with less computing power. In 2021, we will see phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0 go live, drastically improving scalability.

3. Bitcoin will reach $50K.

Bitcoin has a singular use case with a limited supply. As more institutional investors continue to buy bitcoin, the price will surge to $50,000.

4. Ether will reach $2K.

The Eth 2.0 upgrade will catapult the network’s capability and garner even more attention from enterprises and institutional investors, driving the price of the ether currency to new heights.

5. Total DeFi locked will exceed $150 billion and 2021 will be the year of DeFi cross-chain bridges.

It is undeniable that Ethereum is home to the majority of decentralized finance activity. But other networks will enter the space in a more material way, putting other native tokens to work in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. With the various tokenized bitcoin options (tBTC, ren, wBTC) growing in popularity, we will see bitcoin’s $430 billion market cap collateralized in DeFi. This will grow the TVL in DeFi exponentially.

6. As Web 3.0 gains traction, the value will accrue in the protocol layers, rather than the application layers.

In Web 2.0, the majority of the value lies in the application layer of the stack. The largest internet company on the planet is not the company that maintains the HTTP protocol, it’s the company that provides the most valued and entrenched experience to the end user. In Web 3.0, the scope of the application layer will shrink and we will witness protocol infrastructure provide the most value.

7. Layer 2 will explode.

In 2021, Ethereum will continue to cement its position as the leading layer 1 blockchain. As with any technology stack, there are many layers that make up an application. With Ethereum as the base layer, we will see an explosion of layer 2 solutions that will augment the Ethereum mainnet with unique features: scalability, privacy, interoperability and more.

DeFi has grown on Ethereum at an exponential rate, causing gas fees to skyrocket and transactions to slow. Advancements in layer 2 technologies will provide a scaling solution for all of the microtransactions that do not need to happen on mainnet. So 2021 will be a breakthrough year for projects like ZK-Rollups and Optimism (shout-out to Jinglan Wang) as more dapps turn to layer 2 solutions like state channels to increase transaction throughput up to 100 to 2,000 transactions-per-second (TPS).

8. IPFS and Filecoin will step into the global spotlight.

In 2016, IBM said that 90% of the world’s data was created in the prior two years alone. That was four years ago, when the world generated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Every internet connected device on Earth –smartphones, smart TV’s, computers, cars – is generating data. As the amount of data generated grows exponentially year after year, so will the need for storage that is cheap, accessible and permissionless. The options we have for data storage today stand in stark contrast to the needs of tomorrow, and enterprises and consumers alike will begin to understand the limitations of existing solutions.

Enter IPFS and Filecoin. IPFS and Filecoin are complementary layer 1 protocols that work in tandem to provide decentralized storage. Since its mainnet launch in October, Filecoin storage has surpassed 1 exbibyte of capacity (that’s a colossal amount). Bridges between Ethereum, IFPS and Filecoin are already underway and in 2021 we will see entire workflows – from agreements and transactions to data storage and sharing – executed using decentralized protocols.

9. ‘Ethereum killers’ will need to find a niche or will be slaughtered.

For years, various layer 1 blockchains have marketed themselves as “Ethereum killers.” Many have promised a faster and more sophisticated smart contract platform with little to show for it. In 2021, those that have raised millions on the promise of capturing Ethereum’s market share will need to carve out a niche use case for their platforms or risk becoming irrelevant before any code has been shipped. Ethereum’s dominance is comparable to Google’s share of search, and other protocols are contributing to this hegemonic position by building cross-chain bridges as one of their first integrations. These layer 1s will likely gain momentum for specific use cases or technological preferences, such as NEAR with gaming, or Dfinity with its use of WebAssembly instead of Solidity.

Ethereum might lose a small percentage of projects, but even as new open source ecosystems emerge around these other protocols all roads will lead back to Ethereum as the base settlement layer.

10. We will see the beginning of crypto IPO mania.

BlockFi, Celsius and Coinbase (it’s already happening!) will file for an initial public offering. Within a year, the valuation of Coinbase will rise upwards of $40 billion. These companies should tokenize an aspect of the IPO and launch a digital security, as many of them built their success on the promise of usurping the very systems they will now join.

11. China will go live with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).

Tens of thousands of people have already tried the new digital currency and the rollout will continue leading up to the 2022 Olympics. An international financial hub like Singapore, Switzerland or Hong Kong will be the second country to issue a CBDC.

12. The U.S. will continue to delay its work on a CBDC as a dozen other countries are steadfast in their pursuit of a digital currency.

The U.S. has been paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic and a tumultuous presidential election cycle and will spend much of 2021 dealing with the economic repercussions of the pandemic. Stimulus will continue to be distributed in slow, analog fashion, even as the use case for a government-issued digital currency becomes increasingly evident.

13. We will witness the first areas of significant enterprise adoption on public blockchains.

Led by industry pioneers like Yorke Rhodes of Microsoft, Paul Brody of EY and John Wolpert of ConsenSys, the open-source Baseline protocol employing public Ethereum mainnet to connect enterprise blockchains to Ethereum’s public network using peer-to-peer messaging and zero-knowledge cryptography.

14. NFTs will emerge as the leading consumer use case for Ethereum.

In November, the record for highest value nonfungible token (NFT) was set at approximately $141,536.20 for a medieval interpretation of Vitalik Buterin. That record was shattered just days after. NFTs have long been touted as a promising solution to counterfeit goods. In 2021, we will see the popularization of NFTs as digital representations of unique goods, from art to music to collectibles. Innovators like SuperRare and Sorare will be the market leaders in their respective industries. Kids will trade NFTs of European Football League stars in the same way kids used to trade baseball cards.

15. Crypto VC will explode.

Venture capital investment in Web 3.0 and crypto companies has steadily increased in the last five years, but 2021 will be a breakout year, catalyzed by the next generation of crypto VCs. Consider the 100-person Silicon Valley VC that has a few people specializing in blockchain technology.

Coin Metrics has noted that many researchers have looked into the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and other major asset classes. The crypto research firm pointed out that “juxtapositions of Bitcoin and established commodities such as gold continue to lure swarms of newcomers into this industry, institutional and retail-alike.”

Coin Metrics added:

“As the first-ever successful implementation of a digital currency, it’s common to see Bitcoin serve as a punching bag for technologists. To many of them, Bitcoin is a first-generation technology and, as such, it is plagued by a lack of transactional throughput and feature richness. But make no mistake: Bitcoin’s uniqueness goes far beyond the scope of technology. It is an unprecedented experiment in wealth distribution.”

Many major institutions and large publicly listed firms like Square, PayPal, and MicroStrategy have entered the Bitcon (BTC) and digital asset space this year.

As 2020 comes to an end, NexTech AR Solutions (OTCQB: NEXCF) (CSE: NTAR) (FSE: N29), an established provider of virtual and augmented reality (AR) experience technologies and services for eCommerce, education, conferences and events, announced that it intends to make an initial investment of $2 million in Bitcoin and might add more next year.

National Football League (NFL) player Russell Okung recently revealed that he will be receiving part of his salary in Bitcoin. The professional athlete had first tweeted in May of last year that he wanted to get paid in the digital currency. He has now become the very first player from any major American sports league to receive his salary in Bitcoin.

While Bitcoin adoption and price has reached historic levels this year, it’s not the only cryptocurrency project that has made substantial gains during 2020, which has seen the COVID-19 outbreak lead to socioeconomic uncertainty and record levels of money printing by reserve banks. Ethereum (ETH), the world’s largest platform for building decentralized applications (dApps), has managed to introduce Ethereum 2.0, which is a very gradual system-wide upgrade to (hopefully) a faster, more efficient blockchain network.

Anthony Sassano, the developer of Ethhub, an informational resource for all things Ethereum, noted that he had predicted earlier this year that the Eth2 phase 0 would have a strong launch (back in January 2020). He confirmed that Ethereum has had “a frozen spec, multiple testnets running, a more concrete rollout plan and a community eager to make eth2 phase 0 happen in 2020.”

He also mentioned that he had predicted that we’d see daily (decentralized or non-custodial crypto exchange) DEX volumes at $1 billion in 2020. Sassano confirmed that DEXs are regularly doing $1 billion+ per day now with total monthly volumes reaching $20 billion+.

He continued:

“For my next prediction I was way too conservative by saying that USD locked in DeFi would only exceed $5 billion – it ended up growing to $15 billion+. At the time I made the prediction TVL in DeFi was sitting at around $800 million (around January 2020) so obviously I wasn’t bullish enough on DeFi here. …I had no way of knowing that yield farming and liquidity mining would become a thing and that’s actually what ended up catapulting DeFi’s growth to insane levels.”

He added:

“I predicted that scaling/layer 2 would rapidly mature in 2020 and that’s exactly what it did. Though, we didn’t see as much layer 2 adoption as I had hoped for but I think 2021 will be the year for that as we have Synthetix’s Optimism implementation going live, the Uniswap v3 launch that is rumored to come with some sort of layer 2 scaling and I know of many other top DeFi protocols that are formulating layer 2 scaling strategies. As for existing technology, we have the Dark Forest game living on the xDAI sidechain, prediction markets such as Polymarket and Augur living on Matic Network, Loopring and DeversiFi living on zkRollups and more. All in all 2020 was an amazing year for Ethereum scaling.”

Sassano also mentioned that he thought 20% of all Ethereum (ETH) transactions would take place “privately.” While this prediction didn’t come true, he expects privacy to become “more widely adopted” on Ethereum in 2021. He added that tools such as Tornado Cash are being increasingly used through their liquidity mining program and there’s a good chance people start taking privacy a lot more seriously because of increased regulations from world governments.",2020-12-17 00:00:00,https://www.investopedia.com/coinbase-to-suspend-xrp-trading-5093844,"Coinbase will suspend trading and deposits in XRP (XRPUSD), the world's third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, starting Jan. 19, 2021. The San Francisco-based exchange cited the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to file a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, Inc., the company responsible for issuing XRP, for its decision. It also announced in a blogpost yesterday that trading in XRP will move to limit-only, meaning crypto traders will only be able to place limit orders on the cryptocurrency, starting tonight.

Crypto traders will be able to withdraw and access XRP in their wallet even after the trading suspension. Coinbase also said that it will support the distribution of free Spark tokens, which provide smart contract functionality to XRP, equal to the XRP amount in customer wallets on Dec. 12. The airdrop, the term used to describe such distribution events, is expected to occur at a future date.

""We will continue to monitor legal developments related to XRP and update our customers as more information becomes available,"" Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, wrote in the post.

Key Takeaways Coinbase will suspend trading and deposits in Ripple's XRP starting Jan. 19.

The decision by the San Francisco-based exchange may be related to its recent filing to go public.

The Business and Legal Considerations for Coinbase

Ripple's XRP has faced blowback from within the crypto ecosystem, and its price has crashed after the SEC filed a case against it. The complaint charges XRP's backers with conducting an unlawful issuance of securities and personally profiting from the endeavor.

Coinbase is the third exchange to take action against XRP in recent days. Belgium-based Bitstamp earlier announced that it was halting all trading and deposit operations related to XRP from Jan 8. OKCoin, another San Francisco-based exchange, has also stated that it will suspend XRP trading and deposits starting Jan. 4.

However, Coinbase's case is notable because it is the first major exchange to suspend XRP. Coinbase is North America's biggest crypto trading exchange and recently filed with the SEC to go public.

Some experts have said that the exchange's decision to toe the agency's line is because it does not want to be on the wrong side of compliance at such a critical juncture in its history. The Digital Asset Framework used by Coinbase to evaluate listing for a token states that an asset should not be classified as a security using the company's securities law framework. That framework uses elements of the Howey Test, used by the SEC to determine whether a token is a security or not, to determine the legal status of a token.

Those legal considerations are also entwined with business interests. According to some estimates, XRP accounts for a major chunk of trading volume at Coinbase. Delisting or suspending XRP trading could potentially mean a loss of revenue for the exchange. While it has never disclosed its finances publicly, previous estimates have assumed that a large portion of the outfit's revenue comes from trading operations.",2020-12-30 19:17:12.451000+00:00,https://www.investopedia.com/sec-freezes-crypto-hedge-fund-assets-5093865,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged New York-based crypto hedge fund Virgil Capital with securities fraud and frozen its assets.

The agency's complaint stated that the fund's founder, 23-year-old Stefan Qin, with engaging ""in a deceptive course of conduct, using materially false and misleading statements to investors and others"" and causing harm to two crypto funds – the Sigma fund and the VQR fund – marketed by his company. ""This emergency action is an important step to protect investor assets and prevent further harm,"" stated Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit.

Key Takeaways The SEC has charged a crypto hedge fund with securities fraud and frozen its assets.

Virgil Capital was a prominent hedge fund that raked in investors and cash after the 2017 bull run in crypto.

According to the complaint, Qin made material misrepresentations regarding the fund to investors. For example, he claimed that the Sigma fund had invested millions of dollars across 39 trading platforms, including those in the United States, to take advantage of price arbitrage opportunities between exchanges operating in different jurisdictions.

However, the SEC claims that this was not the case. ""In reality, the Sigma Fund held no assets at any of those U.S.-based platforms, and the purported platform account balances were fabricated,"" the complaint states. Meanwhile, Qin used investor funds for personal purposes and for other ""undisclosed high-risk investments."" He also disallowed investors from redeeming their balances, instead convincing them to transfer their balances from the Sigma fund to the VQR fund, thereby keeping their balances in the system. ""The complaint alleges that no funds were transferred and the redemption requests remain outstanding,"" the agency stated in a press release.

The SEC's action against Virgil Capital occurs at a time of increased attention and mainstream spotlight on cryptocurrencies due to skyrocketing prices of major crypto assets. Several crypto hedge funds sprouted in the aftermath of a similar bull run back in 2018. Many folded in subsequent years after cryptocurrency markets swerved into a prolonged slump starting in late 2018.

Qin's fund, which was founded in 2016, was covered in The Wall Street Journal and featured on CNBC. In the interview, he claimed to have proprietary algorithmic trading strategies that allowed his fund to ""gobble up"" price differences between exchanges ""before anyone else gets there.""

According to an April report in online publication The Block, Virgil Capital had $100 million in assets under management.

The company opened a venue for cryptocurrency mining on one of its oil drilling sites in Siberia, unlocking the power of Russia’s oil and gas resources for the needs of bitcoin mining.

Gazprom, a company that counts the Russian government as a shareholder, is the country’s gas monopolist and world’s 10th-biggest oil producer. The company has been spearheading several mega-projects of cross-border gas pipelines such as the Nord Stream and the South Stream, which bring Russian gas to Europe.

Gazpromneft is a direct subsidiary of Gazprom and one of the very few government-owned companies in Russia that has openly expressed interest in the crypto mining industry. Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported that Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear power monopolist, is opening up its energy supplies for miners, too.

The venue, located in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of northwestern Siberia, is using the associated gas from its oil field as an energy source and has its own power plant transforming the gas into electricity.

The CO2 that gets freed during the oil drilling is normally a liability for oil companies as they have to burn it into the atmosphere, which results in fines. However, there are ways to utilize it instead of wasting it, and electricity generation is one of them.

In cryptocurrency mining, one of the greatest costs is for the electricity needed to power the mining rigs. By locating mining operations at oil drilling sites where there’s abundant gas to provide virtually free electricity, both miners and the oil companies benefit. By doing this, Gazpromneft is following the lead of the North American companies Upstream Data and Crusoe Energy Systems that are making use of gas at drilling sites in the U.S. and Canada.

Although Gazpromneft is not planning to mine for crypto itself, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk it’s ready to open its energy resources to miners and has already piloted a small-scale mining operation with the mining firm Vekus this past autumn.

Vekus placed a shipping container housing 150 units of Bitmain’s Antminer S9 ASICs on the site, Gazpromneft announced via the Russian crypto news outlet Forklog, and in one month the machines mined 1.8 BTC using 49,500 cubic meters of gas.",2020-12-30 13:12:34+00:00,https://www.ft.com/content/e846c8f6-6ff0-4e2f-a95f-f32043558315,"Become an FT subscriber to read:

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, widely believed to be the man taking humanity to Mars and building a permanent settlement there, tweeted his approval of the idea that Mars’ economy will run on cryptocurrency.

Elon Musk Envisions Mars’ Economy Run on Cryptocurrency

Elon Musk believes that Mars’ economy will be run on cryptocurrency. He said early this month that he is “highly confident” that his company Spacex will land humans on Mars “about six years from now.” He further noted that it could even come as early as 2024 “if we get lucky.” Musk previously said that his aim is to set up a “self-sustaining city on Mars as soon as possible.”

The subject of cryptocurrency running Mars’ economy briefly came up on Twitter last week. AI researcher Lex Fridman tweeted, “Mars economy will run on crypto.” In response, Twitter handle Elon’s World suggested, “Marscoin.” Musk himself replied with just a “Yes.”

It is not clear if Musk was referring to the cryptocurrency called “marscoin” that was launched in 2014 or if he was just talking about a future project with the same name. The existing project was launched for the purpose of becoming a Martian currency, according to its project page. Its code was a fork of Litecoin, and it originally traded on Nova Exchange. However, after peaking during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, its price dropped sharply and the coin was delisted from Nova soon afterward. Furthermore, Nova Exchange officially closed for business on Jan. 28.

Musk has also recently been talking about two other substantially more popular cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and dogecoin. Last week, he pondered the idea of his company Tesla putting billions of dollars into BTC, as suggested by the CEO of Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy which now has about 70,470 BTC in its treasury. Musk asked, “Are such large transactions even possible?” He also tweeted about dogecoin a number of times over the years. Until very recently, his Twitter profile displayed: “Former CEO of Dogecoin.”

Spacex said in October that it will not be recognizing any international law on Mars. Its Starlink internet project’s terms of service state: “For services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonization spacecraft, the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities. Accordingly, disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.”

The chief global strategist of Morgan Stanley Investment Management even suggested that Bitcoin could replace the dollar as a global reserve currency.

Cryptocurrency serves some useful purposes. But there are some pretty wild speculations going around. One of the more fundamental problems is that crypto assets can be either useful hedges or useful forms of payment, but not easily both.

There is a demand for a non-intermediated, direct payment asset, and crypto can serve that function. That is why stablecoins, such as crypto assets pegged to the dollar, have proven of enduring interest. People want to transfer something dollar-denominated but with crypto-like features. Yet the very stability of these coins means they have to create institutional layers to preserve their value. For the foreseeable future, the institutions building dollar-linked stablecoins will be riskier, less transparent and more difficult to deal with than the dollar-based system itself, including the surrounding banks.

If you hold or trade with a stablecoin, you incur several risks. First, the stablecoin peg to the dollar may someday be broken, an old problem with pegged exchange rates that Milton Friedman often warned about. Second, to the extent stablecoins and other crypto assets become a major part of the financial system, they will attract more regulatory interest. That in turn will limit many of their advantages over the traditional bank sector. The US government does not want a financial system that evolves outside the purview of the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other regulatory institutions.

Third, the formal banking sector will improve, for instance by moving to more rapid clearing, or by introducing electronic reserve currencies. With the latter, you could transfer your electronically-based dollars within the accounting system of the central bank, and achieve a non-intermediated transfer without resorting to crypto. It is not obvious that cryptocurrencies will be market winners once more mainstream institutions learn some lessons from their success.

Alternatively, consider crypto assets, such as Bitcoin or Ether, which are not pegged to major national currencies. They are useful hedges and speculation vehicles, but you probably would not want to use them as your dominant means of purchase. If they can go up in value so rapidly, they can fall too, sometimes precipitously. That’s okay if you’re using crypto assets for a modest portion of your purchases. But it’s too risky to make them the bulk of your checking and savings accounts. The dollar, euro or, for that matter, the Mexican peso are not nearly so volatile.

Imagine that virtual reality takes off, and there are economies inside virtual reality, spanning many nations. A crypto asset might be a more convenient means of payment within those networks than the dollar, if only because of the cumbersome reporting requirements for larger dollar transfers. Still, the motive for using that same crypto asset to purchase your next Toyota, or to borrow from your bank to start a restaurant, is less than clear.

Some enthusiasts postulate a world where crypto transactions are not transparent to governments, allowing buyers and sellers to live outside the tax system. Such anonymity is technologically possible, and the current black- and grey-market uses of crypto (for instance, getting funds out of China) are likely to continue.

But if most of your economic life is in the physical world, and if you own wealth within a country, such as real estate and registered equity shares, the idea that you would be able to evade most taxes is a myth. If anything, the trend is for major technology companies to cooperate with tax collection, and at any rate governments can always change from taxing transactions to taxing wealth. Crypto tax evasion is better suited to be a fringe rather than mainstream endeavour.

The recent run-up in crypto values seems to be driven by the possibility that major corporations will start adding them to their balance sheets. If you imagine crypto being treated like gold, and constituting , say, 0.5% of many balance sheets, that would imply a high price for the major crypto assets. Yet these corporations will want institutionalized, mainstream crypto assets, and they will not mind the notion of more heavily regulated crypto assets and crypto-linked financial institutions.

The more utopian scenarios for crypto, whether its proponents realize it or not, rely on the notion that it remains simultaneously fringe and mainstream. That will be a hard trick to pull off.

Het jaar dat de bull run begon

woensdag 30 december 2020, 19:49

In deze Cryptocast kijken we met Bert en Peter Slagter van Lekkercryptisch.nl terug op het afgelopen jaar. Het was het jaar van corona, dat zeker in het begin zijn invloed had op crypto, door de liquiditeitscrisis in maart, met een koersbodem van ongeveer $4000. Ten opzichte van 1 januari ($7000) steeg bitcoin dit jaar met 300% maar ten opzichte van die bodem zelfs met 600%. Het was dus het jaar dat de bull run begon, mede door de toeloop van grote investeerders.

From the COVID-19 pandemic raging across the global population to record-setting wildfires in the western United States to numerous other calamities, the world this year has often appeared figuratively and literally in flames.

Years from now, I believe we will look back on 2020 as a critical inflection point in the wider adoption of crypto-assets and blockchain technology.

From the long-heralded and -awaited arrival of institutional crypto adoption, to the acceleration of digital currency and payments spurred on by the pandemic, to greater regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions like the U.S., 2020 has proven, in my view, to be crypto’s best year yet.

As we head into 2021, what can we expect for crypto?

Two macro forces that have powered the ascent this year of crypto assets like bitcoin to yet another new all-time high show little signs of slowing down.

1. Outsized government spending and money printing

Arguably the single biggest factor driving increased crypto asset valuations and adoption is concern over government spending and monetary stimulus. Indeed, debt levels were already worrisome prior to the pandemic, with many (myself included) sounding the alarm over world-war levels of public indebtedness, sans world war.

However justified the generally bipartisan pandemic stimulus may be, the simple mathematical reality is that when governments and central banks suppress interest rates and increase the money supply, then the value of relatively scarce assets will often increase.

Simply put, more fiat currency and debt chasing a finite number of things (e.g., bitcoin) equals a higher price for those things.

Within the crypto space the biggest winner from this trend is bitcoin, which appears to have achieved broader product market fit this year on Wall Street and elsewhere around its “digital gold” investment thesis.

Indeed, there are some recent indications that, alongside growing inflation fears, some investors are rotating part of their gold portfolio allocation into bitcoin. A continuation of this trend would provide strong support for further bitcoin price appreciation.

With the development of several promising vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying damaging economic restrictions should begin winding down sometime in 2021. However, an unprecedented global debt overhang will remain, creating debt sustainability concerns for the foreseeable future and a bullish tailwind for algorithmically supply-constrained crypto assets.

2. U.S.-China economic and geopolitical tension

Even with the upcoming change in U.S. presidential administrations, geopolitical and strategic competition between the world’s two superpowers – China and the U.S. – is unlikely to abate.

What this evolving clash of superpowers fully means for crypto is something we are still just beginning to understand, but some likely outcomes include:

Increased government spending on a “new Cold War,” exacerbating macro force #1 above

Accelerated rollout of central bank digital currencies

Divided global governance and financial systems

All of these developments are broadly positive for relatively decentralized crypto assets like bitcoin and ether.

While central bank digital currencies may pose challenges for some more centralized crypto asset networks (e.g., stablecoins) in the form of increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, the further digitization of fiat currency and payments is more complementary than competitive for decentralized crypto assets like bitcoin, which will have less design overlap. For example, central bank digital currencies will not feature a finite supply like bitcoin’s 21 million-coin hard cap, and it is also extremely unlikely they will have the same degree of censorship resistance and trust minimization as bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a powerful tool in promoting freedom and open society values.

A divided global governance picture means we are unlikely to see the type of widespread and coordinated regulatory crackdown that hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and others have suggested will occur if crypto ever gets “too big.” And a multi-polar global financial system, carved up into U.S. and Chinese spheres of influence, arguably creates space and motivation for more neutral blockchain-based assets and financial infrastructure.

Money historian Niall Ferguson (my PhD supervisor) also argued recently that part of the reason the U.S. should embrace bitcoin and crypto assets is to support a more privacy conscious and open financial system versus the more centralized one being actively promoted by China via its central bank digital currency, the DCEP.

There’s also the question of who controls or influences the largest public blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks recently fretted over China’s outsized influence over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin through their dominant share of the computational mining power securing blockchain networks. This concern over Chinese influence over Bitcoin and Ethereum was also recently echoed by Ripple in its response to the recently filed Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit.

The growing support for crypto among those concerned with democratic values and the global balance of power could mean we also soon see one of the most positive developments for crypto assets: governments taking a direct role in supporting and even owning crypto assets.

While admittedly speculative, it is possible to imagine the U.S. and China both gaining from more fully embracing crypto assets like bitcoin.

As I have previously argued, an ascendant financial superpower like China could potentially leapfrog up the reserve asset league tables on the cheap by actively acquiring bitcoin. FOMO is not something restricted to private-sector market participants, and first mover nation states will gain the most in any race to acquire a new reserve asset. As an American my hope is the U.S. will think twice before rushing to auction off its latest law enforcement seizure of nearly 70,000 bitcoins connected to the shuttered Silk Road marketplace.

At the same time, the U.S. and other democractic countries may increasingly come to see permissionless and relatively decentralized blockchain networks as similar to the open internet: a powerful tool in promoting freedom and open society values.

Post-pandemic acceleration

While the pandemic and its punishing economic and social restrictions will, I hope, end next year, there is little reason to believe the accelerating crypto adoption we are currently witnessing will end along with it.",2020-12-31 15:00:43+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ethereum-posts-450-gain-in-2020-beats-bitcoin/,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, posted a significant gain in 2020 as the price of ETH increased by more than 450%. Ethereum has performed better than Bitcoin this year.

Ethereum is currently trading around $730, a significant jump from $129 at the start of 2020. On the other hand, the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is hovering around $28,000, compared to around $7,200 at the start of this year. BTC posted a nearly 300% gain since the start of 2020.

ETH price is not the only indicator that shows its performance. Grayscale, a leading cryptocurrency asset management firm reported growing interest in ETH-related investment products earlier this year. Michael Sonnenshein, Managing Director at Grayscale Investments, outlined the growing interest of institutional investors in Ethereum.

“Over the course of 2020, we are seeing a new group of investors who are Ethereum-first and in some cases Ethereum-only. There’s a growing conviction around ETH as an asset class. The development of the asset class has continued to solidify itself,” he mentioned in an interview.

Ethereum’s Price Action

On the last day of 2020, Ethereum touched the $750 mark, its highest level since March 2018. The price of ETH is still far away from its all-time high of $1380, but the recent price action shows that the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is set to test new highs in 2021. ETH’s recent introduction of Beacon Chain and its network upgrade to make the entire system more efficient attracted several institutional investors to participate in Ethereum 2.0 staking. The current market cap of ETH stands at around $83 billion.

Due to the growing interest of investors in Ethereum 2.0, several cryptocurrency exchanges started offering ETH staking services, including Binance.

In its published response to the rule, Elliptic said the rules could “adversely impact” the effectiveness of existing anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations.

Earlier this month, the Treasury Department released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, which laid out that users of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges who wish to move their holdings to their own private wallet, or to someone else’s, would have to provide detailed personal information for transactions greater than $3,000. The exchanges would also be required to report either individual or groups of transactions that add up to more than $10,000.

According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) announcement, the general public will have until Jan. 4 to provide comments or feedback on the rules.

In its response, Elliptic said the rules overstate the risks proposed by unhosted wallets because transactions involving cryptocurrencies can already be traced by analyzing the associated blockchain ledger.

Such analytics are already used by law enforcement to track criminal activity, and therefore, according to Elliptic, the new rules would only add documentation costs for information that can already be accessed using existing means.

The proposed rules were met with concerted pushback even before their release. Regulatory experts said the rules could have widespread repercussions, including on decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.

Concerns include unclearly defined terms such as “unhosted wallets” and the technical inability of financial institutions to collect information from DeFi counterparties.

Data cited by Elliptic shows fewer than 10% of illicit-origin funds remain in unhosted wallets, and the vast majority of them are “simply dormant.” Elliptic noted that since crooked actors are also entirely dependent on their ability to cash-out and convert crypto to fiat, information about such funds is shared with the FinCEN using suspicious activity reports (SAR). Therefore, the proposed rules just add more paperwork.

Also, the Treasury Department’s 15-day comment period on its proposal is “unjustifiably short,” and should be extended to 90 days.",2020-12-31 09:00:11+00:00,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/89771/crypto-stocks-soar-amid-bitcoin-rally,"It's been an blockbuster year for the digital asset market with bitcoin soaring to all-time-highs above $29,000 for the first time.

Intezer’s Avigayil Mechtinger, who specializes in malware analysis, has been tracking the multi-platform worm that installs XMRig Miner to mine the Monero cryptocurrency since early December.

According to Mechtinger, the worm targets public facing MySQL, Tomcat, and Jenkins installations that have weak passwords.

Active and mutating

Explaining the workflow of the worm, Mechtinger writes that the worm scans for Tomcat, Jenkins, and MySQL services with open ports and then brute-forces its way inside. It then delivers a loader script on the compromised server that’ll drop and run the XMRig Miner.

An earlier version of the worm also attempted to exploit the latest vulnerability in WebLogic (CVE-2020-14882). During Mechtinger’s analysis, the attacker kept updating the worm on the Command and Control (C&C) server. This indicates “that it’s active and might be targeting additional weak configured services in future updates,” she writes.

In her report, Mechtinger notes that the worm’s code is “nearly identical” for both Windows and Linux targets, which to her “demonstrates that Linux threats are still flying under the radar for most security and detection platforms.”

Note that this latest worm follows the discovery of the PgMiner worm, which exploited a disputed vulnerability in PostgreSQL servers running on Linux to install a cryptocurrency miner.

Mechtinger also makes note of another trend: “In 2020, we saw a noticeable trend of Golang malware targeting different platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac and Android. We assess with high confidence that this will continue in 2021.”

",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-dollars-and-cbdcs-the-battle-to-come,"By late 2013, it was clear crypto assets would be the future of finance. It was the first time bitcoin crossed $1,000. To the cypherpunks’ chagrin, central banks around the world began publishing warnings to curb the “decentralized genie” threatening the stability of the familiar system. First they ignore you, then they fight.

Bitcoin’s rally stopped short due to a lack of trust and high volatility, rather than any state intervention. That was when people realized crypto assets needed a bridge to financial world, based on our own terms. This was the impetus to create “stable cryptocurrencies,” or stablecoins.

This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Sasha Ivanov is the founder of Waves, a blockchain platform.

From that moment, two different approaches to stabilize crypto asset prices began to develop simultaneously: fiat-backed stable assets and algorithmic stablecoins. While central banks perceived cryptocurrencies as a potential threat to the stability of the financial system and their monopoly in money issuance, it wasn’t until recently that they began to research, develop and experiment their own digital currency (CBDC) alternatives.

While the tension between stablecoins and CBDCs has not come to a head, it is still present to the perceptive. Just look at how China, the European Union and the U.S. responded to the libra (now diem) stablecoin project, for instance. These asset groups, fiat-pegged and algorithmic stablecoins, will eventually compete directly with CBDCs to try to squeeze each other out of the market.

Stablecoins backed by fiat

The first and most common type of stablecoins are fiat-backed tokens on public blockchains, typically denominated in U.S. dollars. The most popular collateralized stablecoins are issued by cryptocurrency exchanges – Bitfinex’s USDT, Coinbase and Circle’s USDC, Binance’s BUSD and Gemini’s GUSD. Tether first appeared in 2014 and is the most popular “crypto dollar” today, with a market cap exceeding $18 billion.

Issuers of fiat-pegged stablecoins typically claim these crypto assets are backed with real dollars, other cryptocurrencies and government bonds, with reserves held in a bank account. This is what preserves a token’s “dollar parity.” Tether’s price, for instance, rarely deviates by more than a tenth of a percent.

See also: Stanford Prof Darrell Duffie on Our Big Stablecoin Future

But it is not easy to verify the real backing of such stablecoins. One has to trust reports of the issuer, that is a crypto company often registered in an offshore jurisdiction, or the occasional attestation by a third party. (The New York State Attorney General’s office is investigating the company Tether’s claims about its reserves.)

Users of fiat-backed stablecoins hardly think about their real backing, as the ease of use exceeds all doubts and risks. The stability of their price is maintained by trust, without using the market or technical methods.

The essence of “collateralized” stablecoins resides in a centralized issuer, an organization that bears economic and legal responsibility, and maintains fiat currency reserves in a bank account. In fact, these are not cryptocurrencies, but tokenized fiat – digital money on the blockchain.

Regulators have already managed to noticeably slow down the release of Libra.

Conceptually, they are similar to payment systems such as PayPal. On the technical side, their main difference is the transparency of transactions, as they pass through public blockchains.

USDT has occupied a big niche in the real economy, as it facilitates international transfers and enables market traders to send money easily from Moscow to China and to many other countries. Instant transfers, low fees and the absence of know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) requirements in some exchanges made classic stablecoins a very convenient tool.

Algorithmic stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins appeared even before their fiat-backed cousins. The first instances were launched on the Bitshares blockchain back in 2013. They were backed exclusively by the blockchain’s basic token, BTS, but were found to not be stable enough.

The most popular decentralized stablecoin, DAI, was launched in 2017, on the Ethereum blockchain. Its U.S. dollar parity is supported by market and technical mechanisms based on smart contracts that implement a price stabilization algorithm. Hence the term “algorithmic.”

An algorithmic stablecoin works on top of a public blockchain and is backed by a base cryptocurrency like ether (ETH). This crypto collateral is locked into a smart contract and a new crypto asset is launched on its basis. Price stability is achieved by a CDP (Collateral Debt Position) mechanism with a collateral surplus of up to 50%, on average. When redeeming their tokens, users receive ETH back into their wallet.

Thus, with the help of price regulation algorithms, a stable crypto asset is created without the participation of fiat currencies and the necessity of connection to the traditional financial system. Algorithmic stablecoins work like cryptocurrencies. Unlike USDT and its analogues, they are decentralized and are not subject to a single issuer and regulators.

The crypto industry is now dominated by collateralized stablecoins. And while they are capable of maintaining a dollar peg, algorithmic stablecoins can be quite volatile during crises.

Algorithmic stablecoins are widely used in the DeFi industry, but they cannot yet go beyond it. They have yet to be used in real economic operations.

State and bank stablecoins

In late 2013 and early 2014, most central banks issued initial statements and warnings about crypto assets. But it wasn’t until Facebook pitched libra, that they really kick-started their own digital currency R&D.

As of this year, there are nearly 50 ongoing central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots or research projects. A CBDC could be a natural progression of money, as central banks are already familiar with running cashless transactions, with the benefit of increased financial transparency.

The main advantage of private bank stablecoins is the large distribution, user base and strong reputation of traditional financial institutions.

Earlier this year, the European Union, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), began work on a joint study and coordination of the issue of CBDCs. In 2021, experiments with CBDCs are expected to begin in the European Union.

In October, the Bank of Russia presented plans to create a digital ruble. And in China, a pilot project to test the digital yuan in the real economy is already underway. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been conducting research for several years, but dates for the issue of a digital dollar have not yet been determined.

With the release of CBDCs, central banks strive to create a controlled, secure and stable monetary system that will reduce incentives for the creation of cryptocurrencies and other private money. CBDCs will be supported by central banks in the same way as national currencies and will have the status of legal tender.

So far, two state cryptocurrencies have been issued. Venezuela was the first country to release a state digital currency, called the petro, in 2018. However, its turnover is not transparent and its collateralization and use in the real economy are seriously questionable. In late October, the central bank of the Bahamas released its “sand dollar” CBDC. It is regulated similarly to the Bahamian dollar and is accepted throughout the island state.

Trends in stablecoin development

From the end user’s point of view, CBDCs and bank tokens are very similar to fiat-backed stablecoins. Therefore, these three asset groups will compete directly and try to squeeze each other out of the market.

The main advantage of private bank stablecoins is the large distribution, user base and strong reputation of traditional financial institutions. People will use them like other banking products, in the same applications. That’s why stablecoins issued by private companies, such as jpmcoin and libra, are causing serious concerns for regulators.

Given that, traditional crypto stablecoins may not be needed. They are likely to survive but will be under a lot of regulatory pressure and their volumes will drop significantly. Their functions will be taken over by banks and CBDCs.

CBDCs have the strongest positions thanks to the administrative resources behind them. Regulators have already managed to noticeably slow down the release of libra, and perhaps this token will not appear on the market until all legal issues are resolved. The state will aim to completely overtake the niche of “blockchain digital money” as it does not need any outside players in this area. This process is already underway in China at the level of a pilot project – millions of Chinese in several regions are using the digital yuan, and their number will only grow.

Wide spread of CBDCs and elimination of cash are very interesting prospects for governments. This is the real basis for a modern financial infrastructure of the state in the 21st century, where it has full control over all transactions, cash flows of individuals and of companies.

There is no need for physical audits because all the transactions are made visible by the technology behind them, making it impossible to hide anything. More central banks will sooner or later adopt this concept, with different levels of control and possible privacy for citizens.

Strengthening control

The crypto community will respond to the strengthening of state control with new and improved decentralized stable crypto assets. It is in uncertain situations that algorithmic stablecoins, which do not depend on banks and regulators, can prove themselves.

There is a need for cryptocurrency stability mechanisms built into blockchain architectures, and for cryptocurrencies with an inherently stable price, rather than a superstructure built over already volatile instruments.

In the crypto industry, they will take over the functions now performed by USDT and other collateralized stablecoins. They will become true stable cryptocurrencies, rather than just digital money.

To create them, similar mechanisms to traditional bond markets are possible, just like the dollar is supported by treasury bonds. To do this, a token must be issued on a blockchain with already built-in stability. Such mechanisms have not been developed yet.

On the other hand, against the backdrop of the pandemic and accelerated money issuance with governments worldwide, fiat currencies are depreciating more and more quickly. As such, the idea of pegging cryptocurrencies to declining fiat currencies becomes a dangerous play.

Key Takeaways Bittrex has decided to delist XMR, ZEC, and DASH.

Though some observers have pointed to regulation, the reason for the exchange's decision is unclear.

Other exchanges have previously delisted privacy coins.

Share this article

Crypto exchange Bittrex has chosen to remove three of the cryptocurrency space’s leading privacy coins. The exchange will delist Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH) on Jan. 15.

Bittrex Takes Drastic Action



News of the delisting was shared via the company’s blog this week, though no reason was given for the decision.

All three tokens are often described as privacy-preserving crypto coins. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, privacy coins keep transaction amounts and addresses hidden.

Some have speculated that the delisting is a response to regulatory pressures. In particular, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), announced new anti-money laundering measures last month, which may have led Bittrex to delist the three coins.

Bittrex notes that trading will close at 18:00 Eastern Time on Jan. 15. Users will have up to 30 days to withdraw their assets, though “in certain instances the withdrawal period may be shortened.”

The three coins have taken a significant price hit since the news attracted wider attention this afternoon. XMR and ZEC are both down about 9.5% over the past 24 hours, while DASH is down 8.9%.

Widespread Delistings

In the past, other exchanges have delisted privacy coins as well. OKEx Korea and Upbit stopped trading the same coins in 2019 for similar reasons. Bitbay also delisted Monero shortly after.

Bittrex’s actions are exceptional, though, as it is one of the first major first U.S.-based exchanges to delist all three coins. It remains to be seen whether other exchanges will follow suit, or whether Bittrex’s delisting will even have a lasting effect on the cryptocurrency market.

The move follows Bittrex’s decision to halt trading on XRP due to Ripple’s ongoing clash with the SEC. Numerous other exchanges have made the same decision.

At the time of this writing this author held ETH, UNI, ADA, BAT, IOTA, and other altcoins.

This article was updated to reflect the fact that other U.S.-based exchanges including Shapeshift previously delisted all three coins.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has announced that it will soon propose new regulation affecting cryptocurrency holdings at foreign exchanges. This proposal is separate from the one FinCEN recently proposed on cryptocurrency wallets.

FinCEN’s New Crypto Rules

FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued a notice on Thursday regarding a new filing requirement for cryptocurrencies. FinCEN detailed:

Currently, the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) regulations do not define a foreign account holding virtual currency as a type of reportable account.

The notice adds that the bureaus “intends to propose to amend the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regarding reports of foreign financial accounts (FBAR) to include virtual currency as a type of reportable account.”

Shehan Chandrasekera, Head of Tax Strategy at Cointracker, explained that “FBAR is a form you file with your tax return if you have any foreign financial assets over 10K at any time of the year.” He clarified, “There are no taxes to be paid with this form, just additional disclosure.”

Marc Boiron, attorney at Manatt, commented: “Goodbye non-US exchanges … FBARs will need to be filed for non-US virtual currency accounts.” He emphasized:

Accidentally failing to file an FBAR can result in a civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation.

“Another example of US regulatory overreach,” Adam Cochran, Duckduckgo’s strategist, opined. “Utterly insane – but this rule will be something FinCEN would use to go after international exchanges more broadly.”

Lawyer Jake Chervinsky described that this proposal “seems targeted at users of non-US exchanges” and he believes that it “shouldn’t apply to assets in self-custody.” He suggested that the reason for the proposal might be either tax evasion or “bringing non-US crypto companies into compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.” FinCEN is also currently trying to implement rules concerning crypto wallets before the end of the Trump term.

What do you think about this new rule FinCEN will propose? Let us know in the comments section below.

It was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin fell to an early morning intraday low $28,716.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $27,902, Bitcoin rose to an early morning high $29,488.0.

Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell back to sub-$29,000 levels.

Finding support through the late morning, however, Bitcoin struck a mid-day intraday high and a new swing high $29,620.0.

Coming within range of the first major resistance level at $29,631, Bitcoin slid back to $28,700 levels.

A late move back through to $29,300 levels delivered the upside for the day, however.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, supported by the latest breakthrough to $29,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $13,787 to form a near-term bearish trend.

Across the rest of the majors, it was another mixed day on Friday.

Polkadot slid by 11.83% to lead the way down.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.80%), Cardano’s ADA (-3.44%), and Ethereum (-0.94%) also struggled.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.

Bitcoin Cash SV and Crypto.com Coin bucked the trend early on, with gains of 0.70 and 3.23% respectively.

It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Chainlink was down by 2.14% to lead the way down.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move back through the pivot level at $29,228 to bring the first major resistance level at $29,741 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from Friday’s high $29,620.0.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $30,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of another extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $30,500 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $30,132.

Failure to move back through the $29,228 pivot would bring the first major support level at $28,837 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$28,500 levels. The second major support level sits at $28,324.

More From FXEMPIRE:",,https://www.coindesk.com/stablecoins-unsung-heroes-and-other-institutional-crypto-takeaways,"It is clear that crypto is having its institutional moment. The investment decision is moving from speculation to allocation, and we are witnessing the maturation of crypto and digital asset investors in the process. In formalizing a dedicated digital asset investment strategy, institutional investors should assess the landscape thoughtfully with the goal of building an optimally constructed portfolio to achieve their desired investment objectives. Below, we summarize our top 10 takeaways from 2020 for institutional investors, based on our recent report “An Institutional Take on the 2020/2021 Digital Asset Market.”

This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Dan Zuller, CFA, is a partner at Vision Hill Group, an investment consultant and asset manager in digital assets.

1. Active management roars back.

Following a challenging 2019 market in which concentration in bitcoin (largely viewed as the market’s beta, or its headline volatility indicator) prevailed over distinctive asset diversification, active management came roaring back in 2020. According to VisionTrack data as of October 2020, crypto hedge funds generated net returns of +116% on average, outperforming bitcoin (+92%) by approximately 2,400 basis points (bps).

2. For investors, 2020 was the year of DeFi and asset selection.

DeFi stands for decentralized finance and can be best thought of as an emerging sector within the frontier digital asset market. Total value locked in DeFi contracts surged 25x to ~$15 billion as of the end of November, from ~$600 million in January. Investors that put capital to work in this thematic sector of digital assets generally outperformed bitcoin and the digital asset market beta in 2020.

3. Digital asset yields are sustainable, for now.

Digital assets offer highly attractive yields compared to traditional market instruments such as high-yield savings accounts. Will that continue? Growing demand from institutional counterparties and borrowers such as hedge funds, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, market makers and liquidity providers leads us to believe these yields are sustainable for the foreseeable future.

4. The remarkable rise, fall and rise again of crypto derivatives.

After a challenging 2018-2019 market regime, crypto derivatives have made a fascinating comeback in 2020. CME BTC daily futures volumes recently peaked at $2.2 billion at the end of November 2020 while Bakkt BTC daily futures volumes peaked at $178 million in September. “First a trickle and then a flood,” once the industry’s mantra back in 2018-2019, has proven true in 2020.

5. Crypto hedge funds are institutionalizing, but some more than others.

There are now a variety of beta- and alpha-focused hedge fund strategies rising to institutional “gold standards” in preparation for 2021. However, not all managers are evolving with the times. According to our VisionTrack database, approximately one in four managers have shuttered their funds since 2017 as a result of failed operations.

6. There’s liquid and there’s venture, but liquid venture is a tougher pitch.

The distinction between liquid hedge fund strategies (primarily liquid, short-term) and illiquid venture fund strategies (primarily illiquid, long-term) continues to be clear. However, the digital asset market continues to have hybrid “liquid venture” funds that attempt to capture the best of both the liquid and private worlds. While the opportunity set for such funds is certainly expanded, such strategies are not without their complexities and challenges.

7. Simplicity prevails: How the easy trades continue to win (and scale).

Throughout 2020, we continued to see investors prefer the simpler trades in the market. One of the most popular examples of this is the success of Grayscale’s investment trust products. Given the lack of a regulated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, investors have sought high quality, single asset vehicles, specifically bitcoin-only ones, to express their investment thesis in digital assets. There are also strong incentives for investors to maintain simplicity and capture the beta first when entering an emerging market. [Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.]

8. As the bull returns, beta competes against venture for capital.

Investors who allocated to venture funds as of Jan. 1, 2020, expecting a 3.0x return multiple over eight to 10 years would have achieved 90% of their return target and remained liquid in just the first 11 months of 2020 if they allocated to BTC instead. An allocation to ETH would have performed even better (4.7x return).

9. Stablecoins have become the market’s unsung heroes.

The rise of stablecoins boosted liquidity in the crypto market and enabled digital asset trading to become cheaper, faster and stablecoin-denominated. In 2020, the market capitalization of stablecoins has nearly quintupled from just under $5 million in 2019 to nearly $27 billion at the time of writing.

10. From speculators to allocators: witnessing crypto’s investor maturation.

While the crypto industry has witnessed some occasional institutional moments since 2018, none quite resulted in direct price appreciation the way 2020’s institutional movement did. Tudor Investment Corporation, Rothschild Investment Corp., Fidelity, JPMorgan, Raoul Pal, Stanley Druckenmiller, Citibank, Guggenheim, Alliance Bernstein, BlackRock, Square and MicroStrategy, to name a few, have enhanced bitcoin’s social proof this year.

A 2021 look ahead

We believe we are in the early phases of a 12- to 24-month bull market cycle in digital assets as part of a multi-decade long investment opportunity. Crypto investing is increasingly moving from speculation to allocation as high-quality institutional capital leads the current cycle. In 2021, it will be even more important to have a dedicated and intentional strategy to express the digital asset investment thesis.

There are now many different ways to invest into the growing digital asset class, ranging from single or multi-asset passive beta strategies to differentiated venture fund and hedge fund strategies. We expand on each of these in more detail below.

Beta

Passive strategies can be accessed via single asset vehicles (e.g. BTC only) or index funds for multi-asset exposure. Reported assets under management (AUM) in VisionTrack is now $13.6 billion for passive beta strategies and expected to grow significantly in 2021.

We believe bitcoin will continue to be the first stop for many allocators who are new to digital assets. It is reasonable to assume that in order to build conviction in this asset class, allocators need to get comfortable with the general notion of how a blockchain works, and why its value proposition is unique relative to everything else in their investable universe (that may also come with longer and more established track records of success). In 2021, investors are also likely to expand their definition of beta to include ether in addition to bitcoin.

Venture

Venture funds in crypto generally focus on equity only, tokens only or equity and tokens across various stages from a structural perspective. We estimate dedicated crypto venture fund AUM to be in excess of $10 billion.

We believe we will see continued growth of dedicated crypto venture fund strategies into 2021. In addition to Fund II’s and Fund III’s, 2021 more focus is likely to turn to thematic differentiation (e.g. DeFi vs. infrastructure), structural differentiation (equity vs. tokens), stage differentiation (pre-seed, Series A, growth stage), and geographic differentiation (U.S., Asia, emerging markets, etc.).

Hedge funds

At Vision Hill, we segment all crypto hedge funds into one of three strategy categories: fundamental, quantitative and opportunistic. There is currently $2.4 billion in dedicated crypto hedge fund AUM in VisionTrack.

We believe 2021 will be a breakout year for crypto hedge funds. With an expected bullish market regime, we expect distinctive (idiosyncratic) asset selection will present opportunities for differentiated and uncorrelated outperformance (alpha).

Preparing for 2021",2021-01-01 16:00:47+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/9-trillion-vs-100-trillion-billionaire-mike-novogratz-asks-which-cryptocurrency-will-win-the-payments-race/,"9 Trillion vs. 100 Trillion: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Asks Which Cryptocurrency Will Win the Payments Race

On December 31, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz asked his Twitter followers which blockchain coin has the best chance of winning the payments race and offered four choices. Novogratz said there are lots of “contenders” and listed off Facebook’s diem, tether, bitcoin cash, and Circle’s popular stablecoin.

This week Mike Novogratz asked his Twitter followers out of diem, bitcoin cash, USDC, and tether (USDT), which coin “has best chance of winning payments?” Novogratz said that there were a lot of contenders and asked his followers to give him their thoughts on which coin would dominate. The tweet received a lot of replies and many crypto asset proponents discussed Novogratz’s question and had a number of interesting theories.

“Diem has Facebook network effect,” one individual replied. “But will be very watched by regulators. Still should be #1 candidate if FB delivers. USDC should eventually take over tether as it is U.S. based and less shady. Paypal could be a surprise challenger. Decentralised stable such as empty set dollars too,” the person added.

“LINK will be the ultimate winner,” another person responded. “Platform winners obviously ETH, possibly DIEM and lookout for AVAX. 2021 will be the year of stablecoin experiments, with multiple custodial stablecoins being born and plenty of money made and lost in algo stablecoins. USDT and USDC reign.”

Of course, a great number of bitcoin cash (BCH) supporters took to the Novogratz tweet and discussed the benefits of BCH as a payments rail.

“Bitcoin Cash hands down— Many BCH projects have been funded,” the bitcoin cash enthusiast Wizewizzz tweeted to Novogratz. “[Five] development teams are innovating on the scaling front [and the] community is laser-focused on adoption [and] utility in the real world. BCH aims to be sound peer to peer electronic cash— No other project comes even close.”

General Protocols’ developer Jonathan Silverblood responded to Novogratz and said that for payments, “value has to be stable by default.”

“This gives USDC and tether a clear advantage today, but it also has to be cost-efficient,” Silverblood added. “For this reason, I believe that the winner doesn’t exist yet. Out of the current contenders, I work on and believe in [bitcoin cash] BCH as the rails. In particular, I do so because they are focusing on the right use case, and are innovating in this field specifically.”

There was also bitcoin (BTC) supporters who believe BTC is a store-of-value (SoV), but that also the Lightning Network (LN) can act as a payment rail.

“Not a coin. A protocol. The SoV it routes will be agnostic. Lightning has a fair chance,” the well known data analyst Willy Woo tweeted to Novogratz in response to his payments coin tweet.

However, a great number of crypto advocates responded to Woo’s speculation and said that the LN can “only work with good UX if crypto works like the gold standard, you need to trust custodians.”

Another person added: “[The Lightning Network] is not even secure against Flood and Loot attack.” Some individuals also said layer 2 solutions will be hosted on the Ethereum (ETH) network first.

Many crypto-asset supporters believe that while a store-of-value (SoV) like gold holds a $9 trillion market capitalization, the liquid payments market is much larger.

Blockchain payment rails offering a reliable and inexpensive peer-to-peer electronic cash solution are effectively targeting the world’s cash market or the global M1. In comparison to the precious metal gold’s $9 trillion, the $100 trillion liquid payments market is 1011% larger than the SoV.

@ techlooter Andrej Kovacevic A dedicated writer and digital evangelist.

Not so long ago, the buzz in cybersecurity circles was all about COVID-19 and how malicious actors were exploiting the panic via a wave of targeted phishing attempts. Well, much to everyone's relief, the trend didn't last long. Some of that is due to security firms getting the word out so quickly, and some of it is due to the general public becoming more aware of potential threats and behaving with more care as they encounter suspicious situations.

But although the pandemic-fueled attacks didn't gain much traction, the bad guys didn't stop trying. They just started to shift their tactics back to some of the more tried-and-true methods they'd been using in the past. For that reason, businesses and individuals have to continue to keep their guard up in the face of innumerable threats to their data and digital privacy. To help, here's a roundup of the latest data-identified trends in cybersecurity as 2020 winds down.

Ransomware and Credential Harvesting Dominate

According to the recent Microsoft Digital Defense Report, the latest data indicates malicious actors ramping up attacks using ransomware and credential harvesting. That reflects a return to form following the brief spike in COVID-19 social engineering attacks, which turned out to peak in March and all but disappear by April.

The most notable example of late came from Universal Health Services, a major hospital chain with over 400 facilities spread throughout the United States, United Kingdom, and Puerto Rico. They suffered a crippling ransomware attack that knocked the majority of their network offline in late September – an attack from which they still haven't fully recovered from at the time of this writing.

And just days ago, reports started to surface about a shadowy international hacking group known as Bahamut, which was found to have engaged in years-long target surveillance and credential harvesting operations. They're the latest in a long string of hacker-for-hire groups uncovered in recent years and an example of how effective credential harvesting is as an attack vector and why it's a constant go-to for hackers of all stripes.

Nation-States Increasing Attacks

Although it should come as no surprise, the latest data also shows a dramatic uptick in state-sponsored cyberattacks in recent months. This is partly due to the US election season being in full swing, which always presents a target-rich environment for determined US adversaries. But this year it isn't just the election driving attacks.

There's also some remaining blowback surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, late July saw a coordinated, all-out assault on Australian government systems and private networks. The attacks are believed to be the work of China, as part of that country's pushback against international questions surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 virus.

It was an attack that further highlighted cybersecurity vulnerabilities that exist at the national level, as Australia continues to suffer from a shortage of cybersecurity professionals. That shortage remains despite a nationwide push to increase the availability of cybersecurity degree programs in recent years and mirrors a similar talent gap that exists in the US, EU, and elsewhere.

IoT Threats Proliferate

Continuing a trend that's been building for the last few years, 2020 has seen a surge of attacks both on and using IoT devices. A recent report by Nozomi Networks highlighted this fact and pointed out that the sudden shift to work-from-home all around the world was a likely culprit. It also noted how many IoT botnets continue to cause trouble around the world, including some well-worn options like Dark Nexus, Mukashi, and LeetHoser.

Even more troubling was a recent finding that some 98% of IoT devices continue to rely on unencrypted communications, further increasing their vulnerability to attack. That means we've likely just seen the tip of the iceberg concerning IoT takeovers and network penetrations. And with so many workers connecting to corporate resources while working from home, that staggering vulnerability could soon turn into a major headache for big companies all around the globe.

What to Expect in 2021

As we enter 2021, it doesn't appear likely that any of the above trends are going to shift soon. There's every reason to believe that they'll continue well into this new year, barring any unforeseen changes in the technology landscape. The only thing that experts seem to agree on is that we're going to see the pace and ferocity of digital threats continue to increase.

Most cybersecurity researchers expect that the pace of cyberattacks will increase, with businesses suffering an attack every 11 seconds – down from 17 seconds today. That translates to an increased attack volume of between 20%-40%, depending on which statistics you look at. That means already overwhelmed businesses, governments, and individuals are going to have their hands even more full in 2021.

I'm sure that's not something anyone wants to hear at this point, but as they say, to be forewarned is to be forearmed. So be on guard for the types of attacks identified here – and get ready for an even tougher year to come.

Digital currency markets have seen decent gains this weekend as bitcoin touched another all-time high (ATH) on Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, a number of other crypto assets have seen significant price rises as well, as the entire market capitalization of all 7,500+ digital currencies in existence is hovering above the $800 billion mark.

The $800 Billion Crypto Economy

This weekend, bitcoin (BTC) spiked to a new all-time high at $33,333 per unit and since then the price has dropped some after the ATH. At the time of publication, BTC is hovering above the $32k handle as the crypto asset has climbed 19.9% during the last week. The cryptocurrency bitcoin has an overall market valuation of around $602 billion, which brings the bitcoin dominance index to just over 71%.

Meanwhile, the second-largest market capitalization held by ethereum (ETH) is hovering around $88.6 billion. ETH has jumped over 21% this week, 25.4% during the last month, 119% over the 90-day span, and 12-months stats show ETH is up 474%. Currently, ethereum is swapping for $777 per unit and has around $4.8 billion in global trade volume. Further, ever since the recent SEC charges against XRP, the digital currency cap has dropped well below tether’s (USDT) market valuation.

The digital currency XRP is trading for $0.219 per token. XRP is down -24% during the last seven days, -64% for the month, -10% over the three-month span, but 12 months stats against the USD show XRP is up 14.6%. The fifth-largest position is held by litecoin (LTC) which is trading for $137 per coin. LTC jumped 5.2% this week, and 52% during the last 30 days. 90-day stats show LTC has gained 191% and around 222% for the whole year.

Polkadot (DOT) is the sixth-largest market today as the token trades for $9.08 per unit. DOT is up a whopping 77% this week and 69% during the last 30 days. Bitcoin cash (BCH) currently holds the seventh-largest market position on Saturday as each coin is swapping for $362 per BCH. Bitcoin cash is up over 9% this week, 20% this month, and 59% during the last three months. BCH has a market valuation of around $6.7 billion and $984 million in global trade volume.

During the course of the day, as bitcoin crossed a new price range into the $30k zone a great number of bitcoin supporters celebrated. The digital asset strategist and director at Vaneck, Gabor Gurbacs, tweeted about bitcoin’s valuation exceeding any of the top ten global banks by market capitalization.

Moreover, The Block CEO Mike Dudas tweeted about selling a small percentage of holdings. “I sold 10% of my bitcoin today as part of a plan I put in place years ago,” Dudas said. “I plan to hold much of my BTC forever, but I also want to enjoy life with my family in 2021. If you’ve had a plan in place for many years, stick with it. Much [love] and prosperity friends.”

After the day’s momentum, the popular trader Mr. Anderson explained that someday BTC may jump $10k in one day. “We spent a lot of time fighting for the $10,000 level the last couple of years,” he tweeted. “In 2021, BTC will see a $10,000 Daily candle,” he added.

Another individual wrote: “Hyperinflation is happening and will continue to happen in 2021 – globally. If you want to see it, just pull-up a bitcoin chart.”

Gold Bug Peter Schiff Is Not Impressed

However, not everyone fancied the high crypto prices, as the long time bitcoin hater and gold bug, Peter Schiff had to throw in his two cents during the day’s bitcoin runup. “If you never sell your bitcoin, what difference does the price make?” Schiff asked on Twitter. “When it ultimately goes to zero, the percentage loss for all HODLers will be the same, 100%. The significant difference will be how much you pay, not the price. Those who “invest” the most will lose the most,” the famed economist added.

Schiff further said:

Gold is a store of value as people buying gold now will be able to sell it in the future to buyers who actually need to use gold as a metal. Bitcoin’s value comes from the belief that it can be resold at a higher price in the future to speculators willing to make the same bet.

Still, Schiff wasn’t done after his second tweet, and had to throw in one last statement against the leading cryptocurrency. “The only valid reason to buy bitcoin is thinking the bubble will get much bigger before it bursts,” Schiff tweeted. “Most bitcoin buyers don’t know it’s a bubble so they will never sell. But since most who do will be unable to tell when it’s popped, they’re also unlikely to get out with a profit.”

Meanwhile, the honey badger and the $800 billion crypto-economy doesn’t seem to care about Schiff’s Twitter noise.

A global health pandemic, multiple stock market shocks, the destabilizing of the workforce and many sectors of the economy. After a year of living with COVID-19, consumer and investor behavior has taken on new characteristics as digital and sustainable business and finance have taken off in parallel.

At a moment like this, emerging technologies such as tokenization and blockchain technology are more relevant than ever – and have been presented with a profound opportunity. As traditional markets are in crisis, investors are seeking refuge in cryptographically sound currencies, propelling bitcoin to new all-time price highs. Meanwhile, alternative asset classes such as ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investments have gained ground amongst investors, crossing $1 trillion in funds for the first time on record.

This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Mohammad Raafi Hossain is co-founder and CEO of Fasset, a crypto exchange in the Middle East.

As we continue to witness new highs in the digital asset and ESG markets, it is time to consider whether these two growing sectors have the potential to benefit and support one another.

As impact investments and ESG-friendly funds increase in popularity, the cryptocurrency community has an opportunity to capture some of this momentum through the use of tokenization technology. By leveraging investor appetite for these asset classes, it may be possible to accelerate the maturation of the digital assets sector, along with the acceptance of asset-backed tokens and other digital assets in more traditional financial circles.

Impact investing

Arguably one of the fastest-growing asset classes, ESG investments are expected to reach half of all investor portfolios by 2025, totaling $35 trillion. This is partially the result of more investors recognizing ESG-friendly assets as an effective hedge against volatility and downside risk – with some 69% of investors crediting them as such, according to a State Street survey.

While ESG funds saw record flows in 2019, investor activity has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This effect has been compounded by climate crises, socioeconomic seachanges and protest movements across numerous major economies, leading to greater attention to the ways in which companies are doing business and where capital is being placed.

The newfound appetite for ESG investments is good news for society at large. As the world faces widening socioeconomic gaps and unemployment across the world, impact investing could play a prominent role in mitigating these challenges. Investments into transportation infrastructure, for example, can create over 21,000 jobs with every $1 billion invested. Considering these sizable socioeconomic externalities, this asset class could play a vital role in shaping the recovery and future of the global economy.

An uphill battle

Unlocking these potential benefits does not come without challenges. On average, there is an annual need for investments of $6.9 trillion into sustainable infrastructure between 2016 to 2030 to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As public bodies and governments struggle to fund this development, the funding gap for these projects is expected to hit $15 trillion by 2040. This means that private capital will be increasingly required to plug the gap.

However, where private investments are concerned, there are numerous barriers to entry to the sustainable development investment market from low levels of liquidity, large ticket sizes and a lack of optionality, to high overhead and entry costs and limited transparency. Faced with these significant market imperfections, investors could benefit from the deployment of digital assets and tokenization as promising solutions to the ESG sector’s problems.

The world faces widening socioeconomic gaps and unemployment and impact investing could play a prominent role in mitigating these challenges.

Spanning the physical, financial and digital worlds, tokenized ESG investments, such as wind or solar farms, could provide sustainable infrastructure asset owners with new avenues for capital accumulation to fund developments of such projects. Similarly, through the tokenization of ESG-friendly investments, issues surrounding market access, lack of liquidity and prohibitively high costs and fees for investors would be overcome seamlessly.

As these assets become more liquid, accessible and tradable. Investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with low-risk, highly-resilient assets would be drawn to the digital assets space, potentially converting traditional financial actors to cryptocurrency market participants.

A mutual benefit

Currently, decentralized finance (DeFi) is the fastest-growing pocket within the crypto space, creating tremendous incentives and traction among retail and institutional investors. While DeFi has often been characterized by innovative on-chain solutions, some critics have pointed out there has been limited “real-world value” generated as a result of ongoing experimentation.

While tokenization technologies stand to substantially benefit the ESG community, they could also serve the purpose of bringing real, off-chain, substantive value to the digital assets market in the form of tokenized sustainable infrastructure. As ESG-friendly investments increase in popularity and prove extremely appealing to traditional finance, tokenized impact investments could serve as a vehicle for greater crypto adoption and digital assets’ acceptance in institutional and political circles.

I've spent the last 2 months building a game, CovidInvaders to help spread awareness about the new Coronavirus vaccine.

In this post, I'll be explaining how I built this game with just HTML, CSS, Jquery, and some Python.

Days 1-7: I Brainstormed How The Game Would Look, Work, & How I Would Build It

Disclaimer: My friend, Roman Peysakhovich inspired me to create the game CovidInvaders. Around 1 week before I began brainstorming how I would build the game, he said it could help spread awareness about the vaccine.

For the first 2 weeks, I spent my days brainstorming the game's design with the goal of building the best user experience.

Initially, I wanted to design Covid Invaders with a similar design to a classic game, Space Invaders.

However, after a few days above brainstorming how my game could be unique, I decided on a horizontal design instead of a vertical design like Space Invaders because it would give the user more time to shoot syringes at the virus.

Now, it was time to begin designing.

After working with a design agency for almost 6 months now, I've learned a lot about design, as well as how to implement designs properly with HTML and CSS.

Working with a professional design agency has also taught me how to communicate to a designer about how I want the application/game/landing page to look like.

So, after about 2 weeks of collaborating with the design agency, DesignJoy, this is what we came up with:

Now, it was time to start coding.

Days 20-57: I Developed The Game With HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Jquery, and Python

Ever since teaching myself how to code when I was 11 years old, I learned an important lesson:

Developing an application or website is only the first piece of the puzzle. The second piece many developers don't have is to actually write clean and maintainable code.

It's very important to write code that's easy to work with and understand, and that was always in the back of my mind when I was developing CovidInvaders.

I'm not saying my code is perfect, but I definitely have improved in the ""code cleanliness"" part of web development.

I won't go too much into the exact code I wrote to make CovidInvaders a reality, but here's a brief summary:

Implemented the designs with just HTML and CSS. Fell asleep on the couch in my living room. Implemented the game functionality with Vanilla JS, and Jquery. Implemented the backend using Python to make the leaderboard save the user's name and score after the game ends.

Days 57-59: I Made Sure The Game Was Easy To Use On All Devices (Desktop, Tablet, & Mobile)

After implementing the designs and adding functionality with JS, I spent the next 2 days fixing any CSS issues on different screen sizes.

This wasn't a straightforward process for mainly two reasons:

Because the game is designed horizontally. Because I needed to implement arrow keys for mobile devices (since phones don't have keyboards).

However, with lots of breaks and a few naps, I managed to fix the CSS issues that appeared on mobile devices.

I Free-styled A Rap Song To Teach Players How To Play CovidInvaders

At this point, I was pretty much ready to launch CovidInvaders to its custom domain, covidinvaders.com. However, I wanted to add one final touch.

An original rap song (free-styled by yours truly) that would help players understand how to play CovidInvaders.

So, I jumped to Youtube, downloaded a free instrumental beat, and recorded away.

10 minutes later, this song was born:

Kill The Virus - Official Audio

After adding the song to the codebase, I deployed the site to covidinvaders.com, and the rest is history.

Okay, not really, that's a lie. I'm still trying to fix some CSS bugs I found in the dev console.
